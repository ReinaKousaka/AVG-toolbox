The first frame presents a rainy city street view. In the immediate foreground to the right, a tree trunk, a grey utility box, and a purple electric scooter are visible on a wet sidewalk, edged by a yellow curb and a storm drain. A wet asphalt road, marked with white lane lines and double yellow lines, extends from the viewer into the distance. A silver car is parked on the right side of the road, and faint headlights appear further down the street. Tall buildings displaying Korean signage line the left side of the street, interspersed with trees, while an overpass is visible in the hazy distance under an overcast, rainy sky.

Across the subsequent frames, the heavy rain continues to fall, causing the glistening reflections on the wet road to subtly undulate and shimmer. Tiny splashes and ripples from the falling raindrops are consistently visible on both the street and sidewalk surfaces. No new objects are revealed, nor do any existing elements exhibit significant movement or changes in their spatial positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a wet city street on an overcast day, viewed from a sidewalk looking down a multi-lane road. To the viewer's immediate right are a tree, a gray utility box, and a parked silver car, beyond which a bus stop sign and more buildings line the sidewalk. On the left, numerous storefronts with Korean signs and trees extend into the hazy distance, where the road gently curves right with visible lane markings reflecting the light.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the intensity of the rainfall visibly increases, creating more splashes and disturbed reflections across the wet road surface. The parked silver car on the right briefly illuminates its brake lights in frames 2-3 before they dim again. Subtle movement of distant vehicles, including a yellow taxi appearing further down the road on the left, is also visible as the rain continues to fall.
