The first frame depicts a sunny city street intersection from a low-angle perspective, with grey asphalt and white crosswalk markings prominent in the foreground and midground. In the far-left foreground, the back of a person wearing a dark jacket and backpack is visible, walking away. To the right in the midground, a row of motorcycles is parked along the curb in front of a building, with several people standing near them and two trees with bright green leaves overhead. On the crosswalk, slightly right of center in the midground, a woman in a black jacket walks towards the viewer, while other pedestrians are visible further left beyond the intersection. Tall buildings line both sides of the street in the background, with a green traffic light and "Howe St" sign on the left.
end of description
The person in the foreground-left continues walking away, gradually moving towards the bottom-left edge and out of the frame. The woman in the midground-center steadily walks closer towards the viewer on the crosswalk, progressing into the foreground. From the midground-left, a light-colored car enters the scene, driving across the intersection towards the right, appearing behind the group of pedestrians already present on the far side of the street. These far-side pedestrians continue walking further left relative to the viewer's initial position. The people and motorcycles parked along the curb in the midground-right remain largely static.

The first frame shows a bustling city street where a woman in a black jacket, holding a green device, walks towards the viewer from the center-right. To the left, a street intersection with a "Howe St" sign and green traffic light frames other pedestrians, while on the right, multiple motorcycles are parked near a building under a tree with bright green foliage.
end of description
Through subsequent frames, the woman continues walking past the viewer to the right, revealing her device as an open book. Simultaneously, a new person enters from the far left and walks towards the mid-left, as the initial pedestrian on the left moves further away. The individuals near the motorcycles on the right remain mostly static.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, multiple motorcycles are parked on the right side of the street, with a man in a helmet near the rightmost one. Above them, a tree with vibrant green leaves stands next to a modern building featuring large glass windows and the sign "EYES INSPIRE." To the left, a man in a maroon jacket walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk, followed by other pedestrians, all beside a tall street light pole with traffic lights and street signs like "Howe St." Further left, more multi-story buildings line the street.
end of description
Following frames show a large, dark grey metallic sculpture, resembling a wave or whale tail, emerging from the building facade on the right, above "THE POINT" sign, extending outwards and then retracting back into the building. Concurrently, the pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue to move forward, progressing further away from the viewer's initial position.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, two motorcycles are parked in the lower right foreground. Immediately behind them, a tall utility pole stands slightly right of center, obscuring part of a modern building with large glass windows on the right, which displays "EYES INSPIRE" and has a person leaning against its facade. To the left, a city street extends into the distance with a sidewalk occupied by several pedestrians, a green traffic light, and various multi-story buildings and bare trees. The sky is bright blue with scattered clouds.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the two motorcycles on the right rapidly disappear from view. The utility pole on the right side of the frame grows larger, moving progressively closer to the center as the viewer passes it. Meanwhile, the white car on the far left of the street drives further away, and pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue walking into the distance.

The first frame depicts a city sidewalk scene looking down a street on a sunny day. In the immediate right foreground, a thick dark pole partially obscures a modern building with a glass facade and an awning. To the left, a sidewalk runs parallel to a street with a blue fire hydrant, a white car, and a traffic light pole displaying a green light and a pedestrian crossing signal. Bare trees line the far sidewalk, and distant buildings are visible under a blue sky.

end of description

The dark pole in the immediate right foreground progressively moves out of the frame to the right, revealing a man leaning against the building and more of its facade. Concurrently, a pedestrian walks forward from the mid-distance on the sidewalk towards the viewer. A dark car enters the frame from the left and moves towards the viewer, while the initial white car recedes further down the street to the left.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a paved city sidewalk is in the foreground, with a woman walking towards the viewer on the right, holding a white bag and an item. To her right is a modern building with a glass entrance displaying "EYES INSPIRE" and a large black planter, while to her left, a blue fire hydrant with a white top sits near the curb. A street stretches into the distance on the left, lined with bare trees, parked cars, a chained bicycle, and a traffic light showing green.
end of description
The woman proceeds to walk past the viewer, moving towards the right side of the frame, revealing her white bag has a checkered pattern. Concurrently, a dark bus gradually moves into the mid-left of the street, passing the fire hydrant and continuing past the viewer from left to right.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a city sidewalk scene shows a blue fire hydrant and a bare-branched tree in the foreground left, beside a parked dark bus with two bicycles chained to a trash can. A wide concrete sidewalk extends towards the background right, flanked by tall modern buildings, including one with "EYES INSPIRE" and a "FREE VISION EXAM" sign. Further down the street on the left, older buildings are visible under an overcast sky.
end of description
Subsequently, the bus on the left begins moving away from the viewer, gradually exiting the frame to the far left and revealing more of the empty street and sidewalk it was previously occupying.
