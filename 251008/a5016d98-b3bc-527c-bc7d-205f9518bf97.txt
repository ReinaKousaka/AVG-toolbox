The first frame displays a tranquil pond with lily pads and a winding wooden boardwalk in the midground, partially framed by a dark wooden log fence in the bottom right foreground and dense green leaves from trees at the top left and right. A paved path curves along the pond's left edge, while tall, light-colored apartment buildings stand against a cloudy sky in the background, separated by a band of green trees and distant mountains.

Subsequently, the view slowly pans to the left, causing the foreground wooden fence and the large leafy tree in the top right to gradually move out of the frame towards the right. This reveals more of the paved path, the left expanse of the pond, and additional apartment buildings to the far left in the background, as new foliage and a slender tree emerge on the far left side of the scene.
