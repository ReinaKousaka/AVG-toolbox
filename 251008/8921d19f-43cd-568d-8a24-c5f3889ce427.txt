In the first frame, a busy London street at night is visible, dominated by people in the foreground and midground. Prominent, brightly lit classical buildings line both sides of the street, with an iconic red and blue 'UNDERGROUND' sign marking an entrance in the central midground. Several individuals occupy the foreground; notably, a man in a dark jacket is to the far left, and a man and woman on the right hold phones up as if taking pictures.

Throughout the following frames, the bustling crowd exhibits dynamic changes, with individuals in the foreground and midground subtly shifting their positions and walking further into or out of the scene relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The man on the far left and those with their backs to the viewer in the central foreground show minor positional alterations, while the architectural background remains stationary.
