The first frame shows a night city street scene. In the immediate foreground, a person in a grey puffer jacket and a blue and yellow bobble hat is partially visible on the right, facing towards the right. A white SUV with illuminated headlights is in the midground, center-right, driving away from the viewer. The street extends into the distance, filled with traffic showing red taillights and distant headlights. To the left, a sidewalk runs parallel to the viewer, bordered by ornate, historical buildings lit with festive decorations, a streetlamp, and a black A-frame sign; pedestrians are visible further along this sidewalk. To the right, another sidewalk with modern, glass-fronted buildings features parked cars, bicycles, and pedestrians. The dark night sky is visible above.

The person in the foreground moves completely out of view to the right, fully revealing the street and buildings beyond them. The white SUV and other vehicles continue to drive away from the viewer down the street. Pedestrians on both sidewalks also continue to move further along the street. The scene consistently maintains the same first-frame viewpoint, with dynamic elements continually moving forward within the established street perspective.

The first frame depicts a nighttime city street with a paved sidewalk and a building adorned with decorative lights on the left, where a black display stand stands in the foreground. To the right, a multi-story modern building with large windows overlooks a road with parked cars and a white arrow pointing away from the viewer, while two pedestrians walk on the left sidewalk towards the viewer.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the two pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue walking towards the viewer, steadily advancing past the black display stand. Concurrently, a third pedestrian enters the frame from the far left foreground, moving to the right, behind the display stand.

The first frame depicts a nighttime street scene. In the foreground left, a man and a woman walk away from the viewer on a paved sidewalk, casting shadows, adjacent to buildings that line the left side of the street, including a "Five Guys" restaurant. To the right, parked cars line the street, extending towards the background where other vehicles are in motion on the road, illuminated by streetlights and the lights of distant buildings under a dark sky.
end of description
Subsequently, the man and woman continue walking away from the viewer on the left sidewalk, eventually moving out of the frame entirely to the left. A new individual in a dark coat then enters the frame from the far left, walking towards the viewer on the same sidewalk, gradually moving across the lower left foreground of the scene. Meanwhile, vehicles in the mid-distance on the road exhibit slight forward movement, progressing further down the street away from the viewer.
