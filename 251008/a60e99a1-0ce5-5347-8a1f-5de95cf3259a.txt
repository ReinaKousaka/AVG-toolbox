The viewer is positioned at street level, looking down a rain-soaked city street at night. In the foreground, the reddish-brown pavement is covered in puddles, reflecting vibrant lights from surrounding buildings. In the midground, numerous pedestrians with umbrellas are crossing the street, flanked by multi-story buildings with illuminated storefronts (e.g., "Gong Cha" on the left) and a large tree on the right. In the background, more towering buildings with various glowing signs (including a prominent green one) stretch into the dark night sky.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the reflection of a traffic light on the wet ground in the midground dynamically shifts from green to a vivid blue/purple, then to yellow/orange, and back to green, indicating a change in signal. Pedestrians continue to move across the street in the midground, with some entering from the left and others exiting to the right. A dark vehicle briefly appears from the right in the midground, moving leftwards across the street before passing out of view. The reflections on the puddles subtly ripple, maintaining the sense of continuous rainfall.

The first frame depicts a wet city street at night, with a reddish-brown pavement in the foreground reflecting vibrant neon and building lights. Numerous pedestrians with umbrellas are visible in the mid-ground, positioned between brightly lit buildings to the left and right, and a red traffic light stands in the center-left.

Subsequently, the prominent light reflections on the wet mid-ground pavement dynamically shift from green-blue to purple, then back to green, mirroring ambient light changes. Concurrently, pedestrians holding umbrellas in the mid-ground begin to traverse the intersection from left to right, while a new person enters the far left foreground. Slight shifts in vehicle positions also occur, demonstrating ongoing activity on the street.
