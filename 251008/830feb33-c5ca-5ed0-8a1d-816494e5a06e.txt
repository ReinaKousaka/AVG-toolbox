The first frame displays a wet, patterned sidewalk extending into the distance, bordered on the left by evergreen shrubs in wooden planters in front of a building labeled "TWIN TREE A", and on the right by a utility box featuring an LG air conditioner, with a rainy street and distant car headlights visible in the background.

Subsequently, a yellow cable covered by black ramps is revealed on the sidewalk, stretching across the midground from left to right. Two individuals in high-visibility vests emerge from behind the leftmost planters, moving briefly into view before receding. The camera then subtly pans right and slightly pulls back, widening the view of the rainy street and diminishing the details of the right-side utility box.

In the first frame, a wet, tiled sidewalk stretches into the midground from the viewer's lower center. To the viewer's left, large green potted plants in reddish-brown planters line the sidewalk, with a white fence-like structure behind them and a glass-facade building further back. To the right, a low green hedge runs alongside the sidewalk, and a streetlamp stands further down, casting light on the wet ground which reflects green traffic lights and distant building lights from the street in the background. A light-colored vertical structure partially obscures the far right foreground.

Subsequently, a large white truck with a red back gradually becomes visible in the distant background, moving from the viewer's right to left on the wet road. As the truck continues to move across the background, the camera subtly pans slightly to the right, slightly expanding the view of the background structures and trees on the right.

The first frame presents a wet city street scene at night, viewed from a geometrically patterned sidewalk. To the viewer's immediate left, large potted green bushes line the path, mirrored by smaller hedges on the right, both leading towards the midground. A streetlight illuminates a bare tree and a distant green traffic light on the wet street, with city buildings visible under a dark, rainy sky in the background.

A white van gradually appears from the right, traversing the distant street from right to left. The rain visibly intensifies across the entire scene, manifesting as numerous bright streaks, especially under the streetlight, and causing circular light distortions in the upper frame. The van then exits the scene as the heavy rainfall continues.
