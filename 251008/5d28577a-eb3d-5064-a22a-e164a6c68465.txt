Two large, ornate glass chandeliers hang prominently in the upper central and right foreground, illuminating a modern kitchen to the left with white cabinets, a hexagonal tile backsplash, a stove, and a sink; an island is partially visible in the immediate foreground. Further back on the right, a dining table with chairs sits near a large window, beyond which an outdoor patio and, further left, a room with a pool table are visible.

The camera slowly pans right and slightly upwards. The left chandelier gradually moves out of frame while the right chandelier shifts to the upper center, revealing a wide-open area to the right. A large, bright blue swimming pool and extensive outdoor landscaping become prominent outside the expansive windows, altering the spatial relationship to the original dining area which now appears more to the left, and new high windows become visible on the far right wall.
