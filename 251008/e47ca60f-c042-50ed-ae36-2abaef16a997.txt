The first frame displays a wet city street during rainfall. In the foreground to the left, a bicycle wheel is partially visible. Further back on the left, a grey delivery truck is parked next to a yellow barrier with red poles, and several grey utility boxes. A wet sidewalk extends into the distance, bordered by trees and a row of storefronts on the right, featuring a prominent yellow banner with "10,900" and other illuminated signs. Buildings rise in the background under an overcast sky.

Rain continues to fall throughout the frames. From the sixth frame onwards, a person holding a white umbrella enters from the immediate right of the viewer, walking along the sidewalk away from the camera. Simultaneously, the edge of a black umbrella appears in the top right foreground, presumably held by the viewer. The person with the white umbrella continues to move further into the mid-ground along the street.

From the perspective of someone under a black umbrella, a rainy city street stretches forward. On the right, a woman with short dark hair, wearing a dark outfit and carrying a brown bag, walks away from the viewer under a white umbrella, passing a yellow structure and storefronts with red Korean signage. To the left, several large grey utility boxes and a white truck are visible, lining the wet sidewalk which is flanked by trees and tall buildings under an overcast sky.
end of description
The woman with the white umbrella continuously moves further away from the viewer along the sidewalk. As she progresses, the initial foreground objects on the right (yellow structure, tarp-covered item) exit the frame to the right, and the grey utility boxes on the left recede, then disappear from the frame left. New storefronts, including a 'Subway' sign, become visible further down the street on the right. Towards the end, another person holding a black umbrella appears much further ahead on the street, also moving away from the original viewpoint.

The first frame captures a rainy street with a large grey utility box in the immediate foreground left. A woman holding a white umbrella walks away from the viewer down a wet sidewalk, flanked by a covered scooter on the left and various storefronts, including a Subway, on the right. In the background, a street with cars and distant buildings is visible under an overcast sky.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the woman with the white umbrella continues to walk further away from the viewer down the sidewalk. Simultaneously, another person holding a black umbrella, initially seen near the storefronts on the right, also progresses further down the street.
