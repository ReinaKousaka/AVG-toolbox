To the right, a large tree trunk partially obscures the view, with a person seated on a teal bench below, facing a street where a white car is parked further down amid other buildings and trees.

A brown sedan appears on the street to the center-left of the first-frame viewpoint and drives away, while the man on the bench moves out of the frame to the right. The initial silver SUV and the brown sedan depart from the scene, moving away to the right. Subsequently, a black sedan and then a white SUV emerge from behind the first-frame viewpoint and drive away to the right on the street. Lastly, another silver car enters from behind the first-frame viewpoint, also proceeding away to the right on the street.

In the first frame, a street scene unfolds under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left, a reddish-brown tiled area with a short green metal railing and manicured green hedges leads to a cluster of palm trees and lush green foliage. A light-colored sidewalk extends from the foreground right, featuring a green waste bin near a tree trunk, and beyond it, green bushes and a tall, teal-colored decorative structure. In the midground, a street crosses horizontally, where a white SUV is visible on the right, partially obscured, and a silver sedan is positioned behind it to the left, both stopped near beige bollards. A traffic light displaying red is visible further down the street in the mid-distance, and buildings line both sides of the street, including a reddish-brown one on the left and a taller, lighter-colored building on the far right.
end of description
The white SUV and silver sedan, initially on the street in the midground to the right of center, begin to move forward and rightwards. The white SUV exits the frame to the right. A dark-colored car then enters the midground from the left side of the street, driving rightwards across the intersection. Simultaneously, the silver sedan continues its movement rightward and eventually exits the frame to the right.

The viewer is at a street corner looking forward, with lush green foliage, a palm tree trunk, and an orange railing on the immediate left. A reddish-brown sidewalk, featuring two concrete bollards, extends towards a street in the mid-ground, where a dark grey car is moving from right to left across the intersection. To the far right, a tall teal-green rectangular structure stands, while a terracotta-colored building is on the mid-ground left and a large beige building with multiple windows is on the mid-ground right.
end of description
The dark grey car drives further left across the street, exiting the frame. Subsequently, a white compact car enters from the right and moves left across the intersection. Following this, a white van appears from the right, also proceeding left across the intersection in the mid-ground.

In the first frame, a white van with a yellow logo is driving left across an intersection at the center of the view, with green foliage, a brick church, and a large bare tree positioned to the viewer's left. To the right, a multi-story building stands behind a green decorative archway, and two light-colored bollards are visible on the foreground sidewalk. Traffic lights appear on both sides of the intersection under a sunny sky.
end of description
The white van continues moving left across the intersection, gradually revealing more of a building with "THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH" sign in the midground. After the van completely exits the frame to the left, a white SUV enters from the right and proceeds to cross the now-clear intersection in the same direction.

The midground features a wide street with a white SUV to the right, a large brick building with a prominent tree to the left, and a multi-story building lining the right side. In the center, a tall white pole and traffic lights showing red are visible.
end of description
A man on a bicycle enters from the far left of the foreground, riding towards the right across the intersection. Simultaneously, the white SUV on the right proceeds forward, gradually moving out of the frame to the right. As the cyclist moves towards the middle-right, a red car emerges from the left street and stops at the intersection, occupying the mid-left area where the white SUV was previously visible. The cyclist continues his path towards the right, eventually exiting the frame.
