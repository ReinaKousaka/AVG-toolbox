The initial frame presents a city street with a prominent, multi-story brown building featuring a Mexican flag on the left and center. In the foreground, a white car's front is at bottom-left, while a red sedan, a white-and-pink taxi, and a scooter with a rider move away on the road, flanked by pedestrians on both sidewalks.

As the viewpoint moves forward and slightly right, the foreground white car exits left, an orange barrier appears bottom-left, and the central red sedan, taxi, and scooter move further right and out of frame. The large brown building becomes more central, revealing clearer crosswalk markings and a red "Official Tour" bus sign further right on the street as elements pass.
