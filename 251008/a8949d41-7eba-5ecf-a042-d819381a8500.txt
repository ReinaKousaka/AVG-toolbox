In the first frame, a multi-lane road curves right with a prominent yellow-striped crosswalk and a red paved area on the left in the foreground. A streetlamp with directional signs stands to the left, while a blue pedestrian sign and another streetlamp are visible further ahead amidst dense green trees on the right and distant mountains under a bright sun in a blue sky to the left.
end of description
As the viewer progresses, the crosswalk, the first streetlamp, and the blue pedestrian sign all recede behind and to the left of the original viewpoint. The road ahead continuously unfolds, revealing new sections of pavement and lane markings, while the tree-lined slope on the right and distant mountains maintain their relative positions.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows the viewer on a road that forks, marked with white arrows and triangular dashes on the asphalt, under a clear blue sky with a bright sun in the upper left. To the left, a dark barrier curves alongside the road, backed by hazy mountains in the distance. To the right, a signpost with directional information stands amidst dense green foliage that lines the road and ascends a hillside.

end of description

As the sequence progresses, the camera moves forward along the right-hand road. The road markings directly in front of the viewer and the railing to the left pass towards and then behind the viewer's initial position. The signpost and associated signs, initially to the mid-right, progressively move further to the right and slightly behind the first-frame viewpoint, revealing a circular '70' speed limit sign alongside a streetlight that also passes the viewer. The dense green foliage on the right side also moves closer and begins to curve, starting to obscure the path further along the first-frame's right edge.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows the viewer on a paved road, looking forward towards a slight right curve. To the left, a multi-lane highway with a guardrail runs parallel, featuring distant mountains beneath a bright sun, while to the right, dense green bushes and trees line a grassy verge, with a streetlamp and a '60' speed limit sign prominently positioned.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward: the streetlamp and speed limit sign on the right side of the road steadily move towards and then out of the right edge of the frame. Simultaneously, the road markings on the ground pass beneath the viewer, and a dark tunnel entrance gradually becomes more visible and prominent straight ahead in the mid-distance.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The viewpoint looks down a winding road, marked with white lines and arrows in the foreground, leading towards a dark tunnel entrance in the mid-ground, slightly right of center. To the left, a metal guardrail parallels the road, while dense green foliage covers a hillside to the right and extends around the tunnel; a bright sun shines in the upper-left of the clear blue sky, with distant mountains faintly visible on the left horizon, and two black streetlights positioned along the road.
end of description
The scene progresses with the viewer moving forward along the road towards the tunnel. The initial white road markings and the foreground streetlight gradually move left and out of view, while the tunnel entrance gets progressively larger and closer. Simultaneously, a concrete wall and metal fence emerge on the right side, directly adjacent to the approaching tunnel, which were previously unseen from the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents an asphalt road with white markings leading towards a dark tunnel entrance directly ahead. To the left, a guardrail parallels the road, backed by green trees on a rising slope, while a concrete retaining wall with a metal fence runs along the right side. A tall street light pole stands in the center, slightly left of the tunnel, and the bright sun is visible in the upper-left sky above.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the tunnel entrance grows larger, approaching the viewer. The street light pole shifts to the left and upwards, eventually moving out of view, and the sun becomes obscured by the tunnel's structure. Upon entering, the scene darkens considerably, and the tunnel's interior lights and a small, bright opening at its far end, directly ahead of the viewer, become visible.
