In the first frame, two pedestrians dominate the foreground, viewed from behind as they walk away from the viewer: a man in a peach shirt carrying a blue bag on the right, and a woman with a patterned handbag on the left. To the immediate left, a dark construction barrier with a security camera and a door runs along the sidewalk. To the right, a blue city bus with an advertisement and "MTA" branding is parked next to a street light pole adorned with a hanging flower basket. Further down the street, numerous other pedestrians walk, and tall city buildings line the urban street.

As the frames progress, the foreground man and woman continue walking further away from the viewer. The blue city bus on the right also moves forward, gradually revealing its full length, including an American flag decal on its rear side. Simultaneously, more pedestrians appear from the far left of the first-frame viewpoint and walk away, while orange construction barrels become visible on the sidewalk in the mid-distance to the right.

In the first frame, the viewer is on a city sidewalk, looking forward at the backs of three pedestrians: one with long dark hair and a patterned shirt, another in a peach shirt and black shorts carrying a blue bag, and a third partially visible to the far left. To the immediate left is a dark construction barrier marked "VORNADO", while to the right is a street with a blue New York City bus moving away and two orange and white construction barrels on the sidewalk. In the background, buildings line both sides of the street, including one with a curved roof to the far left, under an overcast sky.

As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the sidewalk, causing the street on the right to reveal more orange and white construction barriers extending into the midground. The blue bus moves further away to the right, while a black SUV and a white van appear from behind the first construction barrels and drive forward on the street to the right of the viewer. Simultaneously, the construction barrier to the viewer's left reveals more text, "REALTY TRUST" and "ELEVATE YOUR CONTENT", as the street ahead reveals more pedestrians and distant city buildings.

In the first frame, the back of a person wearing a white and brown patterned top is central in the foreground, with another person holding a blue bag to their left, and two more individuals walking ahead on the sidewalk. To the far left, a dark construction barrier with "ELEVATE YOUR TALENT" text stretches along the sidewalk. To the right, red and white striped construction barriers with orange cones line a street, where a white van is driving towards the right, and tall city buildings rise on the far right. In the background to the left, a large building with circular elements is visible.

As the video progresses, the viewpoint subtly moves forward. The pedestrians in the foreground and midground continue walking away, revealing more of the street ahead. The white van on the right exits the frame, while a dark grey minivan and a yellow SUV, initially further back on the street, advance towards the right. The construction barriers to the viewer's right and the dark wall on the left recede, displaying more of the street's depth and buildings further down the block.
