The first frame displays a street scene under an overcast sky. In the foreground, a grey asphalt road with a yellow double line runs centrally, leading into the distance. Directly ahead of the viewer is a white SUV with its brake lights illuminated. To its immediate left, a black SUV is moving away from the viewer, while further left, another black SUV is visible near the curb. On the right, a grey van and a white SUV are parked alongside a multi-story building featuring large windows, various signs with Chinese and Tibetan script, and red ornamental elements along its roofline. Similar buildings, adorned with red lanterns, line the left side of the street, extending towards distant mountains visible beneath the cloudy sky.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the white SUV directly ahead of the viewer remains largely stationary, though its brake lights flicker on and off. The black SUV to its left slowly moves forward and slightly left, revealing more of a white minivan behind it further down the street. On the right, a white scooter newly appears parked in front of the white SUV, and a white sedan also parks behind the white SUV as the sequence progresses.

The first frame shows a street scene looking forward along a paved road flanked by multi-story buildings featuring traditional Tibetan architecture and adorned with red banners and Chinese flags. A black SUV is partially visible in the lower-left foreground, and a white SUV is centered further ahead on the road. Cars are parked along both sides of the road, with a blue barrier present on the left side in the mid-ground, and distant mountains are visible under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective subtly shifts forward. The black SUV in the lower-left foreground moves past the viewer and exits the frame to the left. The white SUV in the central foreground continues ahead, maintaining its relative position to the viewer. A motorcycle with a rider emerges from behind the blue barrier on the left side of the road, moving forward towards the distant background and passing the white SUV. The buildings and parked cars along the sides of the road appear to subtly shift wider relative to the center as the viewpoint advances.

First, a paved road extends forward from the viewer, with a white SUV ahead and centered in the lane. To the right, parked vehicles like a black SUV and a red Jeep line the street, while to the left, a blue construction barrier and a motorcycle are visible behind it. Buildings with traditional architecture adorn both sides of the street, displaying flags and banners, with mountains and an overcast sky in the distant background.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the white SUV ahead and parked cars on the right recede further into the midground, while the motorcycle and blue barrier on the left also shift away. Concurrently, new segments of buildings and additional vehicles further down the street become continuously visible ahead.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a street lined with multi-story buildings featuring traditional architecture and red lanterns on both sides, leading towards distant mountains under a cloudy sky. In the foreground, blue construction barriers occupy the left, a dark sedan and other vehicles are parked on the right, and a white SUV is directly ahead on the road.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewer moves forward along the road. The blue barriers on the left slowly exit the frame, revealing additional parked cars in that area. Concurrently, the parked dark sedan on the right moves out of view, with a white SUV becoming fully visible before it too passes, indicating continuous movement through the traffic.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a street scene with a road extending from the foreground into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings of traditional Tibetan architecture on both the left and right sides. Red banners and lanterns adorn these buildings, with utility poles and power lines visible along the right side overhead. In the far background, mountains rise under an overcast sky. A white SUV is directly ahead of the viewer on the road, with other vehicles further down; a white sedan and a silver SUV are in the left lane, while several cars, including a silver and a white SUV, are parked along the right curb. Red traffic cones and a blue banner are partially visible in the bottom left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves slowly forward along the street. The white SUV directly ahead turns off its brake lights briefly around frame 4-5 before they illuminate again in frame 8. The white sedan in the adjacent left lane gradually advances, moving closer to the viewer. Simultaneously, a beige/gold SUV on the far right slowly enters the frame from the right edge, becoming increasingly visible as the parked vehicles on the right side of the road recede from view due to the forward motion.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a multi-lane paved road recedes into the distance, flanked by rows of multi-story buildings adorned with red flags and lanterns under an overcast sky. A silver Lexus SUV occupies the left foreground, followed by a white SUV with a blue license plate centrally positioned further ahead, while various cars are parked along both curbs. Mountains are visible in the distant background.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the silver Lexus SUV on the left, and the white SUV ahead, proceed further into the distance. The white car initially partially visible on the far left gradually moves out of frame, revealing more of the Lexus's side. Simultaneously, the silver SUV on the far right exits the frame, bringing the white sedan and a person on a red moped on the right side closer and more clearly into view, with the moped visibly advancing. The buildings lining the street become progressively closer and more detailed as the perspective shifts forward.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a straight-on view of a multi-lane road flanked by traditional-style buildings with red flags under a cloudy sky, leading towards distant mountains. In the foreground and midground, a white SUV and a silver SUV are in the road ahead, while numerous cars are parked along the curbs on both the left and right sides, with a person on a red scooter visible on the far right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The white and silver SUVs ahead drive further down the road relative to the first-frame viewpoint, increasing their distance. Simultaneously, parked vehicles previously further down the street are revealed closer to the viewer's current position, effectively moving towards the initial viewpoint, with the scooter and its rider passing out of view to the right of the first-frame position.
