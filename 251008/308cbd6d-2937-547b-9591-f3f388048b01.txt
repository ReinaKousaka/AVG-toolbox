The first frame captures a rainy street scene featuring a wet, reflective sidewalk leading into a covered walkway, with a couple under a blue umbrella and several other individuals with dark umbrellas walking away from the viewer in the midground, alongside a metallic wall with red reflections on the right and a newsstand and red SUV visible to the far left.

As the sequence progresses, the initial couple and other foreground pedestrians progressively move into the background and out of frame, revealing more of the wet sidewalk that was closer to the viewer. Simultaneously, new people appear from the foreground, also walking away from the viewer under umbrellas, as the red SUV on the left continues to recede further into the background.
