In the first frame, two outdoor dining tables with chairs are in the foreground, one dark-topped on the left and a lighter-topped one on the right. A woman in a polka-dot dress stands right of center, facing left, gesturing, while a man in a black shirt stands behind her in the doorway of a brick building adorned with plants and purple flowers, occupying the left midground. To the right, a cobblestone street recedes into the background, where three pedestrians walk away from the viewer, flanked by old brick buildings and topped by a yellow and green flag.

As the frames progress, the group of three pedestrians on the cobblestone street, to the right and further from the viewer, continues to walk away, becoming smaller and more distant. The man standing in the restaurant doorway and the woman conversing in front remain largely stationary, with only subtle shifts in the woman's arm movements. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the perspective and setting remain consistent.
