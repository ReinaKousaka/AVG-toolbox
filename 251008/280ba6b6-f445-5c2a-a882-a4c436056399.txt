The first frame depicts a city sidewalk scene. In the immediate foreground to the right, a black and green electric scooter stands upright, partially obscuring a low green hedge and the lower part of a light-colored brick building behind it. To the left, a black Toyota sedan is parked on the street. Across the street, other vehicles are visible, and several trees with green foliage line the street and sidewalk. In the mid-ground, distant pedestrians walk on the far sidewalk, and buildings extend into the background under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the electric scooter, initially in the foreground to the right, progressively moves further to the right and eventually exits the frame. This movement gradually reveals more of the green hedge and the base of the building that were initially behind the scooter's position. Concurrently, a small orange cone becomes fully visible on the sidewalk in the mid-ground, slightly to the right of the center, having been partially hidden by the scooter earlier.

In the first frame, a black car is partially visible in the immediate foreground to the left. To the right, a green hedge on a brick wall obscures part of a white SUV parked next to a multi-story building with beige walls and dark-framed windows. A sidewalk extends into the midground, bordered by trees on the left; beneath one, a person is seated on the ground, with another person further down the sidewalk closer to the building. Across the street, a crosswalk is visible, with a black car parked further down the street, and buildings with storefronts on the far left.
end of description.
Subsequent frames show only very subtle movements in the leaves of the trees in the midground, suggesting a light breeze. All other visible objects, including the parked cars, buildings, and people on the sidewalk, remain static relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows the viewer on a sidewalk beside a multistory brick building on the right, where a white SUV is partially visible behind a green hedge. To the left, a street with a crosswalk stretches towards other buildings, and in the mid-ground, a person sits near a tree by a parked black car and a bicycle. end of description
The white SUV on the right side of the frames gradually moves backward relative to the viewer's initial position, revealing more of its rear and side. Simultaneously, the green hedge in the immediate foreground on the right also recedes, further exposing the SUV. All other elements in the scene remain stationary.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a city street with a tan brick building on the right, partially obscuring a silver SUV in the foreground. A sidewalk runs down the left, featuring two trees, a person seated with belongings including a blue tarp and bicycle, and a black car parked behind them on the adjacent street. Further down the street to the left, an intersection with crosswalks and another building are visible, while pedestrians and more vehicles populate the street extending into the distance.
end of description
In subsequent frames, a black car initially visible further down the street to the right moves forward and eventually exits the scene. Subsequently, a white pickup truck enters from the right and proceeds further down the street, followed by another silver vehicle.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a street scene from a sidewalk, with a light brick building on the viewer's right and two prominent trees to the left. An intersection with crosswalks is visible ahead and to the left, featuring a parked dark sedan, a wheelchair, and belongings on the sidewalk, while a white pickup truck is further down the street. end of description. Subsequently, a dark SUV appears on the far left and progresses slowly through the intersection. Later, a light-colored sedan emerges from the right side of the street, driving across the intersection towards the left and eventually out of view, while the white pickup truck also advances forward.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a street-level view of a city sidewalk looking towards an intersection. To the viewer's left, a large tree trunk stands, with an orange traffic cone barrier nearby. A black car is parked on the street parallel to the sidewalk, behind the cone. On the sidewalk next to the car, a person is crouched, facing away from the viewer, surrounded by a blue wheelchair and belongings including a blue tarp and scattered papers. To the right, a tan brick building with large windows extends into the distance, featuring a distinct dark bay window structure overhead. In the background, an intersection with a crosswalk is visible, lined with further buildings and trees under a bright sky.
end of description
The person on the sidewalk gradually shifts posture over several frames. Initially crouched and facing away from the viewer, they slowly move their position. By the sixth frame, this individual is seen lying down on the sidewalk, mostly covered by blue fabric, with the wheelchair and belongings remaining next to them to the left. No new objects are revealed, and the surrounding street and buildings remain static relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a street scene from the perspective of someone standing on a sidewalk. To the viewer's right, a multi-story brick building with several large windows lines the sidewalk, with an orange and white traffic cone standing upright on the sidewalk in the lower right, and a black bag further up. To the viewer's left, a large tree grows from the sidewalk, and underneath it, a person is lying on the ground, partially covered by a blue tarp, with a wheelchair-like object beside them. A black car is parked on the street to the left, adjacent to the sidewalk, and a white crosswalk extends across the street ahead of the viewer, with distant buildings and traffic visible beyond.
end of description
Starting from the fourth frame, a "NO LOITERING" sign becomes visible in a window on the building to the viewer's right. Concurrently, the person lying on the sidewalk near the tree, to the viewer's left, slowly shifts their position, increasingly obscuring themselves under the blue tarp and moving partially out of the lower-left frame by the seventh frame. By the eighth frame, the person is almost entirely gone, and simultaneously, the orange and white traffic cone on the sidewalk to the viewer's immediate right falls over horizontally. The person fully exits the frame in the ninth image, leaving only a small portion of the blue tarp visible at the very bottom left.
