The street and buildings extend into the distance on the left, paralleled by a shop-lined sidewalk on the right, with another person visible further down.
end of description
The elderly man proceeds away from the viewer and left, his movement revealing the full trash can and the growing pile of white bags beside it, which were initially mostly behind him relative to the first-frame viewpoint. He then continues walking off-screen to the far left, leaving an unobstructed view of the street ahead as the person further down the sidewalk also moves slightly away.

The first frame reveals a sunny urban street scene with a pile of garbage bags and a cardboard box in the immediate foreground to the viewer's left, beside a green street sign. A person stands further ahead on the left sidewalk, which parallels a multi-lane road with cars, while buildings with windowed facades line the right sidewalk.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward and slightly right along the sidewalk, the foreground pile of garbage and the green street sign, originally on the viewer's immediate left, move out of frame to the *left and behind* the advancing camera's current field of view. The person, initially in the mid-ground on the left sidewalk relative to the first-frame viewpoint, appears to move *closer* to the viewer as the scene advances, while the buildings on both sides become more prominent and reveal deeper sections of the street ahead.

The first frame presents a sunny urban street scene. In the immediate foreground, the left side shows the head and shoulder of a person. To the left, a grey car is parked on a multi-lane street, with other vehicles and tall buildings receding into the distance. Centered in the mid-ground, a lamppost with red and white banners stands, casting a long shadow on the sidewalk. On the right side, a busy sidewalk features pedestrians, street vendors with carts, and storefronts, with more buildings extending into the background under a clear blue sky.

end of description

The person initially in the foreground left moves out of view. The grey car on the left side of the street begins driving forward, away from the first-frame viewpoint. Subsequently, a white van and then a dark sedan appear from behind the grey car's initial position, also moving forward along the left side of the street past the original viewpoint. Pedestrians on the right sidewalk continue to move further down the street away from the viewer.
