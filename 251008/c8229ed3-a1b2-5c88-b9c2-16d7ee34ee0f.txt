In the first frame, a man wearing a grey shirt and shorts stands on a gravel path on the right, facing left. To his left, behind a wooden fence, an outdoor dining area with white patio umbrellas, seated patrons, and potted plants is visible, all shaded by a large tree. In the background, rolling, vineyard-covered hills and a distant body of water are seen under a light sky.

The man then walks from right to left across the foreground. As he progresses, a paved path and several people walking further into the midground-background are revealed to the far right of his initial position, beyond a green hedge and beside a stone ruin.
