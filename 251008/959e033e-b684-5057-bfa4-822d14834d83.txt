The first frame depicts a wet city street at night, looking down a thoroughfare lined with buildings; to the left, a classical-style building stands adjacent to a tall modern high-rise featuring prominent blue lighting on its lower floors, while in the midground, numerous vehicles including yellow taxis and dark cars are positioned on the reflective street moving away from the viewer, bordered on the right by a sidewalk with a row of metal bollards and an imposing dark, curved overhead structure.
end of description
Traffic slowly advances away from the viewer, with vehicles further down the street also progressing forward from their initial positions. A subtle upward and rightward camera pan gradually reveals slightly more of the upper portions of the tall buildings and the dark overhead structure on the far right, exposing more of the dim, overcast sky previously obscured. The vibrant reflections from the streetlights and vehicle lights on the wet pavement consistently shift and stretch with the movement, maintaining the scene's dynamic, rainy night atmosphere.
