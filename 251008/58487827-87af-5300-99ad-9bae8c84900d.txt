The first frame shows a view down a two-lane road that gently curves left and descends into a small village, flanked by a steep, tree-covered grassy bank with houses on the left and a guardrail with trees and a light-colored fence on the right, under a partly cloudy blue sky.

As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the initial light-colored fence on the right exits the frame, revealing more trees beyond the guardrail. Simultaneously, a stone retaining wall on the left bank becomes more visible below the existing trees. Further progression unveils two streetlamp poles that emerge from the left side of the road, becoming more central and prominent as the village ahead draws closer.
