In the first frame, a person wearing a plaid shirt and dark pants with a backpack stands on a grey hexagonal-tiled path, facing away from the viewer and slightly to the right. To the viewer's immediate right, a bed of lush green plants with large leaves and a shorter grassy area is bordered by a low black decorative fence. In the midground, several dark park benches line the path on the left, while further to the right, numerous people are seated on benches beneath a large, old tree with substantial branches, and more foliage extends into the background.

The person in the foreground subtly shifts their weight and adjusts their stance throughout the frames. In the midground, individuals seated on benches occasionally move, and distant figures on the path to the left also exhibit minor movements. The foliage, particularly on the right side, shows slight rustling, suggesting a gentle breeze.
