In the first frame, the viewer is on a paved pathway looking forward. To the immediate right, a large yellow vertical signboard with Korean text and images stands partially visible. Behind and to the right of this signboard, a row of illuminated storefronts with glass doors lines a building extending into the distance. To the left, a tall white construction barrier runs parallel to the pathway, topped by a blue mesh fence. Several pedestrians are visible walking in the distance, ahead on the path between the barrier and the storefronts, beneath a pale sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the yellow signboard on the right moves out of frame, revealing more of the storefronts including new sections of their facades and entrances. The white barrier on the left also moves past, and a red horizontal light strip becomes visible along its length, starting mid-frame and extending further away from the original viewpoint. The distant pedestrians gradually move closer before eventually exiting the frame ahead.

A narrow pedestrian path extends from the viewer into the distance, flanked by a tall white construction barrier on the left and a row of illuminated storefronts on the right. The barrier, reflecting a blue sky and distant buildings, has a horizontal red safety light strip. On the right, stores like 'U+ SQUARE' and 'L'BRAUN' display various items behind glass, with the nearest store featuring a light-colored ramp. Several masked pedestrians walk away from the viewer in the middle ground of the path, leading towards a distant street with buildings and a red traffic light under a clear sky.

end of description

The camera gradually moves forward along the path. The white construction barrier on the viewer's left in the first frame subtly shifts further left and recedes into the distance, while the storefronts on the right reveal slightly more of their facades as the viewer progresses. The group of pedestrians in the middle ground appears marginally closer and larger relative to the advancing viewpoint. Consequently, the distant street, traffic light, and buildings in the background also become progressively nearer and slightly larger in the frame.

The first frame depicts an urban sidewalk scene at dusk or dawn. To the viewer's left, a tall white construction hoarding with a red light strip along its base extends into the distance, topped by a blue tarp. To the viewer's right, a multi-story building features several brightly lit shopfronts with Korean signage, including a prominent "U+" store in the immediate foreground, stretching into the background. A narrow pathway separates these structures, occupied by several masked pedestrians in winter coats walking towards the viewer, with two women in the midground being most noticeable. In the distant background, a street with traffic lights and other buildings is visible.

end of description
As the frames progress, the pedestrians, especially the two women initially in the midground, steadily advance towards the viewer along the sidewalk. These individuals move from the midground into the immediate foreground, eventually passing directly in front of the viewer's first-frame position. Other masked people previously further down the path also come into closer view, following the lead group. The overall scene subtly shifts, suggesting the viewer is either moving forward or the crowd is continuously flowing past.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, two masked women in winter coats are prominent in the left foreground, walking towards the viewer on a sidewalk. To their right, the sidewalk continues past multiple illuminated storefronts, including an LG U+ store, extending into the distance where more masked pedestrians walk. A long white construction barrier with a blue net above it lines the left side of the street, featuring a red laser line across its face, while taller buildings and a pale sky are visible in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk. The two foreground women pass the viewer and exit the frame to the left, while other masked pedestrians in the midground continue to walk both towards and away from the viewer. The storefronts on the right, including a "spacebaum" sign and a building entrance, become more detailed and closer as the scene advances. The construction barrier on the left maintains its presence, reflecting the onward movement.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a city sidewalk scene with a white construction barrier on the left extending towards the background and a building with pink-accented glass storefronts on the right. Several masked pedestrians walk towards the viewer on the central sidewalk, with further buildings and street signs visible in the distant background under a pale sky.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward; the closest two masked pedestrians, initially in the mid-ground, move towards and then past the viewer's left side. The construction barrier on the viewer's left and the storefront on the viewer's right appear to recede as the camera advances, revealing more of the street ahead relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a pedestrian's view on a city sidewalk, with a tall, light-colored construction barrier immediately to the left and a woman in a white coat walking away from the viewer further along the sidewalk. To the right, a modern storefront with pink-framed windows, a black awning, and illuminated neon signs is visible, elevated by steps, while numerous other masked pedestrians and distant city buildings with traffic are present further down the street.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the sidewalk, causing the construction barrier and the woman in the white coat on the left to gradually move out of frame. Simultaneously, the storefront on the right becomes increasingly prominent and detailed, revealing more of its vibrant pink doors and internal lighting. The other pedestrians continue walking ahead, receding into the distance as the street scene unfolds.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A woman in a dark coat and white mask walks toward the viewer on a sidewalk to the left, adjacent to a light-colored wall with a railing, while to the right, a storefront with a black awning and glass windows featuring pink neon signs is visible, with a street and distant city buildings ahead.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the woman on the left continues walking past the viewer, and the storefront on the right gradually reveals more interior details. The street ahead, with its traffic and other pedestrians, also grows closer and clearer.
