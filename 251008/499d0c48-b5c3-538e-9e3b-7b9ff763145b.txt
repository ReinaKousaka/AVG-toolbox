As the frames progress, the man in black continues moving further into the street's depth, away from the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the man in purple exits the frame to the right, as a woman in a yellow top and an older man with a cane emerge from the mid-ground right of the first-frame viewpoint, walking towards the viewer, enriching the market scene.

In subsequent frames, the man in black continues walking away, and the woman in yellow proceeds past the central vertical line towards the right, eventually exiting the frame. A new woman holding a white wrapped bouquet emerges from the far right of the frame, moving towards the viewer. Pedestrians in the background and mid-ground continuously shift, entering from the distance and exiting the sides, maintaining a dynamic street scene.
