A rain-soaked street extends from the viewer, flanked by parked cars on the left and dense trees with a dark gazebo on the right. In the foreground, a dark grey car is parked, followed by a darker sedan, both on the left, leading towards a white box truck parked further ahead on the same side. A tall apartment building rises in the background to the left, while dense foliage covers the right side.

The subsequent frames show no new objects or significant positional changes of existing elements relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The sole dynamic aspect is the continuous, heavy rainfall cascading across the entire scene, causing ripples on the wet road and dripping from the surrounding trees and vehicles.
