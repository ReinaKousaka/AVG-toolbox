The first frame depicts a man in a blue jacket walking away from the viewer on a concrete path, flanked by two stone-faced buildings under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's left is a large building with stairs leading to an elevated entrance and a rooftop area enclosed by a black fence, while a section of another building and a black dumpster are positioned to the viewer's right.

As the frames progress, the initial man continues walking further away. Subsequently, another person becomes visible to the left of the path, also moving away from the viewer, appearing from behind the first man. Further along the path and to the distant left, a third person appears, walking towards the viewer from the building on the left. Finally, a tall light pole becomes visible behind the buildings, rising above the rooftop fence on the right side of the scene.

The first frame displays a paved path extending away from the viewer, flanked by a large brick and concrete building with a black fence and a metal staircase on the left, and a brick building with a red roof on the right, further in the distance. In the midground, a man in a blue jacket walks away from the viewer on the path, while a woman in dark attire stands further ahead on the path's left. A large black dumpster is visible in the foreground to the right, and patches of reddish foliage are to the left.
end of description
From the initial viewpoint, the man continues to walk further away down the path, receding into the distance. Concurrently, the woman, initially standing on the left side of the path, begins to walk towards the viewer. She proceeds to move past the first-frame's left-side position, eventually walking out of the frame to the left. The background buildings and the dumpster remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint throughout the sequence.
