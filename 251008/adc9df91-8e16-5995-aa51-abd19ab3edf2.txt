The first frame shows a rainy street scene in a city. In the foreground, a dark metal barrier spans the bottom, with a red and white pedestrian crossing to the right. The midground features a wet, multi-lane road extending into the distance, with several cars moving, including a white SUV and a black car on the left. An elevated pedestrian bridge, decorated with green foliage and yellow sunflowers, crosses above the road, showing a person with an umbrella walking from right to left on it. Traffic lights and signs are attached to the bridge, and tall buildings line the background.

A person with an umbrella, initially on the pedestrian bridge above the right-center of the road, walks steadily towards the left side of the bridge, eventually exiting the frame. Concurrently, cars on the wet road below the bridge move across the lanes; a white car in the left lane drives towards the right, while other vehicles in the distance also change position. The speed limit sign displayed on the pedestrian bridge also changes periodically, showing '60', '50', and '80' kilometer limits. Additionally, a 'Rain Everyday' watermark intermittently appears and disappears in the bottom-left corner of the frames.

The first frame captures a rainy city street scene looking forward, with a wide, wet multi-lane road occupying the foreground, marked with white lines and an orange-red bike lane on the right. A large pedestrian overpass, adorned with painted greenery and sunflowers, spans horizontally across the midground, featuring green traffic lights and signs, and an ascending staircase on its right side. In the background, tall, modern buildings line both sides of the street under an overcast sky, while a dark car is visible on the far left lane of the road.

Subsequently, a person emerges from behind the viewer on the far right and progressively climbs the pedestrian overpass staircase. The individual steadily moves upwards on the stairs, and by the final frame, is visibly halfway up the second flight, now holding an open white umbrella, all within the right side of the scene.
