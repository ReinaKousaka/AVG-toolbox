As the scene progresses, the viewer's perspective advances, causing the initial foreground sedan to recede behind the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the billboard and original traffic lights on the right disappear, while a green highway sign on the left becomes clearer and a motorcycle moves forward in the center lane before turning right, as new traffic lights in the upper center illuminate green.
