The first frame captures a bustling night market. In the foreground-right, a masked vendor in a red hat sits behind a table adorned with glowing yellow sphere lights and other products, with another person seated directly behind them. To the foreground-left, a woman in a light coat, a child in purple, and a masked man in a green jacket stand, facing the vendor, with the man observing items in a clear dome on an adjacent small table. Further into the midground-left, a crowd of masked pedestrians walks along a street flanked by buildings, all illuminated by colorful overhead string lights patterned with traditional Korean lantern shapes; "SEOUL WALKER" and "KOREA TOURISM ORGANIZATION" logos are visible at the bottom of the frame.

Subsequent frames show almost imperceptible movements among the foreground individuals and the distant crowd, but no new objects or scenes are revealed relative to the first-frame viewpoint, maintaining the initial market scene.
