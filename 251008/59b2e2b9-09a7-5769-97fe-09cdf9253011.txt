In the first frame, a person in a light brown coat stands facing away on the left foreground, while two women, one in a brown coat with a backpack and another in a plaid coat and hijab holding a phone, stand facing away on the right foreground. The ground is covered in yellow leaves. A low wooden fence separates the foreground from the midground, where numerous people are gathered amidst large ginkgo trees with vibrant yellow foliage, particularly to the right and left of the center. In the background, a traditional Korean building with a red facade is visible centrally, flanked by other traditional buildings with blue roofs to the far left, all under a clear blue sky.

The person on the left foreground subtly adjusts their posture. The woman in the brown coat and backpack on the right turns her head to face the viewer, revealing a smile. Her companion in the plaid coat next to her slightly lowers her phone and gestures towards the other woman. Other individuals in the midground area behind the fence continue to move and shift positions.
