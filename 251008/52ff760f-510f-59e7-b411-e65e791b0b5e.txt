In the first frame, a wet sidewalk with yellow tactile paving lines the left side, separated from a glistening asphalt road by a black metal railing in the foreground. A blue bus is visible in the mid-distance on the road, with a bus stop shelter to its right, while green hedges and trees run along the left side. In the background, tall buildings extend along the street under an overcast, rainy sky.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the blue bus in the mid-distance moves towards the viewer, and a silver car on the right side of the road drives away. A person holding a dark umbrella gradually appears on the left sidewalk, walking towards the viewer from the mid-left. The steady rain continues, visible as splashes on the wet pavement.

The first frame displays a wet urban street on a cloudy day, featuring a sidewalk on the left with a green hedge and white fence, bordering a street separated by a metal railing and a utility pole with banners. Down the wet asphalt road on the right, a blue bus is visible, while a person with an open black umbrella walks away from the viewer on the left sidewalk, with buildings lining the background.

The first frame depicts a wet urban scene on a rainy day, viewed from a sidewalk. In the foreground on the right, a dark pole with a partial colorful banner stands next to a metal railing that extends horizontally into the midground. The wet sidewalk, with yellow tactile paving, stretches from the left foreground towards the background, where a person holding a dark umbrella walks away from the viewer. To the left of the sidewalk, a continuous green hedge runs alongside a white fence, with trees above it and residential buildings beyond. On the right, a wet multi-lane road recedes into the distance, showing a partially visible white car and a blue bus moving away from the viewer, with a colorful building and bus stops lining the opposite side under an overcast sky.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the person with the umbrella continues to walk away from the viewer along the wet sidewalk. Simultaneously, the white car and blue bus on the street progressively move further into the distance, receding from the initial viewpoint. The rain continues to fall, maintaining the wet appearance of all surfaces.
