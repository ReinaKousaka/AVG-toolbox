The first frame displays a rainy city street scene from a ground-level perspective. In the immediate foreground on the right, a tree trunk partially obstructs a black metal fence running along a wet, patterned sidewalk. Further right on the sidewalk, two red scooters are parked near the tree, and a pedestrian holding an umbrella walks away from the viewer. A blue bus with "601" visible on its rear is positioned in the midground, moving away from the viewer on the wet road, which is separated by a row of yellow-capped bollards. Across the road, a line of buildings with visible shopfronts and numerous trees extend into the background on the left.
end of description
The blue bus steadily recedes further down the wet road, moving away from the viewer. This movement increasingly reveals the street ahead, including more of the road surface, additional bollards to the left, and previously obscured buildings and trees in the distance. The pedestrian on the right also continues walking away from the viewer.
