A paved road curves slightly to the right in the foreground, extending into the midground with a white line marking its right edge. To the right of the road is a grassy shoulder with a thin pole, while a rocky, vegetated embankment rises to the left. A dense forest covers a hillside further left, leading to a large, rocky mountain dominating the background under a blue sky with scattered clouds and sun glare.
end of description
The camera moves forward along the road, continuously revealing new sections of the grassy shoulder on the right and the rocky embankment and forested hillside on the left, now appearing to the sides of the initial viewpoint. A yellow marker on a pole emerges on the right side of the road in the midground, moving towards the viewer before receding from view ahead. A double yellow line progressively appears on the road's center, extending into the distance in front of the viewer. More of the mountain range and distant landscape unfold to the front-right of the original scene.
