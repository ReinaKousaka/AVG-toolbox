An aerial view captures a stadium complex next to a body of water. In the foreground, a dark river or lake occupies the bottom left, bordered by a sandy bank curving to the right. On this bank, at the bottom right, is a distinct light-colored, curved structure. A road with a small bridge crosses horizontally in the mid-ground, flanked by green trees and a large white tent to its right. The background is dominated by a large stadium with prominent yellow seating, a green field, a scoreboard, and two distinctive round, multi-level buildings with white domed roofs flanking its entrance. Distant urban buildings are visible in the far background.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily zooms in and tilts upwards, progressively enlarging the stadium and its immediate surroundings. The stadium's upper tiers and the far side of its structure become increasingly prominent and detailed, revealing more of its vast yellow seating. Concurrently, the urban landscape, including highways and buildings, previously indistinct behind and to the right of the stadium, becomes clearer and occupies a larger portion of the frame. The body of water in the bottom left and the distinct curved structure on the bank at the bottom right progressively recede from view.
