In the first frame, a grey pavement occupies the left foreground, bordered on its right by a long, narrow flower bed brimming with red, pink, purple, and yellow flowers. To the left stands a light orange building with display windows and a potted plant, while an asphalt road stretches uphill to the right, flanked by buildings with traditional balconies and stone walls.

The viewpoint advances forward, revealing more of the pavement and the extending flower bed on the right. A blue awning becomes visible above the orange building on the left, and a Swiss flag appears further back on the left side of the street. As the movement continues, a person is seen walking uphill in the far distance on the road.
