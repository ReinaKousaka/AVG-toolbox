The first frame depicts a narrow city street stretching into a hazy, light orange-tinted distance, lined on both sides by multi-story residential buildings. On the left, several motorcycles are parked along the sidewalk, extending from the mid-left towards the vanishing point. On the right, a row of parked cars occupies the street edge, with a dark grey car partially in the immediate foreground, and a pedestrian walking further down the sidewalk near a white car.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The parked grey car initially in the right foreground shifts right and out of view, fully revealing the "CERVECERIA Los Barriles" sign on the building. Similarly, the closest motorcycles on the left move past the viewer's position, uncovering more of the sidewalk and revealing the number "44" on a building further down on the left. The person walking on the right sidewalk and the buildings lining both sides of the street appear to draw closer to the original first-frame viewpoint, becoming more detailed as the camera advances down the road.

The first frame depicts a narrow city street, looking forward, flanked by multi-story buildings under a hazy, light brown sky. In the immediate foreground, two parked scooters are on the left sidewalk, and the front corner of a dark car is on the right. The street extends into the midground and background, marked by faint red lines down its center. On the left, a line of parked scooters and motorcycles stretches further down, alongside various storefronts and balconies. On the right, a row of parked cars is visible, with a person in dark clothing walking away from the viewer between a silver and white car, and a "VIAJES" sign visible further along the street.
end of description
The viewpoint advances steadily forward along the street. The two foreground scooters on the left move past the viewer and out of frame, revealing more of the sidewalk and storefronts, including a newly visible "SOLER" sign appearing further down the street from the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the dark car on the right exits the frame, and the person walking continues to move further away from the viewer before also exiting the frame to the right. New parked vehicles and building facades are progressively revealed directly ahead, taking the place of the initial background elements as the viewer moves forward.

The first frame shows a narrow city street extending into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings. On the left, a row of parked motorcycles and scooters is visible near a building with grey and yellowish facades. On the right, several cars, including a white car closest to the viewer, are parked along the curb next to buildings featuring dark grey, peach, and brown facades, with a Spanish flag hanging from a balcony further down. The street itself has a red dashed line in the center, and a light, hazy sky is visible above the buildings in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street, revealing new sections of buildings and parked vehicles ahead while the initial foreground objects recede behind the viewer. The white car on the right and the closest motorcycles on the left gradually move towards the rear of the frame and eventually out of view. Consequently, new cars appear further to the right and new motorcycles/scooters emerge further to the left, replacing the ones that have passed the viewer's position. The buildings lining both sides of the street continuously scroll past, revealing more of the urban environment further along the path of travel.

The first frame shows a narrow city street extending into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings on both sides under a light, overcast sky. A black scooter is visible in the bottom left foreground, and a red car is parked on the right, closest to the viewer, with other parked vehicles lining both sides further down the road.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the scooter on the left and the red car on the right gradually move out of frame. The buildings on both sides, along with the parked white van on the left and various vehicles on the right, progressively become closer and more detailed, revealing new sections of the street and buildings ahead.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a paved street, looking down a narrow urban thoroughfare. To the immediate left, a white van is parked partially on the curb, next to multi-story buildings with balconies and varied facades. To the immediate right, a blue van is parked alongside another building line. The street ahead features pink dashed lane markers and extends into the distance, flanked by continuous rows of buildings on both sides under an overcast sky. Further down the street, several other parked cars and faint pedestrian figures are visible.
end of description
The camera moves forward down the street. The white van on the viewer's left gradually moves out of the frame to the left, revealing more of the sidewalk and buildings previously behind its initial position. Simultaneously, the blue van on the viewer's right moves out of frame to the right as the viewpoint progresses past it. Two pedestrians, initially further down the street on the left, become more prominent and closer to the viewer on the left sidewalk. A white parked car, previously partially visible further down the street on the right, becomes more centrally located in the frame.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a street scene looking forward, with colorful multi-story buildings flanking both sides under an overcast sky. A man in a dark jacket walks away on the left sidewalk, a white car is partially visible on the right foreground, and a black car is parked further down on the left, with another person on the right sidewalk in the midground.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the white car on the right and the man on the left exit the frame. The street ahead and its surrounding buildings grow larger and more detailed relative to the viewer, revealing a prominent street sign and later a new person walking on the right sidewalk.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A narrow city street stretches into the distance, flanked by multi-story residential buildings on both sides, under an overcast sky. In the foreground, a dark car is parked on the left, and a person walks on the right sidewalk near a parked scooter and a '30' speed limit sign.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly advances down the street, revealing more details of the buildings and parked vehicles ahead. The dark car on the left and the walking person on the right move progressively closer to and then past the viewer's initial position. A white car becomes visible parked behind the dark car on the left, and a red awning with a shop sign comes into view on the left building.
