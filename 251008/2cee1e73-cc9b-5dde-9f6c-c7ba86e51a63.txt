In the first frame, a yellow taxi is positioned centrally on the road in front of the viewer, with a large brick building on the immediate left and a row of diverse buildings and parked cars lining the right. Overhead, green traffic lights and street signs for 'Fayette St' to the upper left and 'Saratoga St' to the upper right are visible. On the far left sidewalk, a pedestrian and two orange traffic cones are present, while a pedestrian bridge connects buildings in the distance ahead.

As the viewpoint advances forward, the pedestrian and orange cones on the immediate left recede out of view behind the original position. The yellow taxi remains in front, while the street environment progressively shifts closer, revealing more parked cars and street signs along both sidewalks that were further down the street in the first frame. Buildings on both sides appear to get closer and taller, expanding to fill more of the lateral view.

In the first frame, a city street view looks forward. To the immediate left, a partial view of a light-colored Jeep SUV is visible, followed by a dark SUV and a red SUV parked along the curb next to a beige building. A small tree stands between the viewer and the dark SUV. Centrally ahead in the driving lane is a yellow taxi, while to the right, several cars are parked alongside a multi-story brick building. A glass skywalk connecting two tall buildings spans the street in the background.

The viewpoint progresses forward along the street. The light-colored Jeep and subsequent parked dark SUV and red SUV on the left move out of frame to the left and behind the viewer. This movement reveals a white cargo van, then a bright green sedan, and finally a white sedan, all parked on the left side behind the initial vehicles. Additionally, pedestrians become visible on the left sidewalk behind the newly revealed parked cars. The yellow taxi ahead maintains its central position as the viewer continues moving forward past other parked cars on both sides.

A green car occupies the foreground on the viewer's left, followed by a white sedan and a white FedEx truck further down the street on the left. Ahead in the center, a yellow taxi and a dark SUV are visible on the road, which is flanked by multi-story buildings on both sides. A pedestrian skywalk labeled "Mercy" crosses above the street in the mid-distance, with more distant buildings and a blue sky in the background.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the green car, then the white sedan, and finally the FedEx truck exit the frame to the left, revealing more of the sidewalk and the building structure previously obscured on the left side of the street. The yellow taxi and dark SUV ahead of the viewer gradually move forward along the road.
