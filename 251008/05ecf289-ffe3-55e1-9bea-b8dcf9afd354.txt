The first frame depicts a paved road with a white dashed line extending forward, flanked by a forested slope on the left and a steep, rocky mountain face on the right, where a triangular road sign indicating a right curve is visible relative to the viewer. Lush green mountains form the background under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the road sign on the right recedes from view, and rockfall protection netting becomes increasingly prominent along the right mountain face further ahead. The road curves more distinctly to the left, continuously revealing new sections of the verdant mountain pass as the viewer progresses.
