In the first frame, an urban street at night is visible, populated by several pedestrians. To the viewer's immediate right, part of a person carrying a yellow bag is seen. Ahead and to the right, a group of people walk away from the viewer, one notably carrying a yellow duck backpack. To the left of center, a person in dark attire and a beanie walks towards the viewer. The background is dominated by multi-story buildings covered in numerous bright, illuminated signs and posters, characteristic of a bustling city, including a prominent yellow and red ramen shop sign to the left-center, with several A-frame signs on the sidewalk in front of it. The street surface is dark asphalt with white pedestrian markings.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint advances slowly along the street. The pedestrian initially seen walking towards the viewer on the left continues forward, passing the viewer's original position. Simultaneously, the group of people on the right side of the street and the individual partially visible to the viewer's immediate right continue to move further away from the first-frame's perspective, becoming smaller as the viewpoint shifts forward.
