A narrow, pedestrian-filled street lined with multi-story buildings stretches forward, featuring shops with red awnings and outdoor seating on the right, and other storefronts on the left, under an overcast sky. Several people are browsing merchandise on the far left foreground, while others walk away from the viewer down the center of the street.

As the viewpoint advances, the individuals on the left and the outdoor seating on the right move past, revealing more of the shop facades and the street further into the alley. People previously in the mid-distance become closer, and the street's curve to the right becomes more pronounced, showing deeper into the urban passage.
