The first frame presents a rainy street with a wet reddish-brown sidewalk and a greenish-blue canal on the right, lined by trees and a grey utility pole. To the left is a wet asphalt road extending into a misty distance, with a bus stop shelter further along the right-side sidewalk and buildings visible behind the trees. end of description
From the second frame, a yellow umbrella progressively lowers into view from the top-center, covering the upper portion of the scene. Concurrently, the viewpoint shifts slightly forward relative to the initial position, causing the utility pole on the sidewalk to grow larger and move towards the left edge of the frame. Consequently, the bus stop and the canal on the right also appear incrementally closer, as heavy rain continues to fall across the entire wet landscape.

From the viewer's perspective, positioned under a yellow object (likely an umbrella) partially visible at the top-left, a wet, brick-paved sidewalk extends forward on the left, bordered by a darker green path to its right. To the left of the sidewalk, a rain-soaked asphalt road with white lane markings stretches into the distance, with a metal barrier along its far side. Several trees line the sidewalk, with a lamppost standing between them, and further ahead, a bus stop shelter with a dark blue canopy is visible. On the right, a verdant embankment covered in dense bushes and trees runs parallel to the green path, all under a heavily overcast sky with visible falling rain.

Rain consistently falls heavily throughout the frames, intensifying the water flow on the ground surfaces. The leaves of the trees lining the sidewalk visibly sway and rustle more noticeably, indicating gusting wind. The most significant dynamic change is the dark blue canopy of the bus stop shelter repeatedly lifting and flapping violently upwards due to strong wind, momentarily exposing its lighter underside. Furthermore, a small, dark tree branch or piece of debris appears on the wet sidewalk near the base of the leftmost visible tree.

In the first frame, heavy rain falls on a wet street. To the viewer's left, an asphalt road with white markings recedes into the misty background, bordered by a dark fence and distant trees. On the sidewalk in the mid-left, a grey pole stands, with a fallen scooter lying near the base of a tree. To the right of the tree, a bus stop shelter with a blue roof and an orange object beneath it faces the viewer, adjacent to a wet green path that leads into more trees and a distant misty background on the far right.
end of description
As frames progress, the water level noticeably rises on the sidewalk and around the scooter and tree in the mid-left, indicating increasing accumulation. The blue roof of the bus stop, located in the mid-right, appears to lift slightly, revealing more of the orange object inside it, which clarifies into the upper body of a person. Further along the path in the background-right, a figure holding an umbrella emerges, walking away from the viewer.
