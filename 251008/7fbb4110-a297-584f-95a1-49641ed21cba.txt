The first frame depicts a rainy street scene with a wet brown sidewalk on the left foreground and a green path to its right, adjacent to ascending concrete steps and a utility box further right. On the wet road to the left, a white SUV moves away from the viewer, while a black fence and a line of trees separate the road from the sidewalk, extending into the misty distance.

In subsequent frames, the initial white SUV continues its movement away from the viewer, and new vehicles, including another white car and a dark-colored car, emerge from the left side of the frame, also moving away along the road. The heavy rain persists throughout, maintaining the wet conditions and blurring the distant background elements.

The first frame depicts a rainy street scene with a wet asphalt road extending from the viewer into the hazy distance, where heavy rain is visible. On the near left, a white sedan is moving away on the road, which is bordered by a black metal fence separating it from a treed embankment. To the viewer's right, a brown-tiled sidewalk, featuring a dark utility pole and a row of trees, parallels the road and leads to a light-colored utility box and concrete steps in the mid-ground on the far right.

The white sedan on the left lane moves further into the distance as a larger white SUV enters the frame from the left foreground. This white SUV then proceeds down the road, gradually receding, while a smaller white car also appears closer to the viewer in the right lane and moves away. Throughout the frames, other distant vehicles are faintly visible through the heavy rainfall as all traffic moves away from the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a rainy street scene viewed from a sidewalk. To the left, a prominent tree trunk stands closest to the viewer, with a paved sidewalk stretching towards the right and receding into the distance, lined by several other trees. Adjacent to the sidewalk on the left is a wet two-lane road with a black metal barrier separating it from a colorful background wall. On the road, a white SUV is visible further down, moving away from the viewer. The entire scene is enveloped in falling rain, blurring the distant background of green trees.
end of description
Following frames show a silver sedan entering the left lane of the road, moving away from the viewer, creating a significant spray of water as it progresses. Subsequently, a dark sedan appears in the same left lane, closer to the viewer than the initial silver car, also moving away and generating a visible water wake. The heavy rainfall and wet conditions on the road and sidewalk persist consistently throughout all frames.
