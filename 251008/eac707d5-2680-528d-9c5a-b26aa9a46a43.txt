In the first frame, a woman holding a white umbrella with heart patterns walks away from the viewer on a wet paved sidewalk, positioned in the foreground-left. To her left, a dense green hedge borders a tree-covered slope. On the right, a metal fence and a black and yellow striped barrier are in the midground, with a wet asphalt road extending into the distance beyond them. Several cars are visible on the road ahead, driving towards the viewer, under a bright, overcast sky. Heavy rain is falling across the entire scene, and a dark tree trunk is partially visible on the far right.

The woman carrying the umbrella moves out of the frame to the left, revealing the previously obscured wet sidewalk and the continuous green hedge alongside it. Simultaneously, vehicles on the road ahead proceed towards the viewer, and a red bus becomes more clearly visible in the background on the right side of the road. The heavy rainfall continues throughout the sequence.

As the heavy rain persists, a red and white bus (number 1000) progressively drives into view from the far right of the road, behind the initial stationary cars. It continues to move forward and leftwards relative to the first-frame viewpoint, passing the parked vehicles, eventually settling in the mid-ground alongside the street.

The first frame shows a rainy city street. To the left, a lush green hillside with trees borders a wet sidewalk. On the right, a wet road holds stationary vehicles: a white sedan in the mid-ground, a white SUV behind and to its right, and a bus further back, with buildings in the misty background and a light pole foreground-right. end of description. Throughout the following frames, the heavy rain continues to fall, creating visible splashes and reflections on the wet surfaces, while the cars remain stationary with their lights on, and no new objects or scenes emerge.
