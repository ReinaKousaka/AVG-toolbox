The first frame depicts a bright city street under a clear blue sky. Directly ahead of the viewer are a white minivan and a white truck on an asphalt road with visible lane markings. To the viewer's left, a row of commercial buildings extends into the distance, while to the right, behind a metal barrier, tall residential apartment blocks, including an "I'PARK" building, dominate the mid-ground and horizon.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the white minivan and truck ahead to recede into the distance. Concurrently, the buildings on both sides, including the "I'PARK" structure on the right and the commercial buildings on the left, appear to approach and enlarge. A traffic light positioned to the left also moves closer, eventually passing the viewer's position.

The first frame displays a sunny city street, with the viewer on a multi-lane road looking ahead towards a white van and a white truck, followed by other distant vehicles. To the left, commercial buildings with colorful signs and a tall apartment complex rise, contrasting with a sidewalk, bare trees, and utility poles on the right, which precede several towering apartment buildings under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, the vehicles ahead draw nearer and shift slightly right, while new road markings, including arrows, become visible on the asphalt directly beneath the viewer. Concurrently, a yellow taxi emerges from the right side of the scene, approaching the intersection, and pedestrians appear on the right-hand sidewalk, revealing more of the street's activity.

The first frame depicts a sunny city street intersection from a forward-facing viewpoint. To the left, a beige building with shops and multiple vehicles, including a prominent black sedan, line the road. A tall, light-colored apartment building dominates the right, bordering a sidewalk with a person walking away and a delivery scooter. In the center, traffic lights are green, with a white truck, a white van, and an orange taxi positioned to move forward into the distance, where more buildings recede under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The black sedan on the left begins moving forward, progressively exiting the frame to the left. Concurrently, the orange taxi on the right, along with the white truck and van in the center lanes, advances through the intersection away from the viewer. A blue bus then appears from the left, crossing the intersection away from the viewer, while the person and delivery scooter on the right sidewalk move further away and eventually exit the frame to the right.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures a sunny city street intersection from a forward-facing viewpoint, with a wide crosswalk visible directly in front. Tall residential buildings line both the left and right sides of the street, while two green traffic lights hang above the road ahead, slightly right of center. To the immediate right, a yellow taxi is stopped beside a construction fence, and further left, a blue bus and a white truck are among other vehicles in their respective lanes.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the yellow taxi on the right moves forward, exiting the frame, and the viewpoint advances, causing the initial crosswalk to recede. The white truck and blue bus in the distance also move further ahead relative to the first-frame's perspective. The two traffic lights, initially green, sequentially turn amber and then red as the camera continues forward along the street.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a multi-lane asphalt road stretches directly ahead of the viewer, marked with white arrows and a blue bike lane icon. To the viewer's immediate left, a white car is partially visible, followed by a gray minivan, both parked roadside. Further down the road in the center, a white box truck is moving forward. On the left side of the road, various low-rise buildings with bare trees line the street, while on the right, a tall, grey apartment building with numerous windows dominates, separated from the sidewalk by a metal fence and more bare trees. The entire scene is under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the gray minivan on the left moves forward, revealing more of the white car, and then exits the frame to the left, while the white box truck in the center continues moving forward and further away. A yellow taxi appears in the right-center lane, moving forward from behind the white truck's initial position. Subsequently, a blue truck enters the frame from the left, also moving forward, passing the initial position of the gray minivan. A pedestrian is also revealed on the far right sidewalk, walking towards the viewer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a multi-lane urban road extending into the distance under a clear blue sky. Directly in front of the viewer are road markings including white lines and blue text on the asphalt. To the left, a sidewalk with parked cars leads to various low-rise buildings and bare trees, with a streetlight visible near the upper left. To the right, a dark fence with square panels runs alongside the road, behind which stand bare trees and taller, light-colored apartment buildings. A white truck is in the middle lane ahead, and a yellow bus/van is further ahead in the right lane.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the road markings to move from the foreground towards and under the viewer. The white truck and yellow bus ahead appear to get closer. A dark blue SUV enters the frame from the bottom left, moving forward alongside the viewer, while other cars on the left appear to be passed. Buildings and street features on both sides of the road gradually shift towards and past the viewer, revealing new sections of the street ahead.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a multi-lane road extends into the distance under a clear blue sky. A dark-colored SUV occupies the lower-left foreground, while various buildings of different heights and colors (purple, white, light blue) line both sides of the street. Bare trees, utility poles with wires, and streetlights are visible on the sidewalks, with several vehicles, including trucks, cars, and a yellow bus, present on the road and parked along the right side.
end of description
The dark SUV in the left foreground moves forward, progressively exiting the frame to the left, which reveals a white SUV previously behind it and to the left of the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the entire street scene advances as if the viewer is moving forward, causing the buildings and trees along both sides to shift closer and revealing new sections of the road and sidewalks further down the street from their original positions. Consequently, parked cars on the right side and traffic in the center lanes, including a yellow truck, appear to move forward and become more prominent relative to the first-frame's perspective.
