The first frame displays a mountain village scene with a prominent dark brown 'Gasthof Zilm' building on the left-midground, backed by distant snow-capped mountains and a red-roofed building. In the foreground, two wooden benches and a trash can rest on a paved area adjacent to a grassy slope with tiered retaining walls on the right.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly pans left, progressively revealing a tall evergreen tree and another building further down the street to the left of the 'Gasthof Zilm' that were initially unseen behind the viewer's left. Concurrently, the evergreen tree originally at the far right of the first frame gradually moves out of view to the right, behind the viewer.
