In the first frame, a dark blue/black Ford F-150 pickup truck is parked to the viewer's left on a snowy patch, its rear facing away. To the viewer's immediate right, the rear bed of a light-colored pickup truck is partially visible. A paved road extends into the midground, flanked by snow, leading to a two-story building across the street with a red-brown lower facade and a gray upper facade featuring a balcony. To its right, the "Ennis Trading Post" building is visible, while to its left, a row of other small town buildings and bare trees line the street. The background features faint mountains to the far left and a bright, cloudy blue sky with a prominent sun glare in the upper center.

From frame 4, an American flag and a "Sundance House Restaurant" sign become visible to the far left, above and behind the dark Ford truck. A blue and white cooler then appears inside the bed of the dark Ford pickup truck, which is to the viewer's left. The viewpoint subtly shifts leftward, revealing more of the sidewalk and street further down on the left, bringing a black SUV parked behind the dark Ford truck into fuller view. By frame 8, a gray trash can is newly visible on the sidewalk to the far left.

The first frame shows the rear of a black F-150 truck with a blue cooler on the far right, while a beige trash can, wooden fence, and snowy sidewalk occupy the left, leading past a parked black SUV on a snow-lined street. In the background, a 'Soda Fountain & Restaurant' building with an American flag is visible on the left under a bright blue sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the F-150 truck on the right and the trash can on the left to exit the frame. A yellow 'Be Kind' sign on the fence and a blue disabled parking sign, initially partially obscured, become fully visible and increasingly prominent to the left, as the black SUV and background buildings appear closer to the viewer.
