The first frame depicts a rainy city night scene with a wet asphalt road on the left and a tiled sidewalk on the right. A prominent tree trunk stands in the center-left foreground, while a person holding an umbrella walks away from the viewer along the right sidewalk, past illuminated storefronts. A white SUV with red brake lights is stopped on the road ahead of the viewer, reflecting the city lights.
end of description
The person with the umbrella continues walking away on the right sidewalk, eventually moving out of the frame. Simultaneously, a blue car appears from the background on the far left lane, driving towards and then past the stationary white SUV. The white SUV's brake lights remain on throughout these changes, as the rain continues to fall.
