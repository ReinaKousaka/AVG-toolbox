The first frame presents a rainy city street at night, viewed from behind a wet surface, with a glistening sidewalk and yellow bollards in the immediate foreground. In the midground, a glass shelter containing two people is central, flanked by a bare tree to its left and an intersection with traffic lights further left, while a street lined with illuminated buildings, including a "Subway" sign, extends into the background on the right.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly pans right, causing the blue street sign and utility box initially on the far left to move out of the visible area. Concurrently, more of the street and additional illuminated storefronts, previously further down the block on the right, become newly revealed and more centrally located within the expanding scene. The two individuals inside the glass shelter, along with the nearby tree, shift from their initial mid-left position towards the center as the perspective broadens to the right.

The first frame depicts a rainy night street scene from the perspective of an observer behind a wet window, with a brightly lit subway entrance dominating the midground. Two figures stand beside an open black umbrella at the entrance, while wet pavements reflect streetlights and distant buildings rise under a dark sky.

Following this, the internal lighting of the subway entrance, directly ahead, dynamically changes its color and pattern. Concurrently, the black umbrella near the figures at the entrance closes and is picked up, while a metal grate descends, progressively closing the subway entrance in front. The two figures remain near the now-closing entrance as the gate continues to descend.
