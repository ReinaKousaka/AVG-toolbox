A cobblestone town square is visible under an overcast sky. In the foreground to the left, a woman in an orange shirt sits on a low stone bench, looking down. A large brown planter with a green tree stands centrally in the midground, with three men in orange shirts and hats standing near it to the right. To the far right, a crowd gathers under a red awning and white tents. On the left, a multi-lamp street light and a stone fountain are present, with several small white tables and chairs. In the background, a large pink building with a green-spired tower and flags is prominent to the right, flanked by darker, older buildings to the left.
end of description
The woman on the left first rises from her seated position into a squat, then stands up. She then proceeds to walk towards the viewer and slightly to the right, passing the decorative lamppost on the left. As she walks, a white "Bilburger" trailer, previously at the far left edge of the frame, becomes fully visible behind her as she moves right.
