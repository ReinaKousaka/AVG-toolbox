The first frame depicts a wide city street on an overcast day, looking forward from just before a pedestrian crosswalk. To the viewer's immediate left, a traffic light pole stands near a sidewalk, with a row of multi-story buildings and parked cars lining the street, followed by a median with palm trees. To the right, another row of lighter-colored buildings with storefronts, pedestrians, and parked cars runs alongside, with an overhead traffic light displaying "Dauphine" and green signals further down the street. The street extends into the distance, bordered by palm trees and buildings, with distant cars and a construction crane visible under a cloudy sky.

From the initial viewpoint, the entire street scene, including the buildings, palm trees, and distant vehicles, progressively shifts *closer* over the frames. The pedestrian crosswalk, initially in the immediate foreground, effectively moves *underneath* and *behind* the stationary first-frame viewpoint. Similarly, the traffic light pole on the left and the overhead street sign to the right appear to approach the viewer's initial position as the scene advances. No new objects are revealed from outside the original frame, merely a continuous forward progression of the existing scene toward the fixed first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a multi-lane city street looking forward, with crosswalk stripes in the foreground. To the left, a green traffic light hangs from a street pole, with historic buildings, palm trees, and streetcar tracks lining the sidewalk; on the right, modern multi-story buildings, parked cars, and pedestrians are visible.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances forward, the initial traffic light moves out of view to the left, and a "JAZZ FEST" banner attached to a palm tree on the left side of the street becomes fully visible. Further progression causes the street poles and parked cars to the left and right to shift into the foreground and then out of view, continually revealing more of the street and distant buildings.

The first frame displays a wide street scene under an overcast sky. Directly in front, an asphalt road with white lane markings extends into the distance. To the left, a median with tram tracks runs parallel to the road, bordered by historic buildings with balconies and numerous palm trees. Along the right side of the road, more multi-story buildings, some under construction, are visible alongside additional palm trees and parked cars. Further down the street, an intersection with traffic lights is discernible, framed by various distant buildings and billboards.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses forward down the street. A silver SUV, initially to the right and slightly ahead of the first-frame viewpoint, moves past to the viewer's right. The distant intersection with traffic lights, initially red, changes to green as the viewer approaches it. Buildings and street furniture previously further ahead on both sides of the road gradually appear closer and then recede behind the viewer's immediate field of view.
