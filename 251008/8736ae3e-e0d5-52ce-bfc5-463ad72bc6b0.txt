The first frame displays a wet city sidewalk on an overcast day. To the left, bicycles are parked in white racks in front of a white van/bus, next to a tree trunk and an informational sign. On the right, a pedestrian holding a black umbrella walks forward along the sidewalk, adjacent to a building with reflective windows and a garage-like entrance. Further down the street, other pedestrians with umbrellas are visible, with tall city buildings in the background.

end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk. The person with the black umbrella on the right walks further past the viewer, while the white van on the left slowly moves forward. A light blue face mask becomes visible on the wet ground to the left, near the parked bicycles.

In the first frame, a wet city sidewalk stretches from the foreground into the background, flanked on the left by a tree trunk, a metal railing, and several parked bicycles (one covered), alongside a busy street with a grey car and an orange bus. To the right, a long building with reflective windows and several closed metal shutters dominates, with a series of people under umbrellas walking away from the viewer along the sidewalk. In the background, distant buildings rise under an overcast sky.
end of description
A woman in a black skirt and white coat, holding a transparent umbrella, walks from the mid-right foreground towards the viewer, soon followed by another person in a beige trench coat with an umbrella. The woman in the black skirt progressively lowers her umbrella and begins looking at her phone. Simultaneously, other pedestrians further down the sidewalk continue their movement, with some walking towards the viewer and others away. On the street to the left, a grey car slowly recedes further into the background.

The first frame presents a wet city street on a rainy day, looking forward down a sidewalk lined with a building on the right and a street on the left. In the immediate foreground to the right, a woman in a white coat and a man in a trench coat, both holding clear umbrellas, walk away from the viewer. To the left, a bicycle rack, a tree trunk, and a bus stop sign are partially visible.
end of description
As the camera progresses forward, the initial woman and man move further away and eventually exit the frame towards the front-right of the original viewpoint. Concurrently, new pedestrians continuously enter the scene from behind the camera's initial position on the right, moving into the midground. The camera's own clear umbrella gradually enters the top of the frame from above the original viewpoint, expanding to obscure the upper portion of the scene.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
From the viewer's perspective beneath a clear umbrella, a wet city street and sidewalk stretch forward, flanked by tall buildings on the left and a shuttered building on the right, marked 'Keio'. Pedestrians with umbrellas populate the mid-ground, with one person in a dark coat and umbrella walking towards the viewer on the right sidewalk.
end of description
The person with the dark umbrella on the right continues walking towards the viewer, their movement gradually revealing more of the "Keio" sign on the building to their right. Subsequently, another masked individual in dark clothing emerges from behind the first person, also moving towards the viewer on the right side of the path, eventually passing the first person who exits the frame to the viewer's immediate left.

A clear umbrella partially covers the top of the frame, overlooking a wet city street and sidewalk. On the left foreground, a black bollard stands on the pavement, while a person in a light raincoat and boots stands further back, facing right. To the far left, a multi-lane road stretches with distant cars and tall buildings, including a distinctive white domed structure. On the right, a long building facade features an entrance where people are visible inside, and a person in a dark jacket and mask walks left near a partially visible metal shutter with "Keio" written on it.
end of description
A masked person on the far right initially walks left across the foreground sidewalk, gradually exiting the frame to the left. Concurrently, the large metal shutter on the right begins to slowly roll upwards, eventually revealing a new person emerging from behind it. This second individual, dressed in dark clothing, walks out from the right side of the frame towards the viewer and slightly left.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a person in a silvery raincoat and dark boots stands left of center on a wet street, facing away from the viewer towards distant tall buildings and a distinctive white spherical structure in the midground left. To the right, a wet sidewalk with yellow tactile paving leads past a small covered structure with a red sign, where several pedestrians with umbrellas walk away, towards a large partially open metallic roll-down door revealing an indoor area with a person in a dark uniform and face mask standing inside on the right.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the large metallic roll-down door on the far right progressively slides open wider, revealing more of the indoor area previously obscured, including additional items and another person further inside the entrance to the right of the initially visible person. The person in the dark uniform remains visible at their position inside the opening as the doorway expands.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a person in a clear raincoat and mask stands in the foreground to the viewer's left on a wet pavement, facing forward, with a wet street and a bus stop structure extending into the midground. To the right, a building facade with entrances holds a uniformed person wearing a mask in the midground, with other pedestrians further down the wet sidewalk. Tall buildings line the street on the far left and in the distant background, under a grey sky.
end of description
As frames progress, the person in the raincoat on the far left moves out of frame to the left, gradually revealing the wet pavement beneath, while the uniformed person on the right walks further into the building entrance, becoming less visible.
