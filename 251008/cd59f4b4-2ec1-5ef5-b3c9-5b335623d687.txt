In the first frame, a wet city street at night is visible, extending away from the viewer towards the left and right. To the viewer's immediate right, a sidewalk features several trees, two electric scooters (one green/black, one blue/white) parked against a tree trunk, and reflections from overhead lights. Across the street, to the left of the viewer, multiple buildings with illuminated signs and windows line the road, with several dark cars parked along the curb.

As the frames progress, a white car slowly pulls into a parking spot further down the street, on the right side, eventually stopping just beyond the tree with the scooters and slightly ahead of the first-frame viewpoint. No other significant dynamic changes or newly revealed objects occur; the rain continues throughout the scene.

In the first frame, a wet, rain-slicked city street at night is visible, flanked by buildings on the left and a sidewalk on the right. In the foreground, a dark tree trunk and a light pole stand centrally, with a green electric scooter leaning against the tree on the left, and a purple electric scooter parked on the sidewalk to the right. Beyond the foreground elements, two dark cars are parked on the left side of the street, and a white car is parked on the right, further down. The background reveals illuminated multi-story buildings on the left and a street extending into the distance with traffic lights and more trees on the right.

As the frames progress, the green scooter in the foreground, to the left of the viewer, gradually disappears. Concurrently, a light-colored car emerges in the far background of the left lane around frame 4, slowly moving towards the viewer. Subsequently, a dark SUV-like car enters the mid-ground of the left lane in frame 6, traveling past the viewer from right to left.

A rainy night city street scene features a dark pole on the far left, a blue electric scooter parked near a trash bin, and a tree trunk on the right foreground. On the wet, reflective street, a grey SUV drives away from the viewer, while a white car is parked on the right, with illuminated buildings and neon signs lining the background.
end of description
The grey SUV continues driving away, followed by a newly revealed dark car emerging from the left midground and also proceeding forward. Concurrently, a white car slightly shifts position further down the street on the right, and the distant traffic light changes from green to red. Finally, a delivery scooter travels from the left across the midground street.
