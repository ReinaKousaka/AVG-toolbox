As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly pans rightward, revealing more of the church's ornate facade on its right side. An additional arched entryway or window at the lower right of the church gradually becomes more visible, moving further into the frame from the original right edge. The imposing spire, initially center-right, slowly shifts slightly leftwards in the overall composition as more of the church's breadth is revealed. The elements in the left-hand churchyard slightly recede, maintaining their spatial positions relative to the first frame.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the camera slowly and subtly pans to the right, incrementally revealing more of the church's rightmost section and a stone archway at the far right edge relative to the initial viewpoint. This gentle rightward rotation concurrently shifts the distant gravestones and tree slightly towards the left side of the frame, broadening the view of the church's intricate facade.
