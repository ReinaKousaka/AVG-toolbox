The first frame shows train tracks stretching into the distance, curving slightly right, flanked by dense green forests and bushes on both sides. Overhead wires extend along the track above the viewer, leading to a distant yellow signal post on the left and a less distinct white structure on the right, all under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the initial distant yellow signal post on the left and a white signal post on the right approach and then pass to their respective sides. An overhead line support pole on the left rapidly approaches, momentarily occupying the left foreground before passing the viewer. The surrounding vegetation on both sides continuously moves towards and past the viewer, revealing more of the curving tracks ahead and a glimpse of a red-roofed building in the far right distance.
