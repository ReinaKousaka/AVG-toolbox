The first frame displays a city street scene. In the foreground, a curved road with a white demarcation line is on the left, leading to a zebra crossing visible centrally. An orange and white tram with "AGENT" branding is positioned in the mid-ground, slightly right of center, on tracks, facing left. To the right of the tram, a row of parked cars runs parallel to it, while further left in the mid-ground, other cars are visible on the road. In the background, a large, light-colored building with multiple windows dominates the right side, and several grey multi-story buildings are visible on the left, with a traffic light structure showing red lights on the far left.
end of description
The orange and white tram steadily moves from its central-right position towards the left side of the frame, passing by the stationary cars initially to its right. Concurrently, other vehicles in the distant left of the street shift slightly, moving further away from the viewer. The traffic light on the far left remains red, while all surrounding buildings and the sky stay static relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

In the first frame, an orange and white tram is prominently positioned on the right, partially cut off by the frame edge, facing left. To the left of the tram, a red car is stopped on the road with a motorcyclist behind it, while several other cars are stationary in the lanes stretching into the distance towards the background. Overarching traffic lights displaying red are visible in the upper-left, connected by an overhead gantry that spans across the midground. Multiple buildings line both sides of the street, receding into the background, under a blue sky with scattered clouds.
end of description
The tram on the right slowly moves from right to left, steadily exiting the frame and fully revealing the building behind it. Concurrently, the viewer's perspective advances forward and slightly to the left, causing the traffic lights and the uppermost portion of the tall building on the far right to gradually move out of view by the fifth frame. As the viewpoint shifts, more of the street on the left, including parked cars and the facades of buildings, becomes visible, and road markings in the foreground advance towards the viewer.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a multi-lane urban road extending into the distance under a clear blue sky, flanked by buildings on both sides. An overhead gantry with blue directional signs is visible ahead, spanning the road. Several vehicles, including cars, a van, and a truck, are positioned ahead on the road, with tram tracks running along the far right side. Tall and commercial buildings line the street to the left and right of the viewer's perspective.

end of description

As the viewpoint advances forward, all previously visible objects ahead, like the overhead gantry and the array of vehicles on the road, draw closer. The blue directional sign on the gantry moves from being ahead to directly overhead, with its Japanese text becoming more defined. Buildings on both sides progressively enlarge and shift towards the frame's edges as the viewer passes them, revealing more of their lower facades.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays an urban street extending into the distance under a clear blue sky. Directly overhead, a metal gantry spans the road, holding a blue road sign indicating direction to Tokyo and other smaller signs. To the viewer's left, a light blue parked van sits beside a sidewalk lined with buildings of varying heights and storefronts, along with trees and traffic signs displaying 'no entry' and '40 km/h speed limit'. To the viewer's right, a white car is positioned near the curb, with more buildings, storefronts, and traffic lights lining the street. In the far distance, more vehicles and buildings are visible, including a red construction crane.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the overhead gantry and its signs rise and exit the top of the frame. The parked light blue van on the left and the white car on the right move towards the edges and eventually disappear from view, revealing new sections of sidewalk and buildings closer to the first-frame viewpoint. The traffic signs on the left also ascend out of view as the perspective advances down the road. The street continues straight ahead, with the distant red construction crane gradually becoming more prominent as the viewer approaches it.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a sunny city street scene from a driver's perspective, with a paved road and white lane markings stretching into the foreground. A white car travels ahead in the center lane, while buildings line both sides; a tall grey apartment building dominates the mid-left, and commercial structures with a white van and tram lines are on the mid-right. Pedestrians stand on the left sidewalk near a utility pole displaying street signs.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, the white car ahead appears to advance further, while two pedestrians on the left sidewalk become more prominent and closer to the viewer. The utility pole with multiple signs passes on the viewer's left, subsequently revealing a red stop sign and a "40" speed limit marking on the road ahead from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The viewer is positioned on a multi-lane city road looking forward, with a white car directly ahead, slightly left of the center lane, moving away from the viewer. The road surface prominently displays a yellow "40" speed limit marking. To the far left, a low building is visible, and above it, a red circular 'no entry' sign on a pole, with a tall grey apartment building rising behind it. On the right, a commercial street is lined with various buildings, including a white truck and a large blue-grey building topped with a red crane in the distance. Overhead, numerous utility lines crisscross against a clear blue sky.
end of description
The white car directly ahead recedes and diminishes in size as the viewpoint moves forward. The yellow "40" road marking moves backward and is replaced by a clear yellow 'X' marking on the asphalt. The red circular sign on the left moves out of frame, while a blue street sign with a Lawson logo appears clearer ahead on the left. Buildings and street elements on both sides continuously shift from the foreground towards the sides and background, revealing more of the road and distant city scene. The white truck on the far right also recedes and eventually exits the frame.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a multi-lane city street from a vehicle's perspective, featuring yellow road markings in the immediate foreground including a 'U-turn' arrow with an 'X'. Ahead and slightly left, a white car precedes the viewer towards a pedestrian crosswalk, with a red traffic light visible on the right. Tall buildings frame the road: a grey apartment complex with a Lawson sign on the left, and a construction site with a crane, alongside a yellow building, on the right.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the white car and other vehicles ahead advance further down the road, while the initial foreground road markings recede. Concurrently, the traffic light on the right changes from red to green.
