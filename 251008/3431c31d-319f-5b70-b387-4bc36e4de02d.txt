In the first frame, a paved road with white markings stretches into the middle ground, curving slightly to the right. To the left stands a multi-story, light-colored building with visible windows and shutters, with more dark-roofed buildings further down the street. On the right, another light-colored building with windows and shutters frames the scene, also curving with the road. In the middle ground, a dark-colored car is present on the road, with a streetlamp beyond it. Distant, snow-capped mountains are visible under a clear blue sky in the background, towering over houses nestled in the valley.

end of description

The dark-colored car, initially in the mid-ground, moves forward along the road, away from the viewer, eventually exiting the frame to the front-left. As the car recedes, more of the paved road and the buildings further down the street become visible, specifically revealing "KINO" text on the facade of a building on the right that was previously partially obscured. The snowy mountains and surrounding village structures remain largely static relative to the first-frame viewpoint, indicating the viewer is stationary.

First, the viewer looks down a village road with a dark brown building on the immediate left and a partially visible lighter-colored building with circular designs on the immediate right, while a lamppost stands mid-left and distant snow-capped mountains are centered in the background.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the initial buildings recede and move off-screen to their respective sides. Simultaneously, new road markings, including a red and white striped area and a white arrow, become visible directly ahead, and a staircase appears on the right-side building. The distant snow-capped peaks subtly shift leftward as the village scene continues to unfold.

The first frame displays a road leading into a mountain town, featuring a prominent white hotel building with dark shutters and an external staircase on the immediate right, and other multi-story buildings lining the left side of the street. In the midground, a street lamp stands on the left, while towering, partly snow-capped mountains form a majestic backdrop against a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the road markings, including yellow pedestrian stripes and a red-striped section on the left, advance towards and then recede beneath the viewer. The large white hotel on the right passes by, revealing more of its facade and a subsequent building, while a street lamp and other buildings on the left also move past relative to the initial viewpoint. A blue pedestrian crossing sign newly appears on the left and moves past the viewer, and a red bicycle lane with a symbol becomes clearly visible on the left side of the road, while the background mountains remain relatively static but subtly grow larger in perspective.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A road stretches directly ahead of the viewer, featuring a red bike lane with a white bicycle symbol and white/yellow markings on the left, and white double lines in the center. To the immediate left stands a grey multi-story building with green-shuttered windows, beyond which a yellow building is visible, with several cars parked in front. On the right, a cream-colored building features large windows and a blue sign advertising a hotel and bar, with a parking lot and a bare, pruned tree in front. In the background, tall, rugged mountains with some visible snow peaks rise under a clear blue sky, framing the distant end of the street.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the red bike lane and white markings on the left, and the cream-colored building with the blue sign on the right, progressively move closer and then out of frame to their respective sides, relative to the initial position. The grey building on the left, and the pruned tree and parking lot on the right, become more prominent and closer to the viewer. Simultaneously, the yellow building further down the road on the left and a small white house beyond the parking lot on the right become clearer and nearer, revealing more of the street leading towards the distant mountains.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
A paved road with white markings extends into the distance, flanked by buildings and trees. To the left, a multi-story grey building stands prominently, followed by a yellow building further down the street. On the right, a white building is partially obscured by a tall evergreen tree and a bare, pruned tree with distinct branches. Behind the urban elements, a massive mountain range with green slopes and rocky peaks rises under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses forward along the road. The bare tree on the far right quickly moves out of frame, while a yellow bus stop sign becomes fully visible to the right of the road, behind the evergreen tree. As the camera advances, the evergreen tree and the initial white building on the right move completely out of view, revealing more of the brown fence and a small white structure behind it. On the left, the grey building moves away to the left, revealing more of the yellow building and a parked car further down the street.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a paved road extending forward, with a prominent yellow building featuring red shutters on the left and a blue/grey building with a dark fence and streetlamp on the right. In the background, lush green mountains rise, culminating in distant snow-capped peaks under a clear sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the initial buildings on both sides move out of frame, revealing more distinct structures further down the street on the left, including pink and brown buildings. Concurrently on the right, a light-colored car previously hidden behind the fence is progressively revealed. The overall perspective shifts, bringing the viewer closer to the distant mountains as the road continues ahead.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a paved road leading into the distance, bordered by multi-story buildings; a yellow and a pinkish building with shutters are on the immediate left, while a blue-grey building with light blue shutters is on the immediate right, followed by a lighter building. In the background, green, tree-covered mountains rise steeply, topped by snow-capped peaks under a clear blue sky.
end of description.
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the street, the immediate buildings on the left and right move out of frame. A new brown wooden building with a covered area is revealed to the right of the road, having been behind the blue-grey building. On the left, a greyish-beige building with "Restaurant Bl√§s" signage, previously further down the street, now becomes prominent and closer to the viewer.
