frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a rural outdoor scene under a partly cloudy sky. A gravel path extends from the viewer's immediate foreground, curving slightly to the right, with a large, tarp-covered stack of firewood positioned to the right. In the mid-ground, a wooden barn-like structure with an open entrance and two figures is visible to the left, nestled into a grassy hillside, while a tall evergreen tree stands beside the path on the right. A grey informational overlay, including pace and distance, is present in the top-right corner.

The following frames show no dynamic changes in the physical environment or objects relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The only alteration is the 'Pace' value in the top-right overlay, which incrementally updates from 7:10 /km in the first frame to 7:35 /km by the last frame.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
In the first frame, a dirt path curves slightly to the right, leading into the midground. To the immediate right, a long stack of cut firewood is bundled and neatly piled, running parallel to the path. On the left, a rustic wooden building, possibly a barn or shed, with a partial open-front shelter, is nestled into a grassy hillside, housing a blue tractor. Beyond the building and stacked wood, a dense forest covers a steep hillside under a partly cloudy sky, with a large evergreen tree prominent on the right. An informational overlay in the top right shows "Pace: 7:35 /km", "Grade: 9%", and "DISTANCE: 6.0 KM".
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the dirt path, causing the stacked firewood on the right, the rustic building, and the blue tractor to appear closer and slightly larger relative to their initial positions. The foreground shadow on the path gradually recedes and shifts as the viewer advances. The informational overlay updates, showing the pace changing from 7:35 /km to 7:40 /km, and finally to 7:45 /km, while the grade and distance remain constant, indicating continued movement uphill.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a dirt road extending forward from the viewer. To the left, a weathered wooden shed or barn with an open front reveals a blue tractor and some covered items inside, situated on a grassy patch. To the right, a large stack of cut wood sits beside a prominent evergreen tree, with more grass beyond it. The road ascends gently into a grassy hillside, leading towards a distant forest on a higher slope, all under a blue sky with streaky clouds. Overlays in the top right corner display ride data including "7.45 km", "GRADE 9%", and "DISTANCE 6.0 KM".

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the dirt road, causing objects to recede. The wooden shed and the blue tractor within it move further to the left and slightly out of frame, while the stack of cut wood and the large evergreen tree on the right also recede and move mostly out of the right side of the frame. The dirt road ahead occupies more of the midground, and the distant hills and forest remain visible, gradually shifting perspective. The "km" counter in the top right overlay decreases from 7.45 km to 7.30 km, and the grade changes from 9% to 8%.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a rustic shed with a wooden roof and an open bay, housing a tarp-covered vehicle, is situated to the viewer's immediate left. A dirt road originates centrally at the bottom, winding uphill into the distance, flanked by green, grassy hillsides, with rocks visible on the left slope. A tall coniferous tree partially occupies the far right foreground, while a bare-branched tree stands further up the road, and a forest covers the upper left hillside and extends into the background on the right. The sky above is a mix of blue and wispy white clouds, with a digital data overlay in the top right corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the dirt road. The shed on the immediate left and the coniferous tree on the immediate right progressively recede and move out of the frame to the left and right, respectively, relative to their initial positions. This continuous forward motion brings the winding dirt road, the grassy hills, and the distant trees closer, revealing more of the expansive landscape and the horizon beyond the initial right-side tree.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a dirt road extending forward and gently curving to the right, flanked by a steep, lush green grassy slope on the left with visible rocks and diverse trees, including a dark wooden structure partially obscured in the far upper left. To the right, another grassy slope ascends, while a single bare tree stands on the left slope nearer the road's bend under a sky displaying long, wispy clouds. A translucent gray overlay in the top right corner displays "Time: 7:00 AM", "GRADE: 8%", and "DISTANCE: 6.0 KM".
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the dirt road, the dark wooden structure on the far upper left gradually exits the frame to the left, revealing more of the grassy hill that was previously behind it. Concurrently, the rocks on the left side of the road become closer and shift further left, the bare tree on the left slope also approaches, and the 'Time' and 'DISTANCE' values in the top right corner progressively decrease.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a dirt road extending from the viewer's foreground, winding through grassy hills. To the left, a steep slope covered with grass, rocks, and trees rises, while the right features a gentler grassy incline leading to distant hills under a sky with long, wispy white clouds. An informational overlay in the upper right corner displays "PACE 6:55 km," "RANGE 8%," "DISTANCE 6.0 KM," and a small map icon.
end of description
The environment remains static across all subsequent frames. The sole dynamic change visible is the "PACE" value in the upper-right overlay, which chronologically increases from 6:55 km to 7:00 km, then to 7:05 km, 7:10 km, and finally stabilizes at 7:20 km from the seventh frame onwards.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a winding, unpaved dirt road stretches from the viewer's foreground, curving slightly to the right and then left as it ascends a gentle slope. To the viewer's immediate left, a grassy hill, dotted with some dry patches and darker soil, slopes upwards, eventually meeting a dense forest of bare-branched trees and evergreens. On the right, another grassy hillside rises, featuring a prominent bare-branched tree near the road's curve, with more trees and distant hills visible further right. Overarching the scene is a sky with dramatic, elongated white clouds across a blue expanse, while a semi-transparent data overlay appears in the top right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the dirt road, causing the surrounding grassy hillsides and trees to shift backward relative to the initial viewpoint. The road itself appears to approach the curve ahead. The overlay in the top right corner dynamically updates its "Pace" value, changing from 7:20 /km to 7:35 /km, while "Asc" and "Dist" remain constant. No new objects are revealed behind or significantly to the sides, only a progression through the existing landscape.
