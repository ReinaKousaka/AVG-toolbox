In the first frame, a wet, cobbled street curves from the foreground left towards the center. To the immediate left is a green garbage bin. Dominating the midground is a dark-colored corner building housing "The Black Rose Tavern," with large windows displaying a purple interior glow, an arched entrance adorned with a lantern, and outdoor seating with black tables and chairs to its right. Further right, a group of people walk away from the viewer on a paved sidewalk, next to a large wooden planter with a small tree. The background features a street extending into the distance, lined with buildings and overhead string lights.

As the frames progress, the group of people on the right sidewalk continue walking deeper into the scene, gradually moving further from the viewer. A person emerges from the entrance of "The Black Rose Tavern," briefly standing just outside the doorway relative to the viewer. The wet pavement in the foreground and midground subtly reflects the light, creating minor shimmering shifts.
