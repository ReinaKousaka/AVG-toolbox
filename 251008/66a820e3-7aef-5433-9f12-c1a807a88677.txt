The first frame shows a massive tree trunk, adorned with a shimenawa rope and white paper streamers near its top, centrally dominating the view. To the viewer's left, stone steps ascend towards a white tent-like structure, while a miniature shrine-like object and a wooden sign are positioned at the tree's base and to its right. Dense green forest foliage and trees surround the scene, with an overcast sky visible above.

The camera then steadily pans upwards, gradually revealing more of the tree trunk's height above the initial shimenawa placement. Consequently, the shrine-like object and sign at the tree's base move out of view below the frame, and the white tent on the left also descends out of sight, while the tree's canopy and higher parts of the surrounding forest become newly visible at the top.
