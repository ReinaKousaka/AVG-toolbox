The first frame shows the viewer standing on a city sidewalk covered by scaffolding, featuring prominent metal poles on both sides and wooden planks overhead. In the immediate foreground, a person in a white short-sleeved shirt and dark pants stands with their back to the viewer. To the viewer's left, a black limousine and a motorcycle are parked next to buildings, while further ahead, another person in a light blue shirt faces the street. To the right of the viewer and extending into the midground, a busy street with cars, white crosswalks, and a red bike lane is visible, bordered by tall, modern glass buildings, with more city buildings fading into the distant background under a clear sky.
end of description
The person in the foreground immediately begins walking forward, away from the viewer along the sidewalk. Their legs and torso actively move, progressing steadily under the scaffolding. Concurrently, several pedestrians further ahead, in the midground and to the left of the walking person, also continue their movement. Vehicles on the street to the right of the walking person show subtle shifts in their positions, indicating ongoing traffic. The central figure continues to walk away from the viewer through subsequent frames, becoming slightly smaller as they recede into the distance.
