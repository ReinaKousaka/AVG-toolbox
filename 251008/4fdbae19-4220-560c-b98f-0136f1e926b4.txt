The first frame presents a train's-eye view looking down two sets of tracks into the distance. A tunnel entrance is visible ahead on the left, flanked by a steep, tree-covered mountain and a concrete wall with a fence. To the right, a body of water stretches towards distant hills under a cloudy sky, with overhead power lines extending above the tracks.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, steadily approaching the tunnel entrance. The concrete wall and fence to the left become noticeably closer and more extensive, while the small building on the hillside appears to move higher and slightly more into view relative to the ground. The tunnel entrance slowly enlarges as the train advances towards it.

The first frame shows a view from a train looking forward along two sets of parallel train tracks. In the immediate foreground, two railway tracks extend towards a distant tunnel entrance. To the left, a concrete wall topped with a chain-link fence runs alongside the tracks, with a yellow house and a densely forested, steep hillside visible behind it. To the right, another set of tracks runs parallel, beyond which a concrete barrier separates the railway from a body of water, with distant green hills and houses visible across it. Overhead, numerous electrical wires are suspended by poles lining both sides of the tracks, leading towards the dark tunnel opening in the mid-ground on the left track.

As the viewpoint moves forward, the concrete wall, fence, and forested hillside on the left appear closer and then recede to the left, revealing more of the terrain. Electrical poles and overhead wires continually emerge from the distant sky, approach the viewer, and then pass behind. The tunnel entrance, initially in the mid-ground ahead, steadily grows larger as the perspective moves towards it. Simultaneously, the right-hand track and the water body with distant hills smoothly shift from the mid-ground to the foreground as they pass the viewpoint.

The first frame displays two sets of train tracks extending forward into the distance, with the viewer seemingly positioned on the left-most track. To the left, a verdant hillside covered in trees slopes upward towards a rocky mountain face, where a dark tunnel entrance is visible further ahead, curving slightly to the left. To the right, parallel tracks run alongside a body of water, bordered by utility poles and distant mountains under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the video progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the central tracks, causing the tunnel entrance ahead to steadily grow larger and closer. The surrounding landscape, including the grassy hillside to the left and the lake to the right, continuously approaches from the midground and then recedes behind the viewer as the train advances towards the tunnel.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, two sets of railroad tracks laid on gravel extend from the viewer into the midground, curving slightly to the left. Straight ahead, a dark tunnel entrance is visible, with a red signal light to its right and a pole with a sign to its left; several utility poles with overhead wires flank the tracks. To the left, a grassy embankment covered with trees slopes up to a steep, dark grey rock face, while to the right, beyond a third track, a concrete barrier and distant green hills with small buildings are visible under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, causing all objects in the foreground and midground to grow larger and closer. The tunnel entrance, utility poles, and signal lights steadily approach the viewer's position. Distant hills and buildings to the right remain visible but appear to shift slightly relative to the moving viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The viewer looks ahead down two sets of train tracks, leading towards a dark tunnel entrance in the mid-distance. To the left, a grassy embankment rises to a road with a white guardrail and a red 50 km/h speed limit sign, while to the right, utility poles support overhead lines and a signal post displays a red light near the tunnel. A steep, tree-covered mountain forms the background on the left, contrasting with distant hills and a few small buildings on the right under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the camera moves forward along the tracks, all visible objects, including the tunnel entrance, signal, and surrounding landscape, progressively move closer to the first-frame viewpoint. The red signal light positioned to the right of the tunnel entrance changes to green, indicating clearance for passage.
