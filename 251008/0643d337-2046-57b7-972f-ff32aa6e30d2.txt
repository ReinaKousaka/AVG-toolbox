The first frame depicts a wet city street scene under an overcast sky. On the left, a sidewalk runs alongside a closed storefront with grey roller shutters and posters, followed by an ornate cream-colored building further back. To the right, a parking meter and a pole with multiple street signs stand prominently, beside a partially visible white car. A white Tesla is centered on the wet street, with pedestrians walking away from the viewer on the left sidewalk towards a distant overhead archway, and tall city buildings with illuminated facades rising in the background.

As the frames progress, the camera slowly moves to the right relative to the initial viewpoint. This horizontal shift causes objects initially on the viewer's right, specifically the parking meter and the street pole, to progressively move left across the frame. Consequently, the signs attached to the street pole change, revealing a new sign with an arrow, and more of the white parked car to the right of the pole becomes visible.

The first frame displays a wet city street on an overcast day, extending into the distance between tall buildings. On the left, a sidewalk features a building with a large gray roll-down door, followed by an ornate lighter building with an arched entrance further down where pedestrians are visible. To the right, a white Tesla SUV is stopped in the foreground on the multi-lane road, with a dark sedan behind it and a white van partially visible further right, all against a backdrop of towering city architecture.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the white Tesla SUV remains largely stationary in the foreground. The dark sedan positioned directly behind the Tesla on the road slowly inches forward. Concurrently, the white van further down on the right side of the road also moves slightly forward. Pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue their movement, with some walking towards and others away from the viewer along the established path.

The first frame displays a rainy city street scene. A white Tesla Model Y is centrally positioned on the wet asphalt in the mid-ground, while on the left, a building entrance with an awning and pedestrians walking away are visible on the sidewalk. To the right, further down the street, a dark sedan and a white van are present alongside more pedestrians holding umbrellas, with towering city buildings in the background. end of description. Across the subsequent frames, the white Tesla, the dark sedan, and the white van all slowly move forward, receding further down the street from the initial viewpoint.

The first frame captures a rainy city street scene, with a white Tesla Model Y parked prominently in the foreground, slightly to the right of the center. To the left, an ornate building facade with an awning extends over a sidewalk populated by several pedestrians, while the wet street reflects vibrant streetlights and distant billboards. Tall urban buildings line both sides of the street, and a blue sedan is parked further down on the right.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the white Tesla in the foreground slowly drives forward and slightly right relative to the initial viewpoint, progressively revealing its "12M-295" front license plate. Simultaneously, the blue sedan positioned further down the street on the right also advances imperceptibly forward.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
A white Tesla is parked curbside, front-right, on a wet street reflecting city lights from distant buildings, including a prominent "Hard Rock" sign to the right and a "Harry Potter" sign further back. To the left, a grand building with an illuminated awning and blue barriers hosts people walking down the sidewalk, away from the viewer.
end of description
The white Tesla then begins to pull forward and left from its parked position, revealing the driver inside as it slowly drives out of the frame towards the left, showing more of the street where it was previously located.

The first frame displays a wet city street scene. In the foreground to the right, a white car is partially visible, parked facing away from the viewer. To the left foreground, several blue crowd barriers are stacked. A large building with columns and poster frames extends from the left, featuring an ornate, illuminated canopy under which several people are standing and walking on the wet sidewalk. A lamppost with a "NO STANDING ANYTIME" sign stands on the curb in the midground, with parked and moving cars beyond it on the street. In the background, tall buildings with illuminated signs and purple lighting dominate, and the wet street vividly reflects the colorful lights.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, people under the left canopy exhibit minor movements, shifting postures or taking small steps. Cars in the street's mid-ground move subtly, indicating ongoing traffic further down the road. By the seventh frame, a pedestrian holding an open black umbrella becomes visible on the distant right sidewalk, walking away from the viewer. The overall illumination of the wet street and reflections remains constant, although a slight brightening is perceptible towards the final frames.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a rainy city street scene under an evening sky. To the left, a grand building entrance with large white columns and a golden, illuminated canopy extends over a wet sidewalk where several people are gathered. A large portrait and a smaller poster are visible on the building's facade, while the street to the right reflects the vibrant lights of distant buildings and billboards, with the front quarter of a white car occupying the bottom right foreground.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera subtly pans to the right, gradually revealing more of the white car on the far right and expanding the view of the street and buildings beyond. The street sign pole in the mid-right shifts further left in the frame, while the reflections on the wet ground subtly morph. People on the sidewalk under the golden awning make minor movements, but no entirely new static objects are unveiled; rather, existing elements become more visible or shift within the scene.
