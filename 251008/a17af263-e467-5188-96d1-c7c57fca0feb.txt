The first frame displays a street view from a pedestrian's perspective on a sidewalk, bordered on the left by a light-colored building wall with utility boxes, transitioning to a dark building facade further ahead. On the sidewalk, a red McDonald's delivery scooter is parked next to people, while a green hedge runs along the right, separating the path from a street where an orange bus, cars, and other delivery scooters are visible in the distance.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly shifts forward and slightly to the right, causing the initial light-colored wall and utility boxes to exit the left side of the frame. This movement reveals more of the dark building's facade on the left and increasingly brings further sidewalk activity, including more red delivery scooters and distant vehicles on the street, into view relative to the initial position.

In the first frame, a grey utility box occupies the immediate foreground on the left. Adjacent to it, a dark grey building wall with a partial yellow McDonald's logo runs along the left, with a red three-wheeled McDonald's delivery scooter parked against it, attended by two delivery personnel in red vests. On the right, an older pedestrian in a light grey top and blue jeans walks towards the viewer on the sidewalk, behind whom a street features an orange bus, other delivery scooters, and trees lining the background.
end of description
The camera subtly shifts forward and pans slightly right. The older pedestrian continues moving closer on the right sidewalk, eventually exiting the frame to the viewer's left. A black car on the street, initially partially obscured, becomes more prominent and moves forward, while the two delivery personnel on the left remain largely stationary. The overall perspective gradually widens to show more of the distant street.

The first frame displays a street scene with a red McDonald's delivery scooter and a person in a red uniform on the left, adjacent to a building with prominent yellow "M" arches. To the right, an elderly person walks towards the viewer, passing a red delivery cart on the street, beyond which an orange bus and a black car are visible moving along the road, separated from the sidewalk by a green hedge. The sidewalk in the midground is populated with pedestrians walking away from the viewer, while tall buildings and trees line the street in the background.
end of description
Over the following frames, the elderly person on the right moves closer to the viewer, partially obscuring the delivery cart, while the person in the red uniform on the left shifts position, facing slightly more away. The orange bus on the street slowly progresses, revealing more of a 'no entry' sign on its side, and the black car on the far right also advances slightly.

The first frame presents a street scene with a McDonald's on the left, featuring a red delivery scooter and queuing customers, while a street on the right contains an orange bus, cars, and a golf cart-like vehicle, separated by a green bush barrier and a white pole in the immediate right foreground.
end of description
As the frames progress, the orange bus on the street slowly moves towards the right from its initial position, gradually revealing more of its rear and the street behind it. Concurrently, a red 'no pedestrian' sign, initially partly obscured behind the white pole in the foreground right, becomes fully visible and shifts further to the right of the pole as the bus continues its movement.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a busy city street with a red McDonald's delivery scooter parked on the far left. A sidewalk on the left is bustling with pedestrians walking away from the viewer, paralleling a building with storefronts including a McDonald's. On the right, an orange bus adorned with animal graphics moves down a road, separated from the sidewalk by green bushes, with a prominent red 'no pedestrian' sign in the immediate foreground right. end of description
Throughout the following frames, the orange bus steadily recedes into the background along the road, continuously moving further away from the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the pedestrians on the sidewalk continue their walk, progressing deeper into the scene's background.
