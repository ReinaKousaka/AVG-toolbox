The first frame shows a multi-lane city road extending forward from the viewer, flanked by trees and tall buildings under a clear sky; a large red building is prominent on the left, with a white car in the leftmost lane and a navigation overlay in the top-left. Ahead on the road, a blue car and a silver minivan are visible among other traffic.

As the viewpoint moves forward, the navigation overlay in the top-left expands to display 'Jiefang East Road' and an intersection map, while all vehicles ahead progress further down the street.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a multi-lane city road stretching forward, bordered by tall buildings and green trees under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's left, a large red-orange building features a navigation overlay indicating "Jiefang East Road," while numerous vehicles are present in the lanes ahead and parked along the right side.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the surrounding buildings and trees to shift closer and then recede from the foreground. The navigation overlay on the left building dynamically updates, and vehicles ahead, including a white car in the far left lane, and those parked on the right, change their relative positions, indicating continuous movement down Jiefang East Road.

The first frame captures a multi-lane road extending into the distance, viewed from a low perspective. Yellow double lines and white lines mark the asphalt, flanked by rows of green trees and streetlights on both sides. To the left, a prominent red-orange building with small square windows rises, while various modern skyscrapers, including a very tall glass building, dominate the background on both sides of the road. A white van and a red car are visible in the distant center lanes, with a blue/white car parked on the right shoulder and a white car on the left. An informational graphic "Jiefang East Road" is overlaid in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the camera moves forward along the road, the white van and red car in the distance continue moving ahead. The blue/white car parked on the right and a white car on the left recede, indicating the viewer's progression. Subsequently, a white SUV parked further ahead on the right becomes more fully visible. A red bus also emerges into view in the far distance, remaining ahead of the viewer's moving vantage point.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a multi-lane urban road stretching into the distance under a clear blue sky. Directly ahead are a silver van, a dark sedan, and a white truck. To the immediate right, parked cars line the curb, with a white SUV closest to the viewer, followed by a white sedan and dark SUVs. A row of green trees runs along the right side of the road, and another patch of green foliage is on the left, next to a tall, reddish-brown building. In the background, numerous modern high-rise buildings, including a prominent glass skyscraper on the center-right, punctuate the skyline. A navigation overlay is visible in the top-left corner.
end of description
The viewer's perspective steadily moves forward along the road. The silver van, dark sedan, and white truck, initially ahead in the central lanes, continuously approach the viewer's original position. Simultaneously, the parked white SUV and other cars on the right side, initially to the viewer's right and slightly ahead, progressively recede and move behind the first-frame viewpoint as the camera advances. A white SUV, initially positioned in the distance on the left lane, gradually moves closer, eventually becoming parallel to the viewer's original location and then moving ahead to the viewer's left. New road sections and more distant cityscapes are continuously revealed ahead as the viewpoint progresses.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a multi-lane urban road extending into the distance, flanked by tall modern buildings and lush green trees on both sides. In the foreground and middle ground, a blue sedan occupies the leftmost lane, a silver minivan is in the middle lane ahead, and a dark gray sedan is in the right-center lane, all positioned to move away from the viewer. Several parked cars, including a dark SUV and a black sedan, are visible on the far right, with a partially obscured white car furthest right. A navigation overlay indicating "Jiefang East Road" is displayed in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly advances forward along the road. The blue sedan and silver minivan move further ahead, while a new white sedan gradually appears in the leftmost lane, behind the initial blue sedan's position, and also moves forward. The dark gray sedan in the right-center lane moves ahead, revealing more of the '公交' road marking on the asphalt. Additionally, a white car previously partially hidden on the far right fully emerges into view and proceeds forward, appearing closer to the viewer's original right-side position.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a multi-lane urban road extending into the distance under a clear blue sky. In the immediate foreground, white road markings are visible on the asphalt. To the viewer's left is a partially visible white sedan, directly in front is a dark gray sedan, and to the right, a black SUV is partially visible with a white box truck behind it. Further down the road, a white van and another white car are seen. Flanking the road on both sides are rows of green trees, behind which numerous tall, modern buildings with glass facades rise into the background, and a blue street sign with white text is high on the far left.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, all vehicles ahead move further into the distance, with road markings shifting towards the viewer and out of frame. The black SUV on the right advances, gradually revealing a white car that was previously behind it and to the viewer's right. Concurrently, a green and blue navigation overlay appears and expands in the upper left corner, providing directional information and street names.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a sunny city street from a forward-moving vehicle's perspective, featuring a dark grey sedan directly ahead and a white sedan to its right, parallel to the viewer on the rightmost lane. The asphalt road, marked with double yellow lines, is flanked by rows of green trees and tall modern buildings that recede into the distance on both sides, all under a clear blue sky. A navigation interface is overlaid in the top-left corner.
end of description.
As the viewer's vehicle advances, the dark grey sedan and the white sedan ahead progressively move further away relative to the initial viewpoint. New sections of the urban landscape, including additional buildings, trees, and road segments, are continuously revealed directly in front and then move past to the sides.
