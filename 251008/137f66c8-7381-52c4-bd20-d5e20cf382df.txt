The first frame displays a paved road curving slightly rightward into an underpass directly ahead of the viewer. To the left, a concrete retaining wall borders a grassy field, behind which distant mountains rise under a clear blue sky with scattered clouds. On the right, a marked bicycle path runs alongside another concrete wall, featuring a large tree and a white directional sign positioned further right. A bridge structure for what appears to be a railway line crosses horizontally above the underpass in the midground.

As the camera moves forward into the underpass, the road's white markings and the bicycle path on the right pass out of view beneath the viewer, while the concrete walls on both sides become increasingly prominent and closer. The directional sign and blue pedestrian/cyclist sign on the right move out of the frame as the tunnel entrance fills the view. A white car emerges from the far end of the underpass, approaching the viewer in the distance.

The viewer is positioned on an asphalt road leading into an underpass, flanked by tall concrete retaining walls. On the immediate left, a black and white striped bollard stands on a sidewalk next to a solid white road line, with a yield sign partially visible behind it. The road ahead has yellow dashed lines and appears somewhat damp in patches, leading towards a concrete overpass. Beyond the left wall are green fields, a fence, and distant mountains under a bright blue sky, while the right wall is topped with lush green bushes and trees, with a street lamp pole visible.
end of description
The viewpoint advances forward along the road, causing the striped bollard and yield sign on the left to progressively move closer to the bottom-left edge and eventually out of frame. The damp patches on the asphalt and the yellow dashed lines appear to recede as the viewer approaches the concrete overpass. The underpass structure and the surrounding landscape, including the mountains, remain ahead, gradually increasing in size and detail as if being driven towards.
