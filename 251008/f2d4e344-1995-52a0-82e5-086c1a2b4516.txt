The first frame shows a snow-covered street extending into the distance, flanked by buildings with snow-laden awnings on both the left and right, leading towards distant snow-capped mountains under a pale sky. In the foreground, a pedestrian crossing is visible, with snow banks lining the road's edges; a white van with illuminated headlights is centrally positioned on the street, while a green traffic light hangs overhead to the left.
end of description
In the following frames, the traffic light to the left changes from green to red. Concurrently, the white van on the road ahead begins to move forward and gradually recedes into the distance, driving away from the viewer down the street.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a snow-covered street extending into the distance, with a crosswalk directly in front of the viewer. Large banks of snow line both sides of the road in the foreground, particularly prominent on the left. Multi-story buildings with snow-laden roofs and covered walkways flank the street, receding into the midground, where a few parked cars and distant traffic are visible. In the background, a large, snow-covered mountain range rises under a pale, overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the foreground snow banks recede to the sides, revealing more of the covered walkways and storefronts on both the left and right. A pedestrian briefly appears and moves past a green traffic light on the left, which itself rises and exits the frame, while a white van on the right also recedes. The crosswalk beneath the viewer and distant elements along the road draw nearer as the scene progresses.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
A snow-covered street extends forward, bordered by buildings with snow-laden roofs and covered arcades on both sides, leading towards a distant, majestic snow-covered mountain range; large snow piles are prominent in the immediate foreground, with parked vehicles and a red mailbox visible along the street.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily progresses forward along the street. The large snow pile on the immediate left shrinks and moves out of the frame as the perspective shifts. A silver SUV previously parked on the left comes closer, revealing two individuals standing next to it. Concurrently, a white van parked on the right also moves closer into the viewer's vicinity. The storefronts on both sides become more distinct, and a "Yamamoto" sign on the right-side building is clearly revealed.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a winter street scene, viewed from a low perspective. A two-lane road, marked with faint lines, extends directly away from the viewer towards the snowy mountains in the far background. On the immediate left, a silver SUV is parked beside a snow-dusted sidewalk that runs under a covered walkway, part of a building complex. On the right, a white minivan is parked similarly, with a darker car behind it, fronting another row of buildings with covered walkways and snow-covered roofs. Utility poles with overhead wires line both sides of the street, leading the eye towards the distant, snow-covered mountains beneath a pale sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the street, the silver SUV on the immediate left gradually moves out of the frame to the left, revealing more of the storefronts. Simultaneously, the white minivan on the right and the darker sedan behind it move out of view to the right. The buildings lining both sides of the street appear closer, and the overall scene shifts as the viewer moves deeper into the town, with the snowy mountains in the background slowly changing perspective.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a snow-dusted street flanked by rows of buildings with heavy snow accumulated on their roofs and awnings, receding into the distance. In the far background, snow-covered mountains are visible under a pale sky. A dark minivan is parked on the left side of the road, facing away from the viewer, and several vehicles with illuminated headlights are seen further down the street.
end of description
The dark minivan on the left activates its right turn signal, then pulls out from its parked position and moves forward into the road relative to the viewer's fixed position. It continues driving, drawing progressively closer to the viewer and gradually obscuring the buildings on the immediate left.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a snowy street scene looking forward towards distant snow-covered mountains. A dark car partially occupies the bottom-left foreground, while a two-lane road stretches into the midground. Buildings with heavily snow-laden roofs and overhanging awnings line both sides of the street, with parked cars visible along the curbs and several people walking on the left sidewalk. Utility poles and overhead wires crisscross the sky, and distant cars with illuminated headlights are visible further down the road.

end of description

The camera moves forward consistently throughout the subsequent frames. The dark car in the bottom-left foreground progressively moves out of view, eventually disappearing entirely. Buildings and parked cars on both sides of the street appear to draw closer, revealing more of their lower facades and details along with additional cars parked further along the right side of the road. The distant cars with illuminated headlights also gradually approach the viewer, while the snow-covered mountain range in the background remains largely stationary relative to the viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a snow-lined street receding into the distance, flanked by buildings with snow-covered awnings. On the left, a white car and a green car are parked next to a covered walkway; on the right, two vans are parked along a similar walkway, with a fire hydrant visible. In the background, a large snow-covered mountain rises under a pale sky, with utility poles overhead.
end of description
Subsequently, the white car on the left activates its brake lights and then drives forward, turning left and exiting the frame from the viewer's left side. A person briefly appears walking behind the moving car, but no other significant elements change position or are newly revealed.
