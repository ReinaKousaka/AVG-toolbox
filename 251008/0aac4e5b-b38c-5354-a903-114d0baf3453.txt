In the first frame, a crosswalk is directly ahead, leading to an asphalt road that curves slightly left. To the left, a raised planter with green plants and a tree trunk borders the road, while a blue taxi is visible further ahead. On the right, a multi-tiered dark staircase ascends to a large building featuring brick-red and glass sections, with several people on the steps and flags flying near the entrance. Distant green hills and a blue sky with white clouds are in the background.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the crosswalk to recede. A colorful, graffiti-covered building is gradually revealed on the far left behind the planter, and a street light pole appears on the right sidewalk. People on the stairs on the right continue their movement, while the blue taxi maintains its position ahead on the road.

The first frame presents a straight asphalt road extending into the distance, with a white dashed line down its center. To the viewer's immediate right, a sidewalk and dark brick stairs ascend towards a large brick and glass building adorned with Colombian flags, where a person in uniform is seen walking a dark dog down the stairs. A lamppost stands on the sidewalk to the right, while a raised median with lush greenery, including agave-like plants, runs along the left side, separating the road from yellow-painted buildings with murals. A blue car is visible driving away from the viewer in the mid-distance on the road, with trees and mountains dominating the background under a partially cloudy blue sky.

As the viewpoint progresses, the scene moves forward along the road. The person with the dog continues descending the stairs, eventually exiting the frame to the right, and the lamppost also moves closer before disappearing off-frame right. The blue car recedes further into the distance, while two new yellow pedestrian crossing signs become visible in the mid-ground, one on each side of the road. A "PARQUEADERO PÃšBLICO" billboard is revealed on the left behind the median as the brick building on the right becomes more prominent.

In the first frame, a paved road with a solid white line on the left and a zig-zag pattern in the middle extends towards the viewer. To the right, a sidewalk with a yellow curb borders a grassy area, a brick retaining wall, and ascending brick stairs, leading to a large brick building partially obscured by trees. A yellow diamond traffic light sign stands prominently on the right sidewalk, with a person visible ascending the stairs further back. On the left, a raised planter filled with foliage parallels the road, behind which a low brick wall and another brick building with a "PARQUEADERO PUBLICO" sign are visible, along with a matching yellow traffic light sign. Two blue cars are seen ahead in the distance, while a bright blue sky with scattered clouds fills the upper portion of the frame.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the two blue cars ahead recede further into the distance. The yellow traffic light signs on both sides move past the viewer, while the brick stairs and the person on them to the right disappear from view. A blue bus stop sign, initially behind the right traffic sign, becomes fully visible on the right side of the road. Finally, a circular manhole cover appears on the road ahead, moving towards the bottom of the frame, as the zig-zag road markings pass beneath the viewer.
