As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, new stretches of the road are continuously revealed ahead. Rocks and dense green foliage previously further along the path appear closer to the viewer on both the left and right sides before receding behind the viewer. A small waterfall or stream flowing down the hillside on the right side becomes visible as the view progresses, moving past the viewer.
