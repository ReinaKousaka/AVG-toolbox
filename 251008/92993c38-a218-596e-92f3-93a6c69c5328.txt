The first frame displays a wet, dark city street at night, with a reddish-brown brick sidewalk in the foreground featuring two black bollards. To the viewer's left, a rainy street has moving cars and large trees, while to the right, illuminated storefronts with a partially covered banner line the sidewalk where several people, one with a yellow umbrella, are visible further down.

The people on the sidewalk, including the individual with the yellow umbrella, steadily walk further away from the viewer, receding into the distance along the right side of the frame. As they advance, more of the wet sidewalk becomes visible behind them. Cars continue to move along the street to the left.

The first frame displays a rainy night on a city street with a wet, reddish-brown sidewalk reflecting various lights. In the immediate foreground are two dark bollards; further left, a large tree borders a wet street where a distant green traffic light is visible. Three individuals, holding clear, dark, and yellow umbrellas, walk away from the viewer down the center of the sidewalk, flanked by storefronts on the right.

As the frames progress, the two people with the clear and dark umbrellas walk past the left tree and towards the viewer, eventually exiting the frame to the left, while the person with the yellow umbrella continues walking away. A white car appears on the wet street, driving from behind the left tree and moving into the distance.

The first frame displays a rainy city street at night, with a wet brick sidewalk in the foreground reflecting numerous lights. On the left, a woman holding a clear umbrella walks toward the viewer, slightly behind a man with a dark grey umbrella who is also approaching the viewer. To their left, the sidewalk is lined with trees and streetlights, bordering a wet road where traffic lights (green) and distant vehicles are visible. Along the right side, a building facade with glass windows and wooden elements runs parallel to the sidewalk, where a person holding a bright lime green umbrella walks away from the viewer in the midground.
end of description
The woman with the clear umbrella and the man with the dark grey umbrella walk past and exit the frame to the viewer's left. Simultaneously, the person with the bright lime green umbrella visible in the midground continues walking further away from the viewer along the right sidewalk. As these figures recede, more of the wet, reflective brick sidewalk and the building facade on the right become visible in the cleared foreground. Vehicles continue to move along the wet road in the background to the left. The scene maintains its rainy night atmosphere, with illuminated reflections constantly shimmering on the wet surfaces.
