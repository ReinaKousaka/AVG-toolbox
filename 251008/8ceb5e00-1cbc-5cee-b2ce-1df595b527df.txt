The first frame displays a paved city sidewalk leading forward. To the viewer's left, a tree-lined street features parked bicycles and distant vehicles, while to the right, a building with various storefronts, including a '7-Eleven' partially covered by a striped material, lines the path. In the far background, towering skyscrapers are visible, and two pedestrians walk on the right side of the sidewalk towards the viewer.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves continuously forward along the sidewalk. The two pedestrians on the right side approach and then pass the original first-frame viewpoint, eventually moving out of frame to the right. Concurrently, the striped construction covering on the far right passes out of view behind the first-frame viewpoint, revealing more of the '7-Eleven' storefront and its "wowowo" signage. A person on a scooter/motorcycle in the middle distance also approaches the first-frame viewpoint on the road and passes by towards the left. All these changes demonstrate the viewer's ongoing forward movement through the scene.

The first frame displays a wide paved sidewalk stretching directly away from the viewer, bordered by brightly lit commercial storefronts on the right and a tree-lined street with parked bicycles on the left. In the mid-distance, a person on a scooter moves away along the left side of the path, while a woman walks away from the viewer on the far right foreground.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the path. The scooter rider continues further into the distance on the left, eventually becoming very small, while the woman on the right walks out of the frame. New pedestrians appear and move further down the path, some walking towards the viewer on the right side, as the shops and trees become closer.
