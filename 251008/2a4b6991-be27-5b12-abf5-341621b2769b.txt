The first frame shows a wet urban scene with a dual-lane road on the left, separated by a guardrail from a treed hill. To the viewer's right is a paved sidewalk, featuring a muddy puddle and two grey utility boxes on its left side, and a row of orange and white temporary barriers on its right. Beyond these barriers, a construction site with white hoarding and temporary structures is visible, leading up a hill. In the midground, the road and sidewalk lead towards a dark tunnel entrance under a treed hill, with a yellow triangular road sign and a red rectangular sign posted above the sidewalk.

Initially, a white car appears on the wet road to the viewer's left, moving away towards the tunnel entrance. This car proceeds further into the distance, and then a second white car becomes visible, following the first. As the initial car exits the frame further away, the second white car continues to drive away from the viewer. Subsequently, a third white car emerges, also traversing the road and moving further away from the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame presents a wet road and sidewalk scene under an overcast sky. To the immediate left, two large, light grey utility boxes are visible, partially obscured by green weeds at their base. Running along the right side is a row of orange and white plastic barriers, behind which a white construction hoarding stands. In the midground, a wet asphalt road stretches ahead, with a white guardrail further down its left side, leading towards two tunnels in the distance, within which two white cars are partially visible. A black utility pole with a yellow triangular "road narrows" sign is positioned between the road and a grassy strip, lined with several small green trees, next to a paved sidewalk featuring tactile paving strips on the right.

In the following frames, the two white cars on the wet road ahead progressively move further away from the viewer, driving towards and into the tunnels. As they proceed, the cars create visible splashes of water from the heavily saturated road surface. The amount of water pooling and rippling on the asphalt road ahead appears to increase, indicating ongoing rain and the impact of vehicle movement through the standing water.

A wet road and a parallel pedestrian path lead towards two distant tunnel entrances, with a guardrail and wooded embankment to the left and a grey wall on the far right. A utility pole featuring a yellow warning sign and an attached grey box stands on the path's edge in the mid-left foreground.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily advances forward along the path. The utility pole and sign, initially mid-left, recede further left and away from the viewer's original position. Simultaneously, a white bicycle symbol, previously further ahead on the path, emerges and approaches that same original position, while a white car passes on the road beyond, moving towards the tunnels, and the grey wall on the right extends closer.
