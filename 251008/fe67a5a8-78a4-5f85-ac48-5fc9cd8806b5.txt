In the first frame, a wet, reddish-brown brick sidewalk extends from the viewer into the distance on the right, flanked by a row of trees on the left. On the left, a rain-slicked street reflects vehicle lights and a green traffic light in the midground, with cars moving away from the viewer. On the right, a storefront with a brown awning and a large white banner featuring Korean text lines the sidewalk. Two black bollards with yellow tops are positioned on the sidewalk to the right, while a white plastic container sits at the base of the closest tree on the left. Two individuals holding umbrellas walk away from the viewer on the sidewalk: one with a yellow umbrella in the midground, and another with a clear umbrella further behind them.

The person with the yellow umbrella continues to walk further away from the viewer along the sidewalk. Additional pedestrians, also carrying umbrellas, emerge from behind the initial two and move away from the viewer. Vehicles on the street to the left proceed further into the distance, away from the viewer, as rain steadily falls.

The first frame shows a wet, reflective reddish-brown sidewalk at night, flanked by two black and yellow bollards in the foreground. To the left, a large tree trunk stands before a street, where a silver car drives past a green traffic light in the distance. On the right, storefronts with reflective glass and a partially visible white banner line the street. Four pedestrians, each holding an umbrella (clear, dark, and yellow), walk towards the viewer in the midground.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly moves forward and slightly to the right, causing the four pedestrians to advance past the viewer, growing larger and eventually passing the frame's center. Concurrently, the silver car on the wet street in the left background moves further down the road and out of view. More of the reflective storefronts and the white banner with Korean text on the right side of the frame become visible.

The first frame depicts a wet, brick sidewalk at night, where a man with a black umbrella and a woman with a clear umbrella walk towards the viewer in the foreground. To the right is a building with illuminated storefronts, while a street with traffic lights and trees stretches into the distance on the left, with another person holding a green umbrella walking away.
end of description
Subsequently, the man and woman move past the viewer and exit the frame to the left. The person with the green umbrella continues walking away further into the scene along the sidewalk, while cars briefly appear and pass on the wet road to the left of the sidewalk.
