The first frame displays a nocturnal city street scene with several pedestrians in the foreground; on the right, a person walks away from the viewer carrying an orange instrument case, while on the left, other individuals are gathered near a subway entrance railing. In the midground, a street with vehicles is visible, illuminated by a traffic light and overhead holiday decorations, flanked by a large building featuring a billboard on the left and a lighter-colored building with multiple windows and blue signs on the right.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly to the right, gradually revealing more of the street and the building on the right side. The person in the blue puffer jacket on the far left moves into the foreground and then out of the frame to the left, while the individual with the instrument case continues walking away from the viewer along the sidewalk. Concurrently, other pedestrians move through the midground, and a motorcycle prominently travels from the left midground across the street.

In the first frame, a street scene at night shows a person in a blue puffer jacket partially visible at the far left foreground. Immediately to their right, a man in a dark jacket stands facing slightly towards the viewer. On the right foreground, a person in a long grey coat with an orange instrument case on their back walks away from the viewer, parallel to a building on the right with vertical architectural features and two blue illuminated signs. In the midground, a street runs left to right with cars, a scooter, a traffic light (showing red for vehicles), and decorative string lights on trees and lamp posts. A large building with many windows and an advertisement on its facade dominates the left midground, with other buildings receding into the background.

Following frames show the man in the dark jacket walking past the viewer towards the left. Simultaneously, the person with the orange instrument case continues moving away along the right-side building. The scooter and various cars on the street also proceed forward, and the traffic light cycles from red to green and then back to red for the vehicles in the midground.
