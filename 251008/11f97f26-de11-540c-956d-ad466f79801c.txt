In the first frame, a towering building with striking red vertical lights and a large digital billboard displaying "95" and Chinese text at its base dominates the mid-right. A street light with an attached traffic light stands directly in front of this building. To the left, a less illuminated tall building rises, and further left, a residential-style building with numerous lit windows appears in the background, while the upper part of another building with an orange sign is visible on the far right.

The viewpoint slowly tilts upwards and slightly to the right, causing the digital billboard and traffic light to gradually move out of the frame below. This motion reveals more of the upper sections of the towering buildings, including the full height of the main building and an "ICBC" logo atop the adjacent building on the far right. The residential building on the far left simultaneously recedes from view.
