The first frame shows a snow-covered mountain village scene with a large, snow-laden evergreen tree centrally positioned in the mid-ground. Behind it to the left stands an orange house with a blue awning and snow-covered roof, while the heavily snow-covered roof edge of a wooden building occupies the foreground right. A snowy road curves into the mid-ground left, where a person in blue walks away from the viewer, beneath a lamppost and decorative lights, with snow-capped mountains rising in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the person in blue continues walking along the snowy path to the mid-ground left, gradually moving further away from the viewer and eventually exiting the frame. Concurrently, the view slightly shifts to the right, revealing more of the wooden building's facade on the foreground right, including a window adorned with lights and a visible 'Eingang' sign near its base.
