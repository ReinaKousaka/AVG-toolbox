In the first frame, a rainy city street at night extends into the distance, obscured by mist. In the foreground, a prominent tree trunk is positioned slightly right of center, with a wet sidewalk to its right, where a stack of white bags rests beside a utility box, and illuminated storefronts line the far right. To the left of the tree, a wet road with yellow and white markings reflects the distant lights, with a black car visible in the midground on the right side of the road, and other vehicles with bright headlights further down the street, all enveloped in heavy rain.

The black car on the right side of the road in the midground reverses and moves out of frame by the third image. Subsequently, the viewpoint shifts right, causing the foreground tree to exit the frame on the left, revealing more of the sidewalk, the utility box, and illuminated storefronts on the right side of the street relative to the initial perspective.

The viewer is positioned on a wet city sidewalk at night during a heavy downpour. To the immediate left, a stack of white-wrapped items sits next to a light-colored utility box. Beyond this, a rain-soaked street extends into the hazy distance with approaching vehicle headlights and a line of trees, one bearing a "BUS" sign. To the right, the wet sidewalk continues forward, bordered by a raised planter filled with illuminated green bushes, while buildings with glowing signs line the far right, all fading into the rain-obscured background.

Throughout the frames, heavy rain dynamically splashes and creates ripples across the wet ground, particularly visible in front and slightly to the right of the viewer. A dark sedan gradually becomes more defined on the street to the viewer's left, slowly moving deeper into the scene. The intensity of the rain continues to obscure the distant city lights to the left, and a "Rain Everyday" watermark appears in the bottom-left corner of the view from the second frame onward.

The viewer observes a rainy city street at night from a sidewalk, looking down the wet thoroughfare. In the foreground left are a tree trunk, a bus stop sign, and a utility box, while on the right, a low planter with illuminated green shrubs precedes a building facade. Mid-ground left shows a black car parked on the street with bicycles and more trees, as distant city lights and traffic signals pierce the heavy rain.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera subtly pans right and slightly zooms out, gradually revealing a large vertical advertisement on the building facade to the right of the shrubs, featuring a person's face that becomes increasingly visible. The heavy rain and overall scene remain consistent.
