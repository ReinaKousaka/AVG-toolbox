The first frame shows a multi-lane urban road under a cloudy sky. In the foreground, a row of orange and white striped traffic barriers runs down the center of the road, leading away from the viewer. To the immediate left, there's a sidewalk with green bushes and a large tree partially visible. A silver car is stopped in the lane to the left of the barriers, facing away, while a pedestrian walks towards the viewer between the silver car and the barriers. To the right, another dark grey car is stopped at an intersection, facing right. In the midground, various buildings, including one under scaffolding to the left and a large, older building centrally, are visible, along with multiple traffic lights and street signs.
end of description
A black car progressively enters the frame from the bottom left, moving away from the viewer and to the left of the traffic barriers. This newly revealed car travels along the left lane, passing the viewer. The silver car ahead remains stationary in its lane, as does the dark grey car at the intersection. The pedestrian continues walking further down the road, to the left of the traffic barriers.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a multi-lane city street under an overcast sky, with a black SUV stopped ahead and to the left of the viewer, its brake lights illuminated, next to a green hedge and a utility box. Red and white striped construction barriers are to the right of the viewer's lane, leading to an intersection with traffic lights, where a white car is also stopped.
end of description
Subsequently, the traffic light ahead turns green, and the black SUV and white car proceed forward from their initial positions, with the SUV's right turn signal activating. A pedestrian continues walking across the street ahead, from right to left, and a bicyclist later emerges from the right to cross the intersection ahead.

The first frame captures a street scene: In the foreground, green bushes and two poster-displaying kiosks are on the left, while a black car is stopped directly in front of the viewer, flanked by red and white traffic barriers on the far right. A large, leafy tree dominates the upper left and center, above which lies an overcast sky. In the midground, behind the car, a green traffic light and a yellow directional sign stand, with pedestrians and cyclists crossing further right; buildings, including one with scaffolding, line the background.
end of description
Over the subsequent frames, the black car directly in front of the viewer begins to move forward, steadily driving away. This motion progressively reveals more of the road ahead and the green traffic light, while the white car previously behind it also moves forward and eventually exits the frame to the right. Concurrently, people and cyclists on the right side of the road continue to advance, moving past the red and white traffic barriers away from the viewer's fixed position.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, an advertisement kiosk with a poster is immediately to the lower left of the viewer, behind which a dense green bush extends towards the mid-ground. A large tree trunk is situated further back on the left, with its canopy visible overhead. Centrally positioned, a black car is directly in front of the viewer on the road, while to its right, a red and white striped construction barrier marks a bicycle path. Further ahead, an intersection with green traffic lights and a yellow directional signpost is visible, with multiple buildings and another large tree in the background under a cloudy sky.
end of description
The black car directly in front of the viewer steadily moves forward, approaching the intersection. Concurrently, the cyclist to the right of the black car moves further back and eventually disappears from the frame. A white car subsequently appears behind the black car, crossing the intersection before turning right and exiting the scene. Simultaneously, a yellow flashing light activates on the right side of the construction barrier, and a yield sign becomes fully visible ahead at the intersection.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays an urban intersection under an overcast sky. In the immediate foreground to the bottom left are green bushes and a grey utility box with a poster, while the road, marked with a white crosswalk and dashed lines, occupies the center. A black SUV is stopped in the mid-ground, facing away, with a cyclist and a white car visible further back to its right. To the left of the SUV, a tall pole holds a green traffic light with an upward arrow and a red yield sign, with multi-story buildings and trees in the background. On the far right, a yellow directional signpost lists destinations, accompanied by another green traffic light and a red and white striped barrier closer to the viewer.

end of description

The black SUV and the cyclist, initially in the mid-ground directly ahead, begin to move forward and further away from the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the red and white striped barrier to the right and the utility box to the left move out of frame as the viewpoint advances. The yellow directional signpost on the far right also moves past, revealing a new, tall building under construction further to the right. The overall perspective shifts, indicating the camera is moving forward through the intersection.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a gray street extends into the distance, marked with white dashed and solid lines. To the left, a metal pole holds a red inverted triangular yield sign, a green arrow traffic light below a circular red light, and a white rectangular U-turn sign indicating '200m'. A black car is positioned in the midground, facing away, with two cyclists to its right. Various buildings, including residential structures on the left and a large, multi-story building under construction on the far right, line the street, while trees are visible across the midground under a cloudy sky.

end of description

As the viewpoint gradually advances, the red yield sign and the green arrow on the left traffic light disappear, followed by the U-turn sign moving upwards and out of the frame. Concurrently, the circular red light on the left pole remains red as the entire pole and its visible blue arrow sign begin to shift leftward and upward, eventually leaving the frame. The black car and cyclists in the midground recede further into the distance along the street. The multi-story building on the far right becomes increasingly visible, revealing more of its structure as the scene progresses.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a multi-lane urban road under an overcast sky. To the immediate left, a curb borders a sidewalk, behind which stands a large, light-colored historic building with a dark roof and a black car parked in front. Centrally on the road, a black car is stopped facing away from the viewer, backed by a cluster of green trees and an advertisement pillar. To the right, two cyclists ride away from the viewer, preceding a tall, modern building with many windows and scaffolding.
end of description
The black car on the far left and the central black car, along with the two cyclists to the right, all begin to move forward, away from the first-frame viewpoint. A white car then emerges from the far left, traveling forward and eventually passing directly to the immediate left of the first-frame viewpoint before exiting the frame to the right. Simultaneously, the central black car and the two cyclists continue moving further away, while the viewer's perspective slightly shifts forward, revealing more of the distant left side of the street.
