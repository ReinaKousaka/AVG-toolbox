The first frame shows a snow-covered city street from a low, forward-facing perspective, with pedestrians walking away from the viewer on a white sidewalk. In the foreground, three individuals, two holding blue umbrellas, lead towards a distant urban landscape featuring a black taxi on the left street, bare trees along the right sidewalk, and tall buildings under an overcast sky.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the black taxi slowly advances forward on the left street, gradually revealing a "FITNESS 99" sign behind its initial position before it fully exits the frame to the left. Concurrently, the foreground pedestrians continue walking away, with new individuals appearing from the left side of the frame as the persistent snowfall continues.

In the first frame, a snowy city street scene unfolds under an overcast sky. In the immediate foreground to the left, a person is partially visible from behind, holding a large black umbrella and wearing a dark coat, with a "SEOUL WALKER" watermark at the bottom left. In the midground on the left, a black sedan taxi with a yellow roof light is parked on the snow-covered street, facing left, next to a building with multiple reflective windows. Centered in the midground, a person in a dark coat and hat walks away from the viewer on the snowy sidewalk. To the right of them, a group of people walk towards the viewer on the same sidewalk, some holding blue umbrellas, and the street extends into the distance lined with bare trees and tall buildings.
end of description
As the frames progress, the foreground person holding the black umbrella slowly moves forward and slightly to the right, gradually revealing more of the street. The person in the midground center continues walking further away, deeper into the scene, while the group on the right sidewalk moves closer to the viewer before passing out of view to the left. A red bus then appears in the distant background on the right side of the street, followed by a white truck, both driving towards the viewer. The black sedan taxi on the left remains largely stationary throughout.

In the first frame, a person wearing a dark blue winter jacket with a fur-lined hood and holding a dark blue umbrella is positioned in the lower-left foreground, seen from behind. To their left, a dark sedan is partially visible on a snow-covered street. In the midground, a group of pedestrians, some holding umbrellas, walk away from the viewer on a snowy sidewalk, with a red bus visible further down the street to the right. In the background, modern buildings rise on both sides of the street under an overcast sky, with bare trees lining the right side of the sidewalk.

end of description

The person in the foreground with the umbrella slowly advances forward and slightly to the right, revealing more of the dark sedan to their left, which is identified as a taxi by a visible yellow sign. Simultaneously, the group of pedestrians and the red bus in the midground move further away from the first-frame viewpoint and to the right. A woman previously partially obscured on the far right becomes more visible as she walks across the street further into the scene. As the foreground advances, a "FITNESS 101" sign on a building to the left becomes newly discernible. Snow continues to fall gently throughout the scene.

The first frame depicts a snowy city street from a pedestrian's forward-looking perspective, with a person in a dark coat holding a black umbrella centrally in the immediate foreground, facing away from the viewer, and a partial dark car on the far left. To their right, another person with a blue umbrella and a third walker are seen further ahead, all on a snow-covered sidewalk that includes a cleared crosswalk, bordered by tall buildings and bare trees. end of description
As the sequence unfolds, the viewpoint steadily moves forward, causing the foreground individuals to walk away. The red bus, initially visible on the right, recedes further down the street and eventually exits the frame, revealing more distant pedestrians becoming increasingly clear on the left sidewalk as the camera advances through the urban scene.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a snowy city street scene from a first-person perspective, with snow covering the sidewalk and ground extending away from the viewer. Three individuals, carrying umbrellas and wearing dark winter coats, walk away from the viewer down the center, left-midground, and right-midground of the snow-dusted sidewalk, accompanied by yellow-topped bollards. Tall modern buildings rise on both sides of the street, with bare trees lining the sidewalk under a grey, overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the three primary pedestrians steadily move further away from the first-frame viewpoint, continuing down the snow-covered street. More individuals gradually become visible walking further along the sidewalk, also moving away from the viewer, while snow continues to fall throughout the evolving urban scene.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a snowy city street, with pedestrians walking away from the viewer on a partially cleared sidewalk covered in slush, many holding umbrellas. Central in the foreground is the back of a person in a dark coat and black umbrella, with black-and-yellow bollards to the left and right, a tall glass building on the far left, bare snow-dusted trees, and a distant multi-story building to the right.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint advances along the sidewalk, causing pedestrians to shift positions and objects further down the street to become more prominent. A turquoise telephone booth on the right mid-ground becomes fully visible, while new pedestrians with umbrellas continually enter the frame from the left, moving forward. Throughout the frames, snow visibly falls, maintaining the wintry atmosphere as the urban landscape gradually unfolds.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a snow-covered urban sidewalk stretches from the foreground into the distance, lined by tall buildings and bare trees. Closest to the viewer, a person in a dark winter coat with a fur-trimmed hood, holding a black umbrella, walks away. To their immediate left, partially visible, is another person under a blue umbrella, also walking away from the viewer. On the left, a modern building with large glass windows displays a "STARBUCKS" sign and a glowing yellow Christmas tree inside, while on the right, a snow-dusted street runs parallel to the sidewalk, featuring a light blue public phone booth and a few distant cars. The sky above is overcast.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the snowy sidewalk. The foreground person in the dark coat and others ahead of the viewer gradually move further away, revealing more of the street and the building to the left, where the Christmas tree becomes more prominent. A new pedestrian in a white jacket with a dark backpack is revealed further down the sidewalk, walking away, as the blue phone booth on the right moves comparatively to the right of the frame, indicating the viewer is passing it.
