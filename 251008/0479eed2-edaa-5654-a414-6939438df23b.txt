The first frame displays a wet sidewalk extending into the hazy distance, with a black fence, green foliage, and tall trees lining the left, and a gray utility box positioned beside the fence. To the right, a low hedge, more trees, a blue pedestrian/bicycle sign, and a wet road with a white line are visible.

Throughout the subsequent frames, continuous rain causes the surrounding trees to gently sway, while a lone figure gradually emerges walking down the distant sidewalk. Concurrently, vehicles, including a car and a truck, are revealed passing on the wet road to the right, moving from the far distance towards the viewer.
