The first frame depicts a dark, rainy night on a narrow street, with a traditional-style wall and utility pole occupying the left foreground. To the right, a tall white construction barrier with visible scaffolding extends forward, partially obscuring a building and a lit window in the mid-ground. Falling raindrops are illuminated by a streetlight further down the wet road, with additional distant lights visible in the background.
end of description
As frames progress, the rainfall intensifies, making the individual raindrops more distinct under the streetlights. Concurrently, streaks of water become clearly visible flowing down the white construction barrier on the right, indicating increased wetness from the continuous precipitation, all from the consistent first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame captures a dark, rainy night on a street, with a traditional building featuring a tiled roof and patterned wall visible on the far left. A utility pole with a bright streetlamp stands in the left foreground, casting light on the falling rain and the wet asphalt road that extends into the distance. On the right, a tall, white corrugated metal fence occupies the foreground, beyond which a brick building with a visible window can be seen. Further down the street, a second, fainter streetlamp illuminates more rain, and a low white railing is visible on the left side of the road.
end of description
The subsequent frames depict the continuous, steady fall of rain across the entire scene, most notably visible as illuminated streaks under the two streetlights. The individual raindrops and their visible paths dynamically change in each frame, creating a sense of ongoing precipitation. The overall static composition of the buildings, street, and viewpoint remains constant, with only the dynamic rain providing movement.

The first frame depicts a dark, rainy street at night. To the viewer's left, a patterned white wall with a tiled roof is visible, along with a black and yellow striped utility pole in the foreground. The wet asphalt road with yellow markings extends into the distance, bordered on the left by a white railing and on the right by a tall white corrugated wall, behind which a brick building stands further back.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the scene remains spatially static, with no new objects or scenes revealed relative to the initial viewpoint. The sole dynamic change observed is the continuous, heavy rain falling across the illuminated street, causing subtle shifts in reflections on the wet ground from distant light sources.
