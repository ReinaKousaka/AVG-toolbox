The first frame displays a nighttime street scene under rain. On the left, a sidewalk features brightly lit storefronts with large windows. A large, dark tree trunk stands prominently in the mid-ground, slightly left of center. The wet street, reflecting red and green traffic lights in the distance, extends forward from behind the tree. To the right of the street, a light-colored building and bare trees are visible in the background.

The viewpoint gradually shifts left and slightly forward across the subsequent frames. The prominent dark tree trunk moves to a more central position, appearing larger and progressively obscuring more of the street in the distance. Simultaneously, more of the brightly illuminated storefronts and the sidewalk on the left are revealed. A white advertising stand with blue text and a "1+1" promotion, previously hidden behind the tree, emerges fully visible to the right of the tree trunk on the sidewalk. A "Rain Everyday" watermark is also introduced in the bottom-left corner starting from the second frame.

The first frame captures a rainy city street at night, featuring a brightly lit white arched display on the far left of a building, and a wet cobblestone street extending into the distance. On the right, a black pole holds a white advertising sign displaying photos and text, while distant streetlights and traffic signals reflect on the ground, illuminating the dark urban background.

The camera slowly pans right, causing the white arched display to move out of the frame on the left, revealing more of the adjacent dark storefront and its wooden door. Simultaneously, the advertising sign on the right also moves out of view, opening up the foreground to a yellow tactile paving strip. This wider perspective on the wet street reveals a person under an umbrella in the mid-ground right. The steady rainfall continues throughout the sequence.

The first frame captures a rainy night on a city street from a sidewalk perspective. To the immediate left is a building facade with wooden panels and a partially open dark gate. The wet street stretches ahead, reflecting streetlights and traffic signals, flanked by buildings including a brightly lit display on the mid-left and a lighter building with distant people under umbrellas on the far right. end of description. As the scene progresses, the viewpoint slowly pans right and slightly zooms out. A black scooter becomes visible on the immediate left sidewalk, closer to the viewer than the initial gate, while more of the street scene is revealed further to the right of the original frame.
