The first frame presents a rainy street intersection viewed from a wet brick sidewalk with yellow tactile paving in the foreground; a white patio umbrella attached to a black pole stands in the mid-right, while a crosswalk extends from the lower-left, and a silver SUV is blurred moving left across the wet road in the mid-left, with buildings and traffic lights visible in the background.

The silver SUV visible in the first frame continues moving left across the crosswalk and exits the scene to the far left by the third frame. Simultaneously, a dark sedan, initially on the mid-right, proceeds left, passing the umbrella pole and traversing the intersection, eventually exiting left. Subsequently, a new dark car enters the frame from the right, approaching the crosswalk as the scene progresses. A "Rain Everyday" watermark also appears in the lower-left corner from the second frame onward.

The first frame displays a wet urban intersection under an overcast sky. In the foreground, a dark grey sedan moves left across a crosswalk with white stripes, its front half visible, while a striped pole with a traffic light is partially seen on the viewer's right. The midground features a wide, wet road leading into a city street lined with commercial buildings, including a dental clinic on the right, and trees. Traffic lights and street signs hang overhead, and tall apartment buildings extend into the background.

The initially visible dark grey sedan continues traversing the crosswalk, moving across the viewer's immediate left vision and exiting to the left by frame four. Subsequently, a light-colored sedan emerges from the far right side of the road and begins moving across the midground towards the left by frame seven. In the later frames, a different dark grey sedan enters from the bottom left, crossing the foreground crosswalk towards the viewer's right. The background buildings and overcast conditions remain consistent throughout.
