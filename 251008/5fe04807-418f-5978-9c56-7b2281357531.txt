The first frame displays a paved road curving slightly right into the midground, bordered by buildings and parked vehicles. To the left, a multi-story chalet with wooden balconies sits on a grassy slope, with a white SUV and a grey car parked nearby along the road. On the right, a row of parked cars faces away from the viewer on a paved lot, beyond which a majestic snow-capped mountain dominates the distant background under a clear blue sky.

In subsequent frames, cars parked on the right side of the road progressively depart, driving away from the viewer and moving towards the right of the initial frame's view. A black car is first to leave, revealing a white hatchback behind it, which then also drives away. Finally, a grey SUV that was initially behind the hatchback departs, leaving the right-side parking area completely empty from the first-frame viewpoint.
