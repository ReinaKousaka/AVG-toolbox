A row of colorful, snow-dusted buildings stands across a wide river, with a covered blue boat, two yellow buoys, and a white swan visible in the water. A wooden structure, part of a bridge, occupies the immediate foreground to the top right.
end of description
As frames progress, the swan slowly moves to the right within the river. Simultaneously, a small group of people walk along the snowy embankment to the right, beyond the river. The viewpoint subtly pans right, revealing slightly more of the rightmost buildings and the interior details of the wooden bridge on the right.
