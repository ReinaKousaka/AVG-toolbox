The first frame shows a wet, dark asphalt road illuminated by streetlights during heavy rain, extending forward from the viewer. To the viewer's left, a concrete barrier topped with a white decorative metal railing runs along the road, behind which a red emergency box stands near a street light pole. Yellow road markings on the asphalt indicate an intersection ahead, with a circular manhole cover positioned centrally in the road. On the right, a building with horizontal wooden siding is visible, with green potted plants at its base.
