In the first frame, a man in a white t-shirt and mask holds a phone in the lower-left foreground of a city street at twilight. To the left midground, a modern glass building with an escalator is visible, and two green electric scooters are parked near a red double-decker bus further back. The right midground features commercial buildings with vibrant Korean signs, including "CLUB CLIO," while pedestrians, notably a woman with a red bag walking towards the right, populate the central midground. Distant buildings and a pale twilight sky complete the background.

Across subsequent frames, the foreground man moves from left to right, gradually exiting the frame from the right side. The woman with the red bag continues walking further away to the right, and other pedestrians in the midground also subtly shift their positions and move about. No new objects or scenes are revealed from the first-frame viewpoint; the primary dynamic is the continuous movement of people within the established street view.

In the first frame, a vibrant city street scene unfolds at dusk. In the immediate foreground, a person in a light pink top and black pants walks left-to-right, while two green electric scooters are parked slightly to their right. In the center-foreground, a person in a white shirt and black pants with a black bag walks towards the viewer, while two other individuals walk away from the viewer. To the right, a woman with a red bag walks away, past the bright "CLUB CLIO" store entrance which occupies the right side of the frame. The midground is bustling with numerous pedestrians, flanked by a modern glass building on the left and a red double-decker bus behind it, and multiple multi-story buildings adorned with colorful neon signs and advertisements on the right, all under a pale evening sky.

As the frames progress, the person in the white shirt and black pants moves significantly closer to the viewer, passing the green scooters. The woman with the red bag continues walking further away from the viewer towards the right. The couple previously in the mid-center also proceeds further into the distance, away from the viewer. Pedestrians across the midground and background exhibit continuous, subtle movement.
