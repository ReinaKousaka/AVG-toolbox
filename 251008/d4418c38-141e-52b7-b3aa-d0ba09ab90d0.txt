The first frame captures a bright outdoor scene featuring a wide pedestrian path on the left foreground, separated from a vibrant turquoise river by a dark metal railing and a strip of green grass on the right. Across the river in the midground stands a large, ornate building with a distinctive dark roof, balconies, and a flag, backed by majestic green mountains under a clear blue sky. A woman walks away from the viewer on the path's left, with a man in blue following further behind her.

The woman on the path quickly moves left and out of the frame. The man in blue continues walking away from the viewer on the left side of the path, gradually getting closer to the camera. He then puts on a red baseball cap and briefly glances back towards the viewer. Subsequently, he turns his body to face the viewer's left, revealing a backpack, as he continues walking towards the viewer on the path.
