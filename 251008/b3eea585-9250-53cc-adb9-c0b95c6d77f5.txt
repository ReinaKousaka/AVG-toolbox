The first frame displays a wet, brick-patterned sidewalk at night, with a large tree trunk prominently on the immediate left and a reflective, wet road beyond it showing green light reflections. Shop windows line the right, and a person with a yellow umbrella walks away from the viewer along the right sidewalk, while another figure stands further down the left.

In the following frames, the individual with the yellow umbrella continues moving further away from the first-frame viewpoint along the right sidewalk. The person standing on the left sidewalk subtly shifts posture but remains in their initial general position relative to the viewer.

A rain-slicked city street at night features a large tree and a street lamp on the immediate left, contrasting with a storefront facade on the immediate right. The wet cobblestone sidewalk, stretching into the midground, reflects ambient lights, as a person with a yellow umbrella walks away from the viewer on the right, and another with a black umbrella stands further down on the left, beside the street.

Over the frames, the yellow-umbrella-holder steadily moves further away from the viewer along the right sidewalk. The person with the black umbrella remains largely stationary on the left, while reflections on the continuously wet ground subtly shift due to the ongoing rainfall and distant traffic.

The first frame shows a rainy city street at night. To the far left, a black lamppost stands with a circular red sign and a rectangular white sign displaying Korean text. On the wet brick sidewalk, a person with a black umbrella stands near the curb on the left, while another person with a yellow umbrella walks away from the viewer along the right side. A line of trees runs parallel to the sidewalk, and on the right, buildings with illuminated signs, including one advertising "Barbecue Wine Beer Coffee" in English and Korean, stretch into the distance. The wet asphalt road to the left reflects distant vehicle headlights and city lights.

As frames progress, the person with the yellow umbrella continues walking further away on the right sidewalk, while the person under the black umbrella remains largely stationary on the left. A traffic light further down the street, beyond the black umbrella on the left, illuminates bright red, casting a vivid reflection onto the wet road. Vehicles with glowing headlights also continue to move along the wet road in the distance. Additionally, a small yellow sign labeled "133-2" becomes visible on the rightmost building wall, further down the street than the main storefronts.
