In the first frame, a night scene unfolds on a wide, brightly lit paved area. To the left, a dark, polygonal structure enclosed by metal barriers stands, with two masked people walking towards the viewer beside it. A dark blue police car with flashing blue lights is parked on the right, and a person stands near its front, facing away. In the mid-background, a large, ornate white building with a clock tower and festive lights is prominent, while a very tall, brightly lit Christmas tree dominates the far right.
end of description
The two masked individuals initially on the far left continue walking past the dark polygonal structure and move out of frame to the viewer's left. The person near the police car walks away from it, heading slightly right and then deeper into the background relative to the viewer, eventually walking almost parallel to the car. A small, dark-colored car emerges behind the police car and the walking person, moving from left to right across the mid-background. The police car and main background elements remain stationary.
