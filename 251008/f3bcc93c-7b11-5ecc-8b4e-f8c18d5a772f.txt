The first frame displays a bustling city sidewalk with a building on the viewer's left, featuring signs like "TASTY QUICK VALUE" and a group of people near its entrance. To the viewer's right, a woman sits by a large tree trunk, and a man crouches on a railing, as numerous pedestrians move along the central pavement, some approaching the viewer and others receding into the distant urban background.

In subsequent frames, the woman in the grey top and the man in the red t-shirt, initially in the mid-ground approaching the viewer's first-frame position, walk forward past the viewer towards the foreground left. Other pedestrians further back continue to move, some new individuals appearing to approach from the background towards the first-frame viewpoint, while others recede further into the distance. The group near the building entrance on the left and the man on the railing to the right remain largely stationary relative to their initial positions.
