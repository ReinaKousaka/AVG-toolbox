The first frame shows a mountain road on a sunny day, featuring a grey car parked on the left next to a stone wall with a 'TAXI' sign, while a bus stop stands on the right, all against a backdrop of towering mountains and a clear blue sky.

As the viewpoint progresses, the bus stop recedes to the right, revealing a brown directional sign and a distant valley view. The parked car and taxi sign on the left exit the frame as the road's central island, now adorned with green and white bollards, becomes more central. Simultaneously, a few people and a black scooter emerge on the left side near the bollards, while the winding road ahead stretches further into view.
