The first frame depicts a dusk street view from a moving vehicle, with a white car directly ahead and a bicyclist with a white umbrella to the right, alongside orange cones. Buildings with illuminated signs and pedestrians line the left sidewalk, while trees flank both sides of the road, leading to a cityscape under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the white car directly ahead, the bicyclist with the umbrella to the right, and a white utility cart on the far left all move forward, away from the viewer. White arrows indicating turns become visible on the road surface ahead, further confirming the viewer's continuous forward motion through the street.

In the first frame, the viewer faces a multi-lane road marked with white left-turn and straight arrows, and an orange traffic cone is visible on the right foreground. To the viewer's immediate left, a white utility vehicle and a green taxi are present, with a white sedan ahead in the main lane. Beyond these, storefronts with numerous pedestrians line the left sidewalk, mirrored by more buildings and pedestrians on the right sidewalk, where a street lamp also stands. Tall buildings rise on both sides of the street, leading to more distant structures, including a distinctive U-shaped building, under a cloudy sky, while a navigation interface occupies the top-left corner.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the road, causing the white sedan in front to also advance further into the scene. Pedestrians on both sidewalks and crossing the street continuously move, appearing from the sides and passing in front of the viewer. Concurrently, the orange traffic cone in the foreground shifts to the right and eventually out of the frame, as the street lamp and buildings on the right become closer and progressively move towards the right relative to the initial viewpoint. The navigation overlay in the top-left corner constantly updates, reflecting the forward progression.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a multi-lane city street at dusk, viewed from behind a white sedan and a green car stopped on a crosswalk marked with a forward arrow. Tall, multi-story buildings line both sides of the street, with pedestrians visible on the sidewalks and traversing the crosswalk, while a navigation overlay occupies the top-left corner.

end of description
Over the subsequent frames, the white sedan in the immediate foreground gradually moves forward, as does the green car positioned behind it, shifting slightly left. Pedestrians on the crosswalk continue their progression from the right side towards the left, with one person pushing a stroller becoming more centrally located relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The motorcycle on the far left of the initial frame also advances forward, becoming more fully visible as it moves past the white car.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a multi-lane city street ahead, bordered by multi-story buildings on both sides, with a navigation overlay occupying the top left. Directly in front of the viewer, white arrow road markings are visible, and the rear of a white car is at the bottom left. A green taxi is positioned ahead in the left lane, while pedestrians cross the street from right to left and walk along the sidewalks, where a motorbike and a small truck are also present further ahead.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the white car in the foreground slightly recedes as the green taxi and the motorbike on the left move forward away from the viewer. Pedestrians continue their movement across the crosswalk from right to left and along the sidewalk to the right, concurrently with the small truck also advancing forward, and the navigation overlay updating in the top left.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a street looking forward, with a silver-green taxi centrally positioned in front of the viewer. Tall buildings line both sides of the street, with a bicycle and cart to the left of the taxi, and a grey pickup truck laden with produce and a small white dog to its right. end of description. The camera slowly moves forward through the street, causing pedestrians previously in the midground to move further away from the viewer. A new individual in a red shirt appears to the far right, also moving forward away from the first-frame viewpoint, while the bicycle with the cart on the left progresses slightly.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A silver-green taxi is in the foreground, centered at the bottom, with its license plate WA 076056 visible. Flanking the taxi are parts of a dark pushcart on the left and a merchandise stall on the right. A city street extends into the distance, lined by multi-story buildings with illuminated storefronts like "GAGA" on the left and various shops on the right, interspersed with trees. Pedestrians walk on sidewalks and cross the street in the midground, under a partly cloudy sky, with an AR navigation overlay in the top-left corner.
end of description
Pedestrians, initially in the mid-right, progressively move further away from the viewer, while a cyclist crosses the street from the mid-left towards the mid-right, advancing into the background. Subsequently, multiple scooters/motorcycles emerge from the mid-left and proceed towards the background, passing the stationary taxi. Simultaneously, more people and a small white scooter become visible moving away on the right side of the street. Concurrently, the augmented reality navigation overlay in the top-left updates, indicating the viewer's virtual progression along the depicted route.
