The first frame displays a lavish living room with a blue sofa on the far left, a white coffee table with a green plant arrangement centrally, and a patterned armchair behind it. To the right, a dark chest of drawers below a wall-mounted TV, and a bookshelf in the back center, are all framed by ornate curtains and a prominent ceiling chandelier.

As the view subtly pans right, the blue sofa recedes from the far left, while the coffee table and armchair shift slightly leftwards, enhancing the visibility of the chest of drawers, TV, and an upholstered stool on the right.
