The first frame displays a narrow river or creek flowing from the mid-ground into the distant background, bordered by dense green foliage and trees on both sides. A prominent tree trunk stands on the left bank in the foreground, while a grassy path winds along the right bank into the distance, featuring a large bush and a yellow-flowered tree on the right.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly advances forward, revealing more of the river as it curves further into the distant left, with the surrounding trees and foliage receding into the background relative to their first-frame positions. The grassy path on the right bank continues to unfold, and subtle ripples become more evident on the water's surface as the scene gently progresses.
