The first frame reveals a narrow street at dusk, lined with multi-story buildings. A dark grey hatchback car is positioned in the foreground on the right, partially visible from its rear-right, while a black and white bollard stands on the pavement near the bottom center-left. Further down the street, a red car with illuminated taillights is centrally located, with buildings continuing into the background and a rocky cliff visible in the far distance on the left.

Through subsequent frames, the dark grey hatchback on the right moves steadily away from the first-frame viewpoint, increasingly revealing its full rear as it proceeds down the street. Simultaneously, the red car in the midground also continues to move further into the distance, appearing smaller as it recedes from the initial viewpoint.

The first frame shows a narrow street at dusk, receding into the distance, flanked by buildings. To the immediate left, a light-colored building is partially visible, while to the right, a darker wooden building with illuminated shop windows and flags hangs, with an e-scooter parked beneath. Further along the right side, lighter-colored buildings with distinct shutters and streetlamps appear. A dark gray car is positioned mid-street, moving away from the viewer, followed by a red car and a cyclist further ahead of it, all receding towards a rocky mountain face in the distant background.
end of description
From the initial viewpoint, the dark gray car on the street continues moving further away from the viewer. The red car, initially ahead of the dark gray car, also recedes further into the distance down the street. The cyclist, positioned to the left of the cars, steadily progresses further down the street away from the viewer, eventually passing both vehicles. No new objects or scenes are revealed; only the existing vehicles demonstrate forward movement within the established streetscape.
