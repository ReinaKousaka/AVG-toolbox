The first frame depicts a narrow street lined with traditional Japanese buildings under a cloudy sky, extending into the distance. On the left, a person walks away from the viewer past orange traffic cones on the sidewalk, alongside buildings featuring signs. To the right, a brown building entrance is visible, with a green and white striped cone and a yellow and black barrier positioned in the immediate foreground, next to a black pole.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera subtly moves forward along the street. The person on the left continues walking further into the midground, while the orange cones on the left and the green cone and barrier on the immediate right recede further from the viewer, subtly shifting towards the edges of the expanding visible scene.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a narrow, cobblestone street extending into the distance, bordered by traditional Japanese buildings with tiled roofs under an overcast sky. On the left, buildings feature closed corrugated shutters and three orange traffic cones near the curb, while a large white lantern hangs from a building on the right, alongside a black pole in the immediate foreground. A man in a dark jacket and blue jeans walks down the street, away from the viewer and slightly left of center.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the man continues walking further down the street, steadily moving away from the viewer towards the background, while all other objects, including the orange cones and buildings, remain stationary.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
A man with a green backpack and a phone walks towards the right on a stone-paved street. To his immediate left are two orange cones connected by black and yellow striped barrier tape, set against a closed building facade. On the right, traditional Japanese buildings line the street, with a prominent structure featuring a dark tiled roof, wooden architecture, and two large white lanterns hanging from its eaves. The street recedes into the distance, flanked by similar traditional buildings under a light sky.
end of description
The man continues walking towards the right side of the frame, progressively moving out of view. As he exits, more of the orange cones and barrier tape to the left of his initial position become clearly visible.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A paved street extends forward into the distance, flanked by traditional Japanese buildings. To the viewer's immediate left, a red cone is present, with two white utility meters visible on a building further along the street. On the right, a tall stone pillar and a white paper lantern hanging from an eave are prominent near the viewer, with a green pine tree branch extending from above.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances forward, the red cone, utility meters, stone pillar, and lantern gradually move out of frame to the left and right. This progression continuously reveals new sections of the receding street and additional building facades further ahead of the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a narrow, paved street extending into the distance under a pale sky. To the viewer's left, a row of traditional Japanese buildings with various facades lines the street, with a light-colored meter on a stand in the foreground and a yellow bucket further down. To the viewer's right, a concrete wall and fence section off a traditional wooden structure with a calligraphic sign, overshadowed by a gnarled pine tree.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly moves forward down the street, causing the meter-like structure and yellow bucket on the left to recede out of view. As the camera progresses, a circular manhole cover becomes visible on the street surface to the left. The buildings on both sides become closer, revealing more architectural details, such as a red/orange banner appearing on a left-side building. The concrete wall on the right also recedes, offering a clearer view of the wooden structure behind it.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a paved street, looking forward down its length under an overcast sky. In the foreground, a metal manhole cover is visible on the street slightly to the left. To the left, a row of traditional Japanese-style buildings, featuring various facades and some with closed shutters, stretches into the distance, with an orange object and a white chair visible near one storefront. To the right, a stone wall topped with green foliage and a tree branch runs alongside the street, featuring steps leading up from the pavement, followed by other buildings further down the street, some covered with tarps. The street narrows and recedes into the background, flanked by more buildings on both sides, under a light grey sky.
end of description
Across the subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly progresses forward along the paved street. This causes objects previously in the midground, such as the buildings lining both sides and the stone wall to the right, to appear slightly closer to the viewer. The manhole cover in the foreground gradually moves upward in the frame, confirming this subtle forward movement. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the overall street vista remains consistently visible.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The viewer looks down a narrow, paved street lined with traditional Japanese-style buildings under an overcast sky. On the left, an orange structure and a white chair holding a plant are visible near the foreground. On the right, a gray wall with foliage and buildings under scaffolding line the path.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the white chair, plant, and orange structure on the left side near the first-frame viewpoint progressively vanish from the scene.
