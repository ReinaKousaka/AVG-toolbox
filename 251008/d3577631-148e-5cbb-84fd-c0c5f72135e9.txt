The first frame depicts a paved, winding road curving uphill towards the right, bordered on the left by a dense green hedge and a grey curb, and on the right by several dark wooden fence posts separating it from an expansive, bright green grassy hillside. Scattered trees dot the hills and line the top of the hedge on the left, all beneath a clear blue sky with some white clouds and a bright sun in the upper left.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the dense hedge on the left recedes, gradually revealing a concrete structure with a dark garage door positioned directly to the left of the road. This structure becomes fully visible, while the grassy hillside on the right, punctuated by trees, continues to be present as the winding road progresses uphill.
