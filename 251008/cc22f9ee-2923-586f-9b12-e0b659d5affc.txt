On the left, a white building with orange 'au' signs and a vending machine lines a narrow asphalt alley marked with "止まれ". A utility pole stands centrally, with a white construction barrier on the right, while a main road with a pedestrian crossing, a multi-story building, and a white van are visible in the background.

Initially, a black sedan appears, moving from left to right across the main road in the mid-ground. Following this, a white and blue flatbed truck enters the scene from the left on the main road, traversing towards the right. Finally, a small silver car also emerges from the left and moves right behind the truck on the same road.

The first frame displays a narrow street leading to a main road, with a white building featuring prominent orange 'au' signs on the left and white construction barriers on the right. On the main road ahead, a green flatbed truck moves leftward, partially obscuring a silver car moving rightward, all beneath an overcast sky with a multi-windowed building in the background.
end of description
The green truck continues left and exits the scene, as the silver car proceeds right across the main road from the first-frame viewpoint. Subsequently, a person on a pink bicycle emerges from the left and cycles across the main road, followed by a white van and another white car moving rightward in the distance.

In the first frame, a white building with a large orange "au" sign on its facade is prominent on the left. A street with a white crosswalk extends diagonally from the lower left to the center, where a white car is driving from right to left. To the car's right, a pink bicycle is parked, and a utility pole with a red stop sign and blue directional sign stands at the corner of the building. Across the street in the midground, a multi-story building with many rectangular, green-tinted windows is visible, with construction barriers on the right foreground.
end of description
The white car on the street proceeds from right to left, passing the utility pole and exiting the frame to the left. Subsequently, a person on a brown bicycle with a front basket appears from the right, riding across the midground crosswalk from right to left. This cyclist moves past the utility pole on the left, continuing their trajectory. Shortly after, a second person on a darker bicycle enters the frame from the far right, also traveling from right to left across the street, behind the initial construction barriers. The parked pink bicycle remains stationary to the right of the utility pole throughout the sequence.

In the first frame, an 'au' branded building occupies the left foreground, adjacent to a pole with road signs marking a crosswalk where two masked individuals on bicycles are crossing from right to left. Across the road, a blue-green multi-story building and a white construction barrier on the far right are visible.
end of description
A black car subsequently appears from the right, driving left on the road behind the cyclists. The initial two cyclists continue moving left, exiting the frame, followed by the black car. Finally, a third cyclist on a black bicycle enters the crosswalk from the right foreground, beginning their traversal.

On the left, a part of a building with an orange sign is visible, next to a utility pole adorned with several Japanese road signs. A street with a pedestrian crossing occupies the midground, leading to a large building with a green-grid windowed facade and ground-level storefronts. A person on a bicycle, carrying a dark object on its rear, is positioned on the pedestrian crossing in the midground, moving left from the right side of the viewer.
end of description
A white station wagon drives onto the street from the right, passing behind the first cyclist, and then exits to the left. The first cyclist continues left as a second cyclist, wearing white, appears from the right, also crossing left on the pedestrian crossing. Subsequently, a white minivan and a silver car consecutively enter the street from the right, proceeding left behind the cyclists. All traffic moves horizontally from right to left across the viewer's field of vision.
