The initial frame shows a wet street receding into the distance, bordered by colorful multi-story buildings on both sides; a brown wooden building with shops is on the viewer's right, followed by lighter buildings with red and green shutters. Further down the street on the left, a dark car is parked, with a green mountain rising in the far background. A person holding a blue umbrella walks away from the viewer on the right side of the street, positioned between the red-shuttered building and the parked car.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the individual with the blue umbrella steadily walks further into the distance along the street, remaining on the right side relative to the first-frame viewpoint, without new objects or scenes appearing.
