A wide wooden boardwalk stretches from the foreground to the mid-ground, lined on its left by multiple rows of light-colored benches, facing a dry, grassy field. In the mid-ground, two people walk away from the viewer on the right side of the boardwalk, leading towards a large building complex and dense evergreen trees against a hazy sky in the background.

In the following frames, the two individuals on the boardwalk continue moving further away from the viewer and slightly to the right, with the woman in the lighter jacket pulling slightly ahead of the man. Other distant figures also appear to progress further along the boardwalk. No new objects or scenes are revealed, only the continuous motion of existing elements.

The initial frame displays a wide wooden boardwalk curving towards the middle-right. Along its left edge, a series of light-colored benches faces a yellowish grassy field, with a large dark building complex and evergreen trees situated in the mid-ground. Distant hazy mountains are visible behind the building, and several people are scattered across the mid-ground of the scene.

Across the subsequent frames, the camera subtly zooms out and tilts slightly downward. People on the boardwalk in the mid-ground exhibit movement; a group on the right progresses further away, while a person initially seated on a bench on the left stands up and moves towards the right side of the scene.
