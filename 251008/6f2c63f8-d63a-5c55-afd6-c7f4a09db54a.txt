The first frame displays the viewer positioned on a body of water, facing forward, with the massive, dark, metallic underside of a bridge spanning horizontally across the upper half of the view. Below this bridge, a river stretches into the distance, reflecting sunlight from the far background where numerous city buildings and another, smaller bridge are visible. To the left, a green shoreline with buildings and trees appears, contrasted by a concrete wall lining the water on the right.

As the video progresses, the camera smoothly moves forward underneath the initial bridge. Subtle ripples continuously shift across the water's surface, and tiny splashes sporadically appear on the left foreground, drifting towards the right mid-ground. In the far distance, a small, dark boat slowly traverses from right to left beneath the second bridge.
