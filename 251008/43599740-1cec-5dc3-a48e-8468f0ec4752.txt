The first frame depicts a gray asphalt road curving gently to the right in the mid-distance, extending directly from the viewer. To the immediate left, a red and white striped barrier is partially visible, with a metal guardrail extending along the road, backed by bare deciduous trees. On the right, a moss-covered stone retaining wall parallels the road, above which a snow-covered hillside with evergreen and bare trees ascends under an overcast sky.

As the frames advance, the perspective moves forward along the road. The red and white barrier initially on the viewer's immediate left quickly recedes out of frame. The guardrail on the left and the stone wall on the right progressively reveal more length as the viewer proceeds, while the snow-dusted forest on the hillside and the bare trees on the left continuously shift, revealing new sections of the roadside landscape ahead.
