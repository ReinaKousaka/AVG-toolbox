A dirt path extends forward from the viewer, flanked by steep, green hillsides adorned with rocks and purple flowers on the left, and descending to a vast ocean under a cloudy sky on the right. Data overlays showing progress and run metrics are visible on the left and bottom right corners, respectively. end of description. The scene progresses forward as the viewer moves along the path, causing a wet patch, initially ahead, to approach and then pass beneath. The foreground vegetation shifts as the path is traversed, while the distant ocean and sky remain to the right. Concurrently, the run metrics update chronologically in the bottom right.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
In the first frame, a dirt path extends from the bottom center into the middle distance, curving slightly to the left. To the immediate left and right of the path, lush green vegetation with scattered purple flowers and rocks is visible. A steep, verdant hillside covered in shrubs and patches of purple ascends along the left side of the path, reaching towards the upper left. To the right, a similar grassy slope descends towards the expansive blue ocean, which fills the right half of the background under a cloudy sky with hints of blue in the upper left. A vertical green bar graph on the bottom left shows a scale from 0.0 to 11.0, with a gray marker at 7.6 km, while the bottom right displays running metrics: 06:16/km, 18 km/h, 10:05/mi, 00:59:45, and "Swiss Running TV".

end of description

As the viewpoint progresses, new segments of the dirt path, along with the vibrant green and purple-flowered vegetation that were previously *beyond* the scope of the first frame's distant view, are continuously revealed *ahead* of the viewer. The immediate foreground path and foliage from the first frame move *under* and *past* the viewer's initial position, appearing to recede *behind* it. The distant ocean to the right and the hillside to the left maintain their general spatial relationship to the viewer as the foreground changes. Concurrently, the on-screen running metrics on the bottom right corner (time, speed, distance) update incrementally, and the progress bar on the bottom left subtly reflects ongoing movement despite the "7.6 km" marker remaining static.
