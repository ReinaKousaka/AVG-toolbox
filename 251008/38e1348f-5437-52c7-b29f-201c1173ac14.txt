In the first frame, a city street at dusk is shown. Immediately to the left of the viewer, a partially visible sandwich board sign advertises "HAPPY HOUR," and a woman in a dark jacket walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk. Further along the left sidewalk, under a glass awning, are storefronts, an illuminated orange circular 'BB' sign, and a red neon 'TM' sign. Numerous pedestrians are visible walking further down the sidewalk away from the viewer. To the viewer's right, a street with several trees displaying autumnal foliage, streetlights, and a white food truck-like vehicle extends into the distance. Tall buildings with illuminated windows line both sides of the street, under a dark blue sky.

The viewer progresses forward along the street. The initial foreground woman moves further into the midground, and the sandwich board sign on the far left moves out of frame to the viewer's left, revealing a building number '560' on a pillar. The orange circular sign and red 'TM' neon sign on the left storefronts appear to move further away and slightly upward relative to their initial first-frame positions. Other pedestrians continue to move along the sidewalks, shifting their positions within the visible crowd as the viewpoint advances.

The first frame shows a bustling city street scene at dusk. To the viewer's immediate left, a sidewalk with several pedestrians, including a man in a dark jacket closest to the viewer, runs alongside a building displaying the number '580' and an awning overhead. Further down the sidewalk on the left, a red rectangular sign is visible. To the right, trees with sparse autumn leaves, streetlights, and a white food cart line the curb, beyond which a street with distant vehicles and tall buildings stretches into the background under a cloudy evening sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly to the right. The man closest on the left moves further into the foreground and then partially exits the frame as the camera advances. More pedestrians continuously move along the sidewalk. A street sign, "E Davie St," on a light pole to the right becomes more clearly visible, indicating a slow forward motion of the viewpoint that brings new elements into focus while others recede.

The first frame displays a bustling city street at dusk, featuring a covered sidewalk on the left with pedestrians walking both towards and away from the viewer, alongside a building exhibiting a "Shoppers Drug Mart" sign. To the viewer's right, a parallel sidewalk adorned with autumn trees hosts a white food cart marked with a red 'M', leading towards a street bustling with distant traffic and flanked by tall buildings under a dim sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, additional pedestrians continuously appear from further ahead on the sidewalk, moving past the initial viewpoint to the left. Objects like the "Shoppers Drug Mart" sign, initially to the viewer's left, gradually shift past and behind the original viewpoint, while the food cart on the right also appears to draw closer before receding behind the viewer's advancing path.

To the viewer's right, a white food vendor cart and a tree with autumn leaves stand on the sidewalk, with a street and tall buildings in the distant background.
end of description
As the frames progress, pedestrians continue to move past the initial viewpoint along the sidewalk towards the right. A notable dynamic change is the traffic light in the distant background, positioned to the right of the vendor cart, which transitions from green to red.

First, a city sidewalk fills the left foreground and midground, bustling with pedestrians walking away from the viewer, beneath an awning, a "Shoppers Drug Mart" sign, and a red "THE" neon sign further down the street. On the right, a white food cart with a red gas tank is parked on the sidewalk next to a tree with autumn leaves, with a red traffic light and a "Dunsmuir St" sign visible at the intersection beyond it, all against a backdrop of tall buildings under a twilight sky. end of description. The traffic light, visible to the right of the food cart, changes from red to green by the fifth frame. Concurrently, pedestrians continuously move from the left foreground, passing the viewer and proceeding along the sidewalk past the food cart into the midground and background.

In the first frame, a person in a dark cap and glasses is partially visible on the far left of the foreground, facing right. To the right of the viewer, a white food truck with a large 'M' logo, "Mister Chai", and "Kabob House" text is stationary on the sidewalk, with two propane tanks at its base. Beyond the food truck, a street sign reads "smuir St". In the midground, several pedestrians walk away from the viewer on the sidewalk, which is bordered by a building with an overhang and a red neon sign on the left. Tall buildings and streetlights line the street in the background, under a twilight sky.
end of description
From the first-frame viewpoint, the person initially on the far left of the foreground moves out of view to the left. Concurrently, a new person wearing a purple puffy jacket emerges into the frame from the far left of the foreground, also moving left. The street sign to the right, initially partially visible, fully reveals itself as "Dunsmuir St." Other pedestrians on the sidewalk continue to walk further away from the viewer.
