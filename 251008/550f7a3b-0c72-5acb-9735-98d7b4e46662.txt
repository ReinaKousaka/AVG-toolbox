The first frame captures a backyard scene with a glass pool fence in the left foreground, bordering a dark covered pool in the mid-ground. To the right of the pool are pavers and a wooden fence along the right background, while a large, bright green deciduous tree and a row of evergreen trees are visible in the center-left background.

The camera slowly pans right, progressively revealing more of the dark decking on the far left and a previously obscured structure (a shed or pool house) situated to the left of the pool. As the panning continues, a round, built-in seating area beyond the pool cover on the left side of the yard becomes fully visible, expanding the view of the outdoor living space relative to the initial frame.
