The first frame depicts a wet city intersection on an overcast day. A multi-story building with a red 'MAXWAY' awning lines the left sidewalk, where several pedestrians walk towards or away from the viewer. Across the street, a yellow car drives left through the intersection, trailed by a black car, with a traffic light pole displaying rainbow flags in the midground.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the pedestrians on the left continue moving, some exiting to the left. The yellow and black cars proceed further left across the intersection, away from the viewer. A light-colored SUV emerges from the far right, slowly advancing into the foreground of the intersection.

The first frame captures a wet city street corner with three pedestrians in the foreground: a person in a black hooded jacket on the far left, a person in a red hooded jacket and blue shorts with a white mask to their right, and a person with a light backpack walking away in the center. To the left, a building with a red "SMARTWAY" awning stands next to a traffic light, while a yellow taxi turns right in the midground street, with other cars and distant buildings visible beyond.
end of description
Subsequently, the three foreground pedestrians continue moving towards the right and away from the viewer, gradually exiting the frame to the right. Simultaneously, the yellow taxi finishes its right turn and disappears from view to the right, while cars further down the street advance slightly.

The first frame captures a rainy street scene on an overcast day. To the left, a sidewalk runs alongside a building with a red and orange striped awning, displaying "PARTWAY" and "ATM." A group of pedestrians, including one holding a black umbrella, walks on the sidewalk in the mid-left, while another person with a light-colored backpack walks away from the viewer towards the street corner in the mid-center-left. A traffic light pole with a green light and a rainbow-colored banner stands at this corner. The wet street, visible to the right and center, features white markings and multiple cars, including a dark red car with headlights on, driving away from the viewer in the mid-right. In the background, more buildings and overhead wires are visible under a gray sky.

end of description

The group of pedestrians on the left sidewalk moves closer to the viewer, passing from the mid-left to the foreground-left. Concurrently, the person with the backpack continues walking further down the street, remaining in the mid-center. A new man in a dark coat, holding a skateboard, emerges from behind the initial pedestrian group on the mid-left and walks towards the foreground-left, eventually passing the viewer. On the wet street to the right, the dark red car proceeds further away, while a silver car appears from further down the street on the mid-right and moves past the viewer on the right side.

The first frame shows a wet city sidewalk on the left foreground with two people approaching: one in a black raincoat and another partially obscured, while a person with a light backpack walks away in the midground. To the left, a building with a red awning and ATM sign lines the sidewalk, opposite a wet street on the right where a black car turns, with other vehicles in the background and a traffic light pole centrally positioned.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, the two individuals originally approaching the viewer move left, gradually revealing the second person in a camo hoodie holding an umbrella, before both exit the frame. Meanwhile, the person with the light backpack continues walking away from the viewer along the sidewalk, joined by a newly revealed person in a red jacket appearing behind them. The black car on the street consistently moves right relative to the first-frame viewpoint, eventually leaving the scene.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a wet city sidewalk on an overcast day, with storefronts on the left and a street on the right. A man with a backpack walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk, while a red sedan and other vehicles move away on the street, past a traffic light pole with a green light and a "THURLOW" street sign.
end of description
As the scene progresses, both the man with the backpack and another person in a red jacket continue walking further away from the viewer along the sidewalk. Simultaneously, the red car on the street also drives further away to the right. A new individual, dressed in a black jacket and light pants, then appears from the far left foreground, walking towards the right and passing close in front of the viewer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, the viewer stands on a sidewalk adjacent to storefronts on the left, featuring red and blue awnings. A person in a black jacket and beanie walks away from the viewer in the foreground, partially obscuring a "6/49 Gold Ball 58 MILLION" sign on the ground. Further down the sidewalk, another person with a backpack and a person in a red jacket also walk away. To the right, a street pole displays a "THURLOW" sign and an active pedestrian signal, with a black trash can and a blue "Jackpot loto.ca" vending machine next to it. Beyond the pole, a street hosts a red car moving right and a black SUV further back, with distant buildings and trees under an overcast sky.
end of description
The person in the black jacket moves forward and slightly right, revealing an "OPEN" sign in the store window to the left and a purple water bottle in their right hand, while the "6/49" sign moves out of view. The red car on the street continues to drive further to the right, away from the intersection. A new person in a blue puffer jacket enters the frame from the far left, walking towards the viewer, positioned closer than the initial black-jacketed person. All individuals continue their progression away from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents two individuals walking away on a sidewalk: one in a dark puffer jacket on the left foreground and another in a black jacket midground-right, holding a purple object. To their left is a building with a blue awning, while a garbage bin and newspaper box are in the right foreground, with a street and trees further ahead.
end of description
As subsequent frames progress, both individuals move further ahead, away from the first-frame viewpoint, with the person on the right now clearly holding a purple water bottle. The garbage bin and newspaper box on the right move out of view to the right. Concurrently, new storefront details and a red Canadian flag on the building to the left are revealed as the scene progresses forward relative to the initial viewpoint.
