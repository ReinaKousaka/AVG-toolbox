In the first frame, a nighttime city street is filled with people and vehicles. Closest to the viewer, at the bottom left, is the back of a person with blonde hair and a black backpack. To their left, a woman in a light blue top and another person in a white hat holding a phone are visible. In the mid-ground center, a person wearing a black t-shirt carries a large gold-framed portrait of a young boy. To the right of them, a person in a black mask and a person in a glowing skeleton costume are seen, with a brightly lit pedicab behind them, all moving forward. The background features tall city buildings with illuminated windows under a dark sky.

As frames progress, the face within the gold-framed portrait held by the person in the center dynamically changes from the young boy to a clown, then to a man in uniform, followed by an older man, and finally a man in a blue headwrap, all depicted in different styles. Concurrently, the person carrying the portrait, the skeleton-costumed individual, and the pedicab all move forward and slightly to the left relative to the initial viewpoint, revealing more of the street and people further down the block.
