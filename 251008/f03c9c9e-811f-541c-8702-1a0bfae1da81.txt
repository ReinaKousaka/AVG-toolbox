The initial frame shows a narrow village street bordered by a close-up wooden building with a green shutter on the far left, and a multi-storied ornate wooden house on the right, fronted by a white wall, a stone wall, and a green bush, all set against distant green mountains.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward down the street, revealing more windows and green shutters along the left building, which were initially ahead on the left. A bicycle emerges into view, attached to the left building further down the street from the initial position. As the camera advances, additional distant buildings and details of the mountain range, initially ahead, become more prominent, while the right-side house and bush recede into the background.
