The first frame displays a stone building with a red-tiled roof and a prominent tower, situated centrally on a green, shrub-covered hillside. To its lower left, a partially visible house with a red-tiled roof and timber framing appears closer to the viewer. A large tree with yellowish foliage stands on the hillside to the right of the main building, with distant mountains and a cloudy sky completing the background.
