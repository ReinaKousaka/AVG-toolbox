In subsequent frames, the black scooter and the white car continue moving forward along the road, passing the first-frame viewpoint. A pedestrian holding an umbrella then emerges from the left sidewalk and crosses the street towards the right side. Rain consistently falls, causing visible splashes and reflections as vehicles and the pedestrian proceed along the street.
