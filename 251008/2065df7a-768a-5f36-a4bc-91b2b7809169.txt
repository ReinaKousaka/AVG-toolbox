In the first frame, two women walk away from the viewer on a sunlit sidewalk. The woman closer to the viewer wears a light gray suit and carries a beige bag on her left shoulder, while the second woman wears a dark jacket and white pants. To the far left, a 'no entry' sign on a pole stands near a crosswalk, with a tall building and a parked scooter visible further back. To the right, a corner building houses a restaurant with outdoor seating featuring yellow wicker chairs and small round tables. In the mid-ground, a 'METRO' sign is visible to the left, partially obscured by trees, with traffic and a distant structure beyond.

As the camera moves forward, following the two women, the street and the Metro station entrance on the left, initially in the mid-ground, become more fully revealed to the viewer's left. The cafe's outdoor seating on the right recedes into the mid-ground, and the reflections on its glass facade become more distinct, revealing the interior and "Bernhardt" in gold lettering. Vehicles previously further down the street on the left appear closer as the viewpoint progresses.

The first frame depicts a pedestrian's perspective walking on a sunlit city sidewalk. A person in a light grey suit with a matching bag walks ahead, away from the viewer, positioned centrally on the sidewalk. To the right, a cafe with an outdoor seating area (tables and chairs under an awning) lines a building facade, extending into the distance, with interior lights visible. To the left, a street features parked white vans and cars further off, alongside a black metal railing and stairs descending below sidewalk level. Lush green trees and a distant tall building are visible beyond the street, with bright sunlight shining through the trees in the upper left.

The central figure continues walking forward as the viewer progresses. A man in a suit, initially appearing in the distant left background relative to the first-frame viewpoint, walks towards the viewer, eventually passing to the left of the central figure and then out of frame to the viewer's left. Later, another person emerges from the distant left background, also walking towards the viewer on the sidewalk.

The initial frame presents a sunlit city street from a walking perspective, featuring a person in a light blue jacket walking away centrally on the sidewalk, with a cafe storefront and a circular menu board to the right and a tree, trash can, and parked white vans visible on the left.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the initial menu board on the right recedes, revealing numerous outdoor cafe tables and chairs lining the sidewalk. The person in blue and others ahead continue walking away, moving further from the viewer, while the white van and trash can on the left are gradually passed. Further down the street, additional buildings with awnings and more parked vehicles on the left become visible, creating a continuous urban scene.
