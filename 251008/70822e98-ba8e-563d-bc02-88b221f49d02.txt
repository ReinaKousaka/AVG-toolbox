The first frame prominently displays the back of a blonde-haired person in a black jacket in the mid-right foreground, partially obscuring a young man in a grey PSG shirt walking towards the viewer on the left. To the right, a lamppost base and an outdoor cafe are visible, while a bustling Parisian street with trees and shops like "CAFE GEORGE V" extends into the distance.

As frames progress, the foreground blonde person moves forward and exits to the right of the initial viewpoint, and the young man in the PSG shirt moves past the initial viewpoint to its left. This forward movement reveals more of the street ahead, including a new man in a light suit with a dark bag appearing from the left and walking into the mid-ground. The scene continuously unfolds, showcasing a longer stretch of the pedestrian-filled street, trees, and buildings further along from the initial viewpoint.

The first frame captures a wide pedestrian boulevard in a city. In the foreground left, a man wearing light trousers, a grey jacket, and carrying a blue and white bag walks away from the viewer. Immediately to his left is a cafe with a red awning displaying "GEORGE V" and "AWAY," showing interior seating through its large windows. A long row of buildings with shops and vibrant advertisements extends into the distance along the left side. A paved walkway occupies the midground, populated by many pedestrians walking both away from and towards the viewer. A line of trees in circular planters runs along the right side of the walkway, and in the foreground right, the base of a black lamp post is visible. Further right, an outdoor seating area with people and more trees extends into the background under an overcast sky.

In the subsequent frames, the man in the foreground left continues walking further away from the first-frame viewpoint. Other pedestrians on the central walkway also move, some receding into the distance and others approaching. The people on the right side similarly shift their positions, progressing further along the path relative to the first-frame viewpoint. No new objects or scenes are revealed, only the movement of existing elements within the static setting.
