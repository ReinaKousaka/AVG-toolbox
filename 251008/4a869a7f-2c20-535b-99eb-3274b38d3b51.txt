The first frame presents a sunny city street scene featuring a dark scooter with a rider in the foreground, positioned left of center, moving towards the right. A wide multi-lane road stretches into the background, bordered on the left by parked cars behind a barrier and on the right by a paved area with purple flowers. Tall buildings line both sides of the street, and a blue bicycle sign is visible high on the right.

Subsequently, the scooter and rider steadily proceed across the foreground road towards the right. A new blue sign, showing a bus with arrows and Chinese text, appears and progressively lowers and clarifies to the right of the bicycle sign, slightly further from the viewer. The white car initially behind the scooter also moves forward, remaining to the left of the viewpoint.

The first frame presents a wide-angle view of a multi-lane city road under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, white road markings, including arrows, are visible on the asphalt, with a three-wheeled scooter ridden by a person and carrying a green cargo box positioned in the middle right lane, moving away from the viewer. To the immediate left, a white metal barrier separates the main road from a parking lane where several white cars are parked, backed by trees and buildings. Further into the midground, more trees and buildings line both sides of the street, with a dense cityscape featuring multiple high-rise buildings receding into the distance in the background. An augmented reality navigation overlay is visible in the upper left corner, and a blue overhead road sign is partially visible on the far right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The three-wheeled scooter, initially in the middle right, moves further away from the viewer, appearing smaller and shifting slightly towards the center of the right lane. Consequently, the road markings beneath the viewer also advance and recede, and the distant buildings, including a tall building with a blue construction crane on the far right, become more prominent as the scene unfolds.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a multi-lane city road stretching into the background under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's right, an electric scooter loaded with a green delivery box and brown packages travels away on the outermost lane. On the left, several parked cars, including white and light blue vehicles, are visible behind a protective metal barrier. Both sides of the road are flanked by trees and various buildings, with older architectural styles on the left and modern high-rises, including one under construction with a visible crane, on the right. An augmented reality graphic, featuring a green flag and a blue arrow, occupies the top-left corner of the frame.
end of description
The electric scooter on the right side of the road steadily recedes further into the distance from the viewer. Simultaneously, the augmented reality overlay in the top-left corner remains present, displaying subtle internal graphic shifts. On the left side of the road, a blue bus gradually becomes more visible in the midground, appearing from behind the initial parked white car and slowly moving towards the right within the frame, followed by a white van further back.

The first frame displays a wide, multi-lane road extending into the distance under a clear blue sky, flanked by white metal barriers. Beyond the barriers, on both sides, are green trees and various urban buildings, including a prominent skyscraper under construction in the mid-ground and a parked white van on the left. A semi-transparent navigation map overlay, featuring a blue arrow, a red line, and map details, occupies the top-left corner.

end of description

In following frames, the navigation overlay in the top-left corner dynamically updates, displaying Chinese text such as "王道坊", "荣华路", "车站", and a "9" speed limit sign with "268m", eventually showing "长沙市第二". Simultaneously, the viewpoint subtly progresses forward along the road, causing the road markings and objects like the white van on the left to gradually shift perspective.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a multi-lane road stretching into the distance from the viewer's central position, flanked by white guardrails. To the viewer's left, a row of green trees, buildings (one with a distinctive circular top), and several white parked cars are visible, along with a navigation overlay in the upper left. To the viewer's right, a similar row of trees, red flowers, streetlights, and buildings appear, with a dark car parked nearer the viewer. In the distant background, under a clear blue sky, numerous skyscrapers including one under construction are prominent.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The white and yellow lane markings on the asphalt move closer to the viewer and then pass behind. The parked white cars on the left and the dark car on the right move past the viewer, revealing more of the continuous urban landscape and rows of trees on both sides. New white arrow markings appear on the road ahead, and the distance shown in the upper left navigation overlay steadily decreases (e.g., from 260M to 230M), indicating the viewer is approaching a destination.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a wide, multi-lane city road extending into the distance under a clear blue sky, bordered by white metal barriers, green trees, and numerous city buildings on both sides, with an augmented reality overlay in the upper left corner indicating a parking location 220 meters ahead.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road; the augmented reality overlay's distance marker steadily decreases from 220m to 100m, shifting downward and left relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the road markings and distant vehicles appear to recede, confirming a continuous forward motion of the camera through the scene.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a multi-lane city road looking forward into a dense cityscape under a clear blue sky. White barriers line both sides of the road, which has white dashed lane markers and a yellow line on the right; several cars are visible further down the road. On the left, beyond the barrier, are trees, a white bus stop structure, and numerous buildings, with navigation overlays in the upper left showing a green line at '60M' and a blue arrow at '110M'. On the right, beyond the barrier, are trees, red bushes, a white SUV, and more buildings, with a tall skyscraper under construction prominently in the far background.

end of description

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the lane markings to pass beneath the viewer and the city objects to advance into the frame. The navigation overlays in the upper left update, with the distances decreasing from 60M to 50M and 110M to 100M. A white van on the left, previously partially obscured, becomes clearer, and a new white car appears on the right sidewalk behind the initial white SUV. A person is also newly revealed walking on the right sidewalk, approaching the viewer.
