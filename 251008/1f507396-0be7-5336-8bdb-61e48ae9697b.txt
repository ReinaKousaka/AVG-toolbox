The first frame displays a night scene of a paved pedestrian street lined by buildings. To the viewer's left is a multi-story light-colored building with illuminated windows and retail storefronts below, adorned with string lights. Opposite, to the viewer's right, is a modern glass-fronted building with a long string of white lights horizontally across its upper facade, and potted plants in the immediate foreground. A red bollard stands in the middle distance of the path ahead, with other illuminated buildings and distant figures visible further down the street under a dark sky.

The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the paved street. Objects like the red bollard in the middle of the path and outdoor tables with potted plants on the right side become progressively closer and larger relative to the first-frame's initial positions. A circular, illuminated sign on the right building facade, initially obscured by the rightmost building's edge, gradually slides into full view and moves closer from a position further down the street on the right. Several people are observed walking along the distant path, mostly moving away from the viewer, while one person on the far left of the path slowly approaches the viewer's first-frame position.

The first frame depicts a paved pedestrian street at night, flanked by a multi-story building with string lights and illuminated windows on the left, and a modern glass-fronted building with a similar lighted awning and outdoor cafe furniture on the right, all extending into the distance from the viewer. In the mid-distance along the left side, decorative trees with lights and a few indistinct figures are visible further down the street relative to the viewer.
end of description
A person with a backpack appears from the immediate left foreground (from frame 4 onwards) and walks diagonally away from the viewer towards the mid-left of the street relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, another figure in the mid-distance, on the left side of the street near the trees, also moves further away from the initial viewpoint.

In the first frame, a person with a backpack, seen from behind, walks away from the viewer towards the center-left. To the left, a multi-story building with illuminated windows and festive lights over shopfronts extends into the background, with a modern, dark building behind it featuring purple-lit trees. To the right, a glass-fronted building with a canopy of string lights above also stretches into the distance, displaying Christmas trees inside its windows and large potted plants in the foreground. The cobblestone street occupies the bottom half of the frame, leading into the dark night sky.
end of description
The person in the foreground continuously walks away from the viewer, moving deeper into the scene along the pedestrian street. Simultaneously, a second person, initially in the mid-distance on the left side, progresses towards the viewer's position. This individual, dressed in dark attire and carrying a bag, moves past a red planter and closer to the foreground on the left side of the path. The first person gradually shrinks in size as they recede further into the illuminated streetscape.
