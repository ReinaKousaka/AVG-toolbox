The first frame shows a wet street stretching from the bottom center into the distance, flanked by buildings under an overcast sky. A wet sidewalk is visible to the right, where a white rectangular display unit with a transparent cover stands near the viewer's right. Numerous parked cars, including dark SUVs and vans, line the left side of the street in the midground, while two red A-frame signs are positioned on the right side of the road further away.

In subsequent frames, a white delivery truck slowly enters the scene from the far left, moving towards the viewer. Its front becomes visible in the bottom left corner by the fifth frame, and it continues to progress into the foreground on the left side of the wet street. No other significant objects or scene elements change dynamically relative to the initial viewpoint.

The first frame displays a wet urban street scene under an overcast sky, with buildings lining both sides. On the left, a white pickup truck with a green tarp covering its bed is parked among other cars, while on the right, two red signs stand on the sidewalk near a white outdoor display unit covered in plastic, closer to the viewer. end of description
The white pickup truck on the left begins to move forward and to the right, away from the viewer. Concurrently, a new, larger red sign appears on the far right, positioned closer to the viewer than the initial two signs. The truck continues its movement away from the viewer, progressively revealing more of the street and additional parked vehicles behind its original position on the left.

The first frame depicts a wet urban street with a white pickup truck, covered by a green tarp, driving away in the mid-ground, flanked by parked cars to the left and a sidewalk with two red A-frame signs to the right. Buildings line both sides of the street under a cloudy sky, and a large square manhole cover is visible on the wet asphalt in the foreground.

Subsequently, a man emerges from a doorway on the far right sidewalk and walks away from the viewer into the background. Simultaneously, the white pickup truck continues to drive away, eventually crossing yellow crosswalk lines in the distant mid-ground as the man also proceeds further down the right sidewalk.
