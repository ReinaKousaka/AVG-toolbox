The first frame captures a city street view. A white delivery van is partially visible in the foreground on the left, with a person standing on the crosswalk just to its right. Further down the street on the left, another white van is visible next to a building with scaffolding, while on the right, a wide sidewalk leads past a building with "Retail for Lease" signs and another ornate building displaying red flags and dark awnings, where several carts and people are present. Green traffic lights hang above the crosswalk, and tall skyscrapers rise in the hazy distance.

The person on the crosswalk in the mid-ground begins walking from left to right across the street. Concurrently, the second white delivery van, positioned further down the street on the left, starts driving away from the viewer. As the person continues to cross, a red car appears from the background on the far left, driving towards the viewer.

In the first frame, a city street extends into the background, flanked by tall buildings. To the left, a partial white car sits in the foreground, with a pedestrian crossing a crosswalk from left to right, followed by a red car. A traffic light pole with green lights stands mid-left, with a white delivery van further down the street. On the right, a sidewalk shows carts and people in the midground, leading past dark, ornate storefronts under awnings, and a large "Retail for Lease" sign on the far right. Tall buildings with scaffolding on the left and red flags on the right line the street into the distant background.
end of description
The person on the crosswalk (midground, left) continues walking from left to right and eventually exits the frame. The red car (midground, left) follows behind the person, moving forward and away from the viewer down the street. Simultaneously, the white delivery van (midground, center-left) proceeds further down the street. On the right sidewalk (midground, right), a person pushing a cart moves further away from the viewer.

The first frame displays a city street looking away from the viewer, with a crosswalk in the foreground left and tall buildings, some under construction, lining both sides of the avenue. A red car is visible in the mid-ground on the street, moving away from the viewer, beneath a green traffic light. On the right, a bustling sidewalk features several pedestrians, market stalls, and a storefront with an awning marked "142 W 57," adorned with dark red flags above.
end of description
The red car on the left side of the street continues to recede further into the distance away from the viewer. On the right sidewalk, pedestrians subtly shift their positions, with one person sitting down near the street vendor stalls in the mid-ground. The white truck also moves further away into the background.

The first frame presents a bustling city street with a sidewalk on the right, featuring pedestrians, storefronts, and banners displaying "142 W 57" in the upper right. To the left, a street with a crosswalk shows a traffic light pole with "6 1/2 Av" signage, a person sitting on the curb, and construction scaffolding further back, all flanked by tall city buildings extending into the background.
end of description.
As the viewpoint gradually moves forward, the woman pushing a cart on the right sidewalk progresses past the viewer, and cars on the street to the left also move forward. The entire urban landscape, including the seated person and vendor's display, appears to advance towards and past the viewer, continuously revealing more of the street ahead without introducing entirely new objects from previously unseen areas.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a bustling city street with a wide sidewalk on the right, featuring a pedestrian walking towards the viewer, another person pushing a cart away, and shopfronts with flags above. To the left, a narrower sidewalk holds a sitting person beside vendor items, a prominent traffic light pole with green lights and a "6 1/2 Ave" sign, bordering a street with vehicles and tall buildings under scaffolding.
end of description
During subsequent frames, the white delivery truck on the left drives forward, revealing more of the road, while the traffic lights transition from green to amber. Simultaneously, the pedestrian in the right foreground walks past the viewer and out of frame to the right, as another person pushing a cart recedes further down the right sidewalk.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a bustling city street flanked by tall buildings receding into the hazy background. On the right, the sidewalk features multiple hand trucks loaded with beverages next to a building with large display windows, while on the left street, a white box truck drives away from the viewer past a construction site.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the white box truck continues moving further away, and a dark SUV enters the street from the left-midground, driving past the initial truck's position and also away from the viewer. Simultaneously, a partially visible pedestrian on the right sidewalk begins walking forward, moving further into the scene and becoming more revealed.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a city street features carts with blue crates and red patterned boxes in the left foreground, next to a road with vehicles and construction scaffolding. On the right, a building with a dark awning and large, reflective storefront windows dominates the mid-ground, with a person's shoulder visible on the far right. Further down the sidewalk, a person pushes a hand truck, while distant skyscrapers rise in the hazy background.
end of description
The person partially visible on the far right in the first frame, wearing a light gray hoodie, begins walking forward, moving from the viewer's right foreground into the mid-ground. As they proceed along the sidewalk, they reveal more of their back and dreadlocks, continuing to move away from the viewer's original position. Their departure allows for a fuller view of the reflective storefront window on the right, which previously showed only a partial reflection.
