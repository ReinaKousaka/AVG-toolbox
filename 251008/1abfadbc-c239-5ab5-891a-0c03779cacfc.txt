First, a narrow, uphill cobblestone path is framed by towering stone walls on the left and right, with a wooden railing running along the lower left wall. At the path's crest, a person in a red backpack stands, flanked by a white building with a steeple to their left and another light-colored building to their right, all beneath an overcast sky.

The person then walks further uphill and disappears behind the crest of the path by frame five, leaving the path empty for the next three frames. Finally, a new individual in dark clothing emerges from behind the right stone wall at the path's crest, in the same general area where the first person was initially positioned.

The first frame displays a cobbled uphill path flanked by tall stone walls, receding from the viewer. At the top of the incline, a person in dark clothing is partially visible emerging from behind the right wall, with bare trees and distant buildings, including a white one with a spire, visible beyond the walls.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the person descends the path towards the viewer, fully revealing a man in a dark vest and cap. Concurrently, a second person in a red top becomes visible peeking over the right wall, remaining stationary in the distance. The man continues his descent towards the viewer, eventually adjusting his cap.

In the first frame, a cobblestone path slopes downwards towards the center of the scene, flanked by stone walls on both sides. On the left, a stone wall extends from the foreground with a metal handrail, while a similar stone wall runs from the midground on the right. A man wearing a dark vest, cap, and pants walks towards the viewer on the right side of the path, his right hand adjusting his cap. In the background, bare-branched trees stand against an overcast sky, with a white building featuring light blue shutters on the left and a light yellow-green building with dark green shutters on the right.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the man from the first frame continues walking towards the viewer, revealing a red backpack, before exiting the scene to the viewer's right. Concurrently, another person, also with a red backpack and now wearing a face mask, becomes visible emerging from behind the right stone wall and proceeds to walk further right. The scene slowly pulls back, revealing more of the cobblestone path and the full facades of the background buildings, which include a white building with blue shutters to the left and a yellow-green building with green shutters to the right.
