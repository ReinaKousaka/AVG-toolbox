In the first frame, the viewer looks forward along two parallel train tracks curving slightly to the right into the distance. To the immediate left, a stone retaining wall runs alongside the tracks, topped by a paved road with a guardrail, beyond which a steep, forested mountain rises. Overhead electrical lines and their supporting posts span across the tracks. To the right, a grassy bank slopes down to a body of water, bordered by a safety fence, with a large tree in the mid-ground. Distant mountains and a clear sky form the background.

As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks. Vehicles on the road to the left of the initial viewpoint approach and pass by, receding behind the original camera position. The stone retaining wall, guardrail, and grassy embankment beside the tracks continuously move from the foreground towards the left and right, passing the viewer. A new utility pole, bearing the '185m' marker, gradually appears from the left of the tracks and then passes the viewer's original position. The distant mountains and the body of water to the right steadily draw closer, slightly revealing more of their features.

The first frame depicts a train track curving gently to the right in the foreground, receding towards a distant mountain range with some snow-capped peaks on the horizon. Overhead electrical lines and poles frame the upper section, with a stone retaining wall, a grassy slope, and dense trees lining the left side of the track, and more trees bordering the right.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the immediate landscape, including the retaining wall, grassy slope, and trees on both sides, appears to move past the initial viewpoint towards its sides and behind. A triangular warning sign, initially indistinctly ahead on the left, becomes clearly visible as it approaches the first-frame viewpoint before receding left and behind it.
