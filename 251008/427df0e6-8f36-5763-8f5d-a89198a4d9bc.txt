In the first frame, a bright blue sky occupies the top half, meeting a deep blue sea on the left. Several boats are visible on the water: a white inflatable in the bottom-left foreground, another white inflatable slightly further left with an orange lifebuoy, and a larger orange and white boat with people aboard positioned further left. A rocky shoreline separates the water from the land on the right, where a dark car's hood is in the bottom-right foreground, followed by a dark grey sedan (Opel Insignia) in the mid-right, and other cars parked behind it. A large tree with yellowish-green foliage stands behind the cars on the right, with smaller bushes along the distant rocky coastline and faint mountains on the horizon across the water.
end of description
The driver's side door of the dark grey sedan, located to the right of the viewer, gradually opens across the sequence. By the fifth frame, the door is wide open, revealing a person's upper body inside the vehicle's interior. The door remains open for several frames before beginning to close slightly in the final frame.
