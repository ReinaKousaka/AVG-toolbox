The first frame displays a wide, multi-lane road stretching into the distance under a blue sky. Numerous parked cars line both sides of the road in the midground, with a row of trees and multi-story buildings directly behind them on the right, and similar greenery and structures further back on the left. In the far distance, several tall buildings are visible, with the most prominent one centered slightly left.

end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves continuously forward along the road. Consequently, objects initially close to the viewer, such as the first parked cars and trees on both sides, gradually move out of the frame towards the sides and eventually behind the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, new portions of the road, additional parked cars, and further sections of the buildings and trees on either side become visible *ahead* of the initial position. The distant tall buildings steadily grow larger, indicating the viewer's increasing proximity to them along the path ahead of the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a view down a city street on a sunny day. A multi-lane road with white dashed lines extends centrally into the distance, flanked by sidewalks and buildings. On the immediate left, a dark red car is partially visible, followed by a parked dark gray SUV, then a building partially obscured by green trees. On the right, a red pickup truck and a white pickup truck are parked, followed by more cars and green trees lining the street. In the mid-ground, several tall buildings rise, with a prominent light-colored skyscraper slightly to the left of center, and another modern building further right, all under a blue sky with scattered clouds.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the street, the red car on the left and the red and white pickup trucks on the right quickly disappear from view. The street's left side progressively reveals more of a large white building with multiple levels of windows and open parking garage sections, while on the right, additional parked cars come into view and then recede. Further down the right side, a row of palm trees and flags on poles emerge from behind the initial tree line, appearing closer to the viewer as the journey continues.

The first frame depicts a wide city street extending into the distance under a blue sky, flanked by parked cars and trees along both curbs. A multi-story building occupies the left foreground, while several skyscrapers rise in the background, notably one with a dark top in the center-left, and an intersection with traffic lights is visible further ahead.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. Objects initially on the left and right, such as parked cars and trees, recede, appearing further to the sides and slightly behind the viewer's initial position. The distant buildings and the intersection ahead gradually draw closer, and new road signs emerge on both the left and right sides of the street, moving closer into view.
