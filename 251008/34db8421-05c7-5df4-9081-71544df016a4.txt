A paved courtyard is visible, covered overhead by an extensive canopy of small, white rectangular lanterns, with some red lanterns to the far left. To the left, large, ornate orange and white lantern structures rest on a dark base, while a person in a light blue jacket stands near them, facing the viewer. Towards the right, a traditional building with a decorative green and brown railing features steps leading up to its entrance. In the mid-ground, a dark stone lantern-like structure stands behind the person, with various other buildings and a dark sky visible in the background.
end of description
The person in the light blue jacket steadily walks forward from their initial position, gradually moving closer to the viewer and slightly towards the center of the frame. No other significant dynamic changes or newly revealed objects occur throughout the sequence.
