In the first frame, a dark asphalt road occupies the foreground on the right, featuring white dashed lines, and is separated by a curb from a median with several orange traffic cones. To the left, a white pedestrian crosswalk is visible, with an orange and white barrel partly obscured in the bottom-left; beyond the crosswalk, a white sedan, a black sedan, and a dark SUV are stopped in sequence. Lush green trees line the left side, with a red traffic light on the far left, while more trees and an overcast sky define the background.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the stopped white sedan, black sedan, and dark SUV on the left begin to move and gradually exit the frame to the left. More orange cones lining the median are revealed ahead of the initial position. Concurrently, the road curves more prominently to the right, unveiling a grey bridge structure and another grey car appearing in the far right background as the movement continues.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame captures a paved road curving gently to the right, with white lane markings. To the left, a curb separates the main road from a narrower paved section, where several orange traffic cones are positioned, and a black SUV is parked further back. Green trees line both sides of the road, with an overcast sky above and distant buildings visible ahead on the right.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the initial black SUV and closer orange cones recede and exit the frame to the left. A new dark-colored SUV is revealed parked further down the road on the left, past the initial set of cones. The distant buildings on the right side of the road become slightly more distinct.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a road stretching forward from the viewer, with a paved sidewalk and a line of orange traffic cones to the viewer's left. A dark maroon SUV is parked on the left sidewalk near the cones, behind the viewer's immediate left. A dense line of green trees runs along the left side, beyond which a light-colored building is visible in the distance, connected by an arched pedestrian bridge over the road ahead. To the viewer's right, a brick building with green trees partially covers the upper right corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward. The maroon SUV, initially to the left, drives away from the viewer and disappears to the left. The orange traffic cones to the left move past the viewer, with new cones appearing further ahead. The white road markings approach and pass under the viewer, and the arched pedestrian bridge and distant buildings grow larger as the viewer travels towards them.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a road extending forward from the viewer, flanked by a curb and orange traffic cones on the left, and a sidewalk bordered by trees and a red brick building on the right. In the mid-ground, a stone archway spans the road, beyond which a long building stretches to the right. Green trees line both sides of the street, with parked cars visible to the far left and right, and an overcast sky overhead.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the road. The orange traffic cones and trees on both sides progressively recede past the viewer's fixed initial position. The archway and cars ahead appear to draw nearer, while a white domed structure slowly reveals itself emerging on the far left side of the scene from behind the trees, where it was initially obscured.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, the viewer is on a road looking forward, with white lane markings extending into the distance. To the left, a curb separates the road from a grassy area with green trees and parked cars, eventually leading to a white domed building in the mid-distance; several orange traffic cones line the curb. To the right, green trees partially obscure a reddish-brown brick building, with a '395' interstate sign mounted on a pole and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. Ahead, a long light-colored building spans the mid-ground, connecting to an arched bridge over the road, with an overcast sky overhead.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the road; the white lane markings and orange traffic cones on the left approach and pass out of view. Cars in the lanes ahead appear to move closer, while pedestrians on the right sidewalk also draw nearer and then pass behind the viewer's initial position. The large building and bridge in the distance steadily grow larger and more detailed, and a traffic light beneath the bridge cycles from red to green, then back to red, indicating ongoing traffic changes ahead.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a street view looking forward towards an intersection, with the road visible in the foreground. Orange traffic cones line the left curb, leading to parked and moving cars on the left, while a reddish-brown building and foliage occupy the right. Ahead, a long building with columns extends across the midground, connected by a stone archway to a building on the far left, with vehicles and pedestrians gathered at the intersection under an overhead red traffic light.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the viewer's perspective slowly advances forward along the road, causing all objects to appear slightly closer. The cars ahead, including a gray SUV on the right lane, subtly shift their positions and approach the viewer, and pedestrians continue to cross the street further ahead. The red traffic light under the archway remains illuminated, and no new scenes or significant objects are revealed.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a multi-lane urban intersection from the perspective of a vehicle stopped on the road, with orange traffic cones on a median to the viewer's left, and a gray SUV positioned immediately ahead to the right, followed by a white sedan. A red traffic light hangs below a stone archway connecting two large, classical-style buildings; pedestrians are actively crossing the crosswalk from the viewer's right, while a large green tree branch partially obstructs the upper right.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, pedestrians continue moving across the main intersection from right to left, gradually clearing the crosswalk. Cars in the distant intersection begin to move, with a light blue car emerging and proceeding to the viewer's far left, followed by a dark SUV turning left across that same distant intersection. A maroon sedan, previously partially obscured on the far left of the intersection, also moves forward into the distant intersection. Concurrently, the white sedan directly to the viewer's right slowly advances forward in its lane, while the gray SUV in front of it remains stationary, and the traffic light above the archway consistently displays red.
