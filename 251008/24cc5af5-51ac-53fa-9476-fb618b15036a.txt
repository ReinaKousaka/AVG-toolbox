A low stone wall with red rose bushes in the foreground stretches across the frame, behind which purple flowers, a green lawn, a wire fence, a white vehicle, and a thatched-roof house are visible in the background, with a large tree trunk on the right and dense foliage above.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly pans to the right, causing the white vehicle and house in the distant background to shift slightly leftward within the frame. Concurrently, the purple flowers on the far left of the stone wall gradually recede from view, while more red roses on the right side of the wall become visible, and additional green foliage beyond the tree on the right is progressively revealed.
