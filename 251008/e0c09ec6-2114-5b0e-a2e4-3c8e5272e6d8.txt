The first frame shows a road from a slightly elevated viewpoint, likely from inside a vehicle. A large modern building with reflective windows lines the left side, with a utility pole and green traffic lights situated in front of it. Directly in front of the viewer are white crosswalk stripes on the asphalt. On the right, further down the road, stands a multi-story commercial building featuring a prominent "LA VING" sign, with more buildings visible beyond it. Several vehicles are present further down the road ahead, and a person on a bicycle is visible on the far right, near the 'LA VING' sign. The sky above is clear and blue.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the viewer's position remains largely static. A person on a bicycle initially on the right side of the road, in front of the "LA VING" building, gradually cycles forward and slightly left, passing the crosswalk and moving further away. Simultaneously, a dark vehicle in the distance and a silver car on the right lane also advance forward along the road, becoming slightly closer to the viewer.

A street view in the first frame shows a crosswalk in the foreground, a bicyclist and a building with reflective windows on the left, and a multi-lane road with cars, commercial buildings, and "LAVING" signage on the right, all beneath a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the bicyclist and a traffic light pole, initially on the mid-left, recede and eventually move behind the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the white guardrail on the left and the large reflective building next to it appear to approach and then pass the initial viewpoint. Vehicles previously visible on the road continue to move further away, while a grey van appears from further down the road on the right and passes the first-frame viewpoint.

In the first frame, a road extends forward from the viewer, marked by a double yellow line. To the immediate left, a white guardrail with yellow chevron signs runs alongside a modern building with large glass windows, behind which residential houses and utility poles are visible. On the right, a multi-story commercial building with various storefronts is present, featuring a tall black sign with vertical "LIVING" text at its far right edge, and multiple smaller signs with a prominent red 'V' logo. Several dark cars are traveling away from the viewer on the road under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward along the road. The tall "LIVING" sign on the far right gradually exits the frame to the right, while the commercial building on the right becomes more fully visible, revealing new details like the "YAOKO MARKETPLACE" signage. Simultaneously, the dark car in the right lane moves further ahead and eventually out of frame to the right. On the left, the modern showroom building recedes, revealing a white banner with "New N-Box" text behind the guardrail. A 'STOP' marking on the road surface, to the right of the yellow lines, appears in the later frames.

The first frame depicts a clear blue sky above a paved road that stretches forward. To the left, a white guardrail runs parallel to the viewer, behind which are several residential houses and utility poles with overhead wires. Ahead on the road, a dark car is visible, while to the right, a large "YAOKO MARKETPLACE" building with a prominent red and white "YAOKO" sign stands alongside the road, with parked cars in its forecourt.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the road, guardrail, and utility poles on the left shift rearward, revealing more of the residential area, including a blue 'IN' sign and yellow chevron signs. The YAOKO marketplace on the right also recedes, showing more of its facade. A dark car initially ahead in the distance gradually moves closer. A new black vehicle emerges from the distant right lane, slowly approaching and then passing the viewer.

First, the viewer looks down a paved road with a black car ahead, while a black minivan is partially visible on the far right. To the left, a guardrail precedes residential buildings and a yellow chevron sign; to the right, a large commercial building with a tall Yaoko sign stands under a clear blue sky, traversed by utility lines. end of description.

As the viewer's vehicle moves forward, the black minivan on the right moves almost entirely out of frame. A pedestrian pushing a cart emerges more clearly on the right sidewalk, approaching the viewer's position. Simultaneously, a utility pole displaying a '40' speed limit and no-stopping sign appears and moves into view from the left as the road continues.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A road extends into the distance under a clear blue sky, flanked by a white guardrail and residential buildings on the left, and a multi-story commercial building with a parking entrance on the right. On the right sidewalk, a person pushing a cart walks away, while a dark car is ahead in the left lane, and another dark car approaches further away in the right lane.
end of description
As the viewer's vehicle advances, the pedestrian on the right sidewalk moves out of view, and the dark car in the right lane approaches, passes the viewer to the right, and then recedes behind them. The dark car previously in the left lane ahead maintains its relative distance, as the roadside buildings and utility poles continuously pass from foreground to background on both sides.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a straight road leading forward under a clear blue sky, flanked by a white guardrail on the left and a multi-story building on the right. Ahead, a black car occupies the road, with utility poles and wires overhead, while houses, a treeline, a white building, and a white van are visible on the left, and a pedestrian walks further down the right sidewalk.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, the guardrail, treeline, houses, and the white van on the left move towards and past the initial viewpoint, revealing more of the street scene. The black car maintains its position ahead on the road, while the pedestrian on the right sidewalk is approached and passed by the moving viewpoint, now appearing behind the initial position.
