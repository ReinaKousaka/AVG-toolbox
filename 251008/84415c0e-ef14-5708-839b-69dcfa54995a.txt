The first frame depicts an urban sidewalk scene where a paved walkway with yellow tactile strips extends from the foreground. To the right, a brown brick building houses a "VIVA" storefront with large glass windows, featuring a black chalkboard sign and an orange and white banner outside. On the left, a black utility pole with graffiti stands near several parked bicycles, and a person in a white coat walks away from the viewer down the sidewalk. In the background, a street with vehicles, traffic lights, and other multi-story buildings line the road under a bright sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk. The person in the white coat continues walking further away on the left, gradually receding into the distance. Concurrently, the digital display inside the storefront on the right cycles through several different advertisements. The black utility pole and parked bicycles move from the foreground towards the midground on the left, as more of the street and distant buildings are revealed ahead.
