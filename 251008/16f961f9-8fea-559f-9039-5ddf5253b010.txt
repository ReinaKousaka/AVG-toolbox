In the first frame, the viewer faces a multi-lane road stretching into the distance, with the inscription "Qinglu South Road" at the bottom left. To the left, a modern glass skyscraper dominates, flanked by palm trees, with other buildings receding further down the road and several cars driving away from the viewer. A wide grassy median separates the main road from a right-side area, featuring white chevron markings in the foreground, a tall cellular tower disguised as a palm tree in the mid-right, and multiple streetlights. Beyond the median to the far right, palm trees line a low gray barrier, behind which lies a body of water with distant land, and bicycles are parked near the barrier. A circular map overlay indicating the route and a 60 km/h speed limit is present in the top-left corner, all beneath a blue sky with scattered clouds.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the road. The white and gold cars on the left lane continue driving away, while the silver car in the right lane advances into the foreground, then angles right as if to turn or park. Simultaneously, the cellular tower and associated streetlights on the right median move progressively towards the right side of the frame as the viewer passes them. As the progression continues, more of the road ahead, additional streetlights, and new sections of the waterside scenery to the right are continuously revealed.

The first frame displays a multi-lane road extending into the distance under a clear blue sky with some white clouds. To the viewer's left, tall modern glass buildings are visible, fronted by a row of palm trees and several cars on the road. On the right, a wide grassy median with more palm trees separates the road from a body of water and a distant cityscape; a prominent utility pole with antennas stands near the foreground right, and a silver car is parked partially on the striped shoulder. Streetlights line both sides of the road, and a navigation map is overlaid in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The silver car parked on the right shoulder and the large utility pole on the far right gradually recede and move out of frame to the right. Simultaneously, the streetlights and palm trees on the right shift towards the right edge, revealing more of the grassy embankment and the bay beyond. Further ahead, a speed limit sign and a blue G228 road sign become increasingly prominent on the right side of the road as the viewer approaches them. The buildings on the left and cars in the distance also appear closer with this forward progression.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a straight road, with modern glass buildings, palm trees, parked bicycles, and moving cars on the left. To the right, a grassy area with palm trees overlooks a body of water and distant city skyline, featuring a prominent lamppost and street signs with 'G228' and a 'no parking' symbol near the viewer.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the lamppost and street signs on the right to approach and then pass the viewer. Concurrently, a blue and white structure on the right-side grassy area becomes increasingly visible as the vehicle continues its path.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a multi-lane road, 'Qinglu South Road', extending away from the viewer, flanked by modern high-rise buildings and a row of palm trees on the left. To the right, a grassy embankment features more palm trees and an abstract blue and white sculpture, beyond which a body of water with distant land is visible under a clear blue sky. Two cars are ahead on the road, moving away from the viewer. A circular map overlay is in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The blue and white abstract sculpture on the right moves closer to the viewer and eventually out of frame to the right, replaced by more grassy embankment and palm trees further ahead. Concurrently, the high-rise buildings and palm trees on the left advance towards and past the viewer. A "70" speed limit sign, initially small ahead on the right, approaches and then passes the viewer's right side.
