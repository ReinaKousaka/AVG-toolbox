The first frame shows a multi-lane wet road at night, with a prominent zebra crosswalk extending across the foreground directly in front of the viewer. Buildings with illuminated signs, including "BURGER KING" on the left, line both sides of the street, while streetlights and trees stretch into the distant background. Several cars with bright headlights are visible in the midground, approaching the viewer on the wet asphalt.

As the frames progress, the approaching cars on the multi-lane road, in front of the viewer, move slowly closer, their headlights casting increasingly vibrant reflections on the wet asphalt. A new white car appears on the far right lane, in front and to the right of the viewer, slowly moving away from the first-frame viewpoint towards the background. The overall scene maintains its rainy night ambiance with slight shifts in light reflections.

The first frame captures a wet city street at night from a pedestrian crosswalk, looking down a long road. Illuminated buildings and trees line both sides of the street, reflecting off the wet pavement. A white sedan is stationary to the left, and a white minivan/SUV is stationary to the right, both in the foreground lanes.

Subsequently, both the white sedan on the left and the white minivan/SUV on the right begin to move forward along the road. The sedan proceeds into the distant left, while the minivan progresses to position its rear towards the center-right of the crosswalk from the first viewpoint.

The first frame shows a wet city street at night, illuminated by numerous streetlights and building signs, creating colorful reflections on the asphalt. In the immediate foreground, a white pedestrian crossing with thick stripes extends across the road. A white SUV is parked on the right side of the road, facing away from the viewer, with several other vehicles visible further down the street on the left. Buildings with various glowing signs line both sides of the road, receding into the distance under a dark sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward over the pedestrian crossing. The parked white SUV on the right appears to approach the viewer and subtly shifts towards the center of the frame. A traffic light, initially just beyond the mid-right edge, fully enters the scene and transitions from unlit/red to green. Simultaneously, more details of the sidewalk and buildings on the right side become visible, while the overall street scene continues to recede into the distance.
