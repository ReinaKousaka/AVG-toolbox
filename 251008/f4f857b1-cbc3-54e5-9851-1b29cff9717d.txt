The first frame captures a vibrant, crowded Japanese pedestrian street at night, with the back of a person's head and right shoulder visible on the far right, and a man with a blue backpack and other pedestrians in the mid-left foreground. The midground and background feature brightly lit shops adorned with numerous Japanese signs, including a prominent yellow one on the right, while a large green dragon sculpture with white cloud-like decorations sits high on the far upper right, above a red building.

As the frames progress, the camera steadily moves forward and slightly to the right, revealing more of the bustling street ahead and to the left. The initial foreground pedestrians move out of view towards the left, while new individuals continually emerge into the frame from behind the camera's original position and from further down the street on both sides, maintaining the lively atmosphere.

The viewer is positioned within a bustling, covered market street, looking forward. In the immediate foreground, to the left, is the back of a person wearing a plaid shirt. The midground features a diverse crowd of people walking in various directions, including a man in a plaid shirt and a woman with a black backpack prominently on the left. To the right, a bright red-fronted building with large yellow and black signs advertising food stands, houses a visible restaurant with patrons inside. The street extends into the background, lined with numerous shops, banners, and bright signs under an arched ceiling with artificial lighting.

The camera gradually moves forward along the street, causing the entire scene to shift relative to the first-frame viewpoint. People and objects initially in the mid-ground, such as the man in the plaid shirt and the woman with the black backpack, move progressively closer to the original viewpoint and then past it, eventually exiting the frame or moving towards the foreground. Concurrently, other pedestrians traverse the walkway, continually moving past the initial viewpoint in various directions. As the camera advances, the red restaurant and other static elements on both sides of the street appear to recede further into the distance relative to the first-frame viewpoint, and previously obscured sections of the covered walkway ahead become visible.
