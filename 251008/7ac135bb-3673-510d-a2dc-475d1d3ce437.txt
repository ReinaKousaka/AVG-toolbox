In the first frame, a traditional Chinese building entrance, characterized by a dark tiled roof and red lanterns, dominates the mid-left, flanked by a dark brick wall to its left and a modern grey apartment building rising behind it. A paved sidewalk with a yellow curb extends from the lower left towards the right, leading to a street lined with parked cars and trees with yellow leaves in the distant background. A banner displaying Chinese characters hangs from the traditional roof structure, with a bicycle and stacked yellow boxes positioned near the entrance's gate.
end of description
The white banner hanging from the traditional roof structure progressively sways from its initial position to the right relative to the viewer, revealing more of its surface. Simultaneously, a person on the sidewalk to the right of the traditional building's entrance gradually bends down towards the ground. The banner continues to swing rightwards before slowly beginning to return towards its original central alignment. The person remains crouched on the sidewalk throughout the later frames.
