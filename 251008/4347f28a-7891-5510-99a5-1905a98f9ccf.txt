The first frame shows the viewer facing a narrow, stone-paved alleyway flanked by buildings. To the right, a weathered grey wall with peeling paint has a window with a rusted metal grate and a light pink drainpipe, while to the left, a lighter building presents a dark metal gate and barred window. Further ahead, the alley narrows between more buildings, with streetlights visible overhead.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the street, causing the textured right wall and the gated left building to appear closer before receding past the viewer's position. This forward movement reveals new segments of the alley and additional features on the walls further ahead, maintaining the perspective relative to the initial viewpoint.

The first frame captures a narrow cobblestone street extending into the distance, flanked by buildings. To the viewer's left, a yellowish-orange building features a dark ornate metal gate in the foreground, while a weathered gray building with a barred window and a reddish pipe stands to the viewer's right. The text "Via San Pietro" is displayed at the bottom left.
end of description
As the camera moves forward along the street, the dark gate disappears from view to the initial left, revealing more of the yellow building including the number '50' and additional entrances on that side. Concurrently, the weathered gray building extends further to the initial right, with its barred window receding into the mid-right relative to the initial viewpoint. The street progressively narrows and curves further into the distance, revealing more of the converging buildings ahead.

The first frame displays a narrow, paved alleyway extending straight ahead from the viewer, flanked by tall buildings. To the immediate left, a light yellow building features a large arched black metal gate, set slightly back, followed by a window with closed dark green shutters and a matching door further down. On the viewer's right, a weathered grey building with peeling paint and moss has a prominent window with an ornate metal grate in the mid-ground. The stone-paved alley continues into the distance, appearing to curve slightly left towards a brighter area, with a street lamp visible on the right wall mid-alley.
end of description
The viewer progressively moves forward into the alley. As the scene unfolds, the arched black gate on the left and the grated window on the right move out of frame to the sides, no longer visible from the first-frame viewpoint. A new address number, "52", becomes visible on the yellow building above where the gate was, and the dark green shutters and door on the left, along with the street lamp on the right, become significantly closer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a narrow, paved alley stretching into the distance. To the viewer's immediate left is a light yellow building with a dark green window and door, both having closed shutters, and a beige pipe running vertically. On the right, a taller, distressed grey building with visible cracks and moss-like discoloration recedes, its lower half painted darker, with a thin pipe running along its side.
end of description
The scene dynamically moves forward through the alley; the yellow building on the left and the cracked grey wall on the right gradually slide past the viewer, revealing a small balcony with plants further down on the left side, and bringing previously distant elements like the street lamp closer into view before they too pass behind the viewer. The cobblestone path continually unfolds, revealing more of the alley ahead as the viewpoint steadily advances deeper into the street.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a narrow cobblestone alleyway extending forward into the distance. To the immediate left is a light yellow building wall, partially showing a dark green shuttered window at its edge and a black mailbox and house number '54' further back. Behind this, a reddish-brown building with a plant-filled balcony is visible. To the right, a weathered grey building with peeling paint presents a dark brown door and a window with a grey louvered shutter above it, with a street lamp extending from its upper wall further down. The paved alley floor recedes towards a brighter opening in the far background.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses steadily forward through the alley, effectively moving into the scene. The initial dark green shuttered window on the far left and the house number '54' recede and move out of view to the left of the viewer's original position. Simultaneously, the black mailbox and the window with the grey louvered shutter on the right also recede, eventually exiting the frame. As the viewer advances, more of the reddish-brown building on the left and the weathered grey building on the right are continuously revealed, moving closer to the viewer's original position. The distant bright opening in the alley appears larger and closer with each step.
