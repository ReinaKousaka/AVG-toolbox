The first frame presents a narrow Japanese street or alley on a sunny day. To the viewer's immediate left, a large, light-colored roll-up shutter covers the lower portion of a building, above which is a weathered wooden wall section with an awning. An outdoor air conditioning unit sits at ground level in front of the shutter, topped by a green watering can. Extending from this building, centrally positioned on the left, is a small annex-like structure featuring a wooden door, a concrete block base, and a small window, with an air conditioning unit mounted higher on its wall. The asphalt road extends forward and slightly to the right, showing yellow markings, while the right side of the street is lined with a wall heavily covered in green climbing plants. Utility poles and wires crisscross against the clear blue sky, and a white vehicle is visible far down the curving street in the background.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly right along the narrow street. Consequently, the white shutter and the air conditioning unit on the far left of the first frame gradually recede towards the left edge. A new white rectangular object emerges on the upper left wall, moving into view as the camera advances. The small annex structure on the left and the street extending into the distance appear incrementally closer. The distant white vehicle and the green foliage on the right also draw slightly nearer as the camera progresses.

The first frame depicts a narrow street under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left, a green watering can rests on the ground next to a weathered wooden door, above which is a wooden wall section with a small window. Below the window, a light-colored block wall displays a blue sign and a yellow sign; further down this wall, a narrow wooden gate is visible, adjacent to a two-story building. To the right, the street extends into the distance, bordered by a building densely covered in green foliage and numerous potted plants on shelves, with a white car visible far down the street. Utility poles with extensive wiring crisscross overhead in the mid-distance.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the street, causing the initial left-side building with the watering can to gradually exit the frame to the left. The blue and yellow signs on the block wall, initially on the mid-left, become larger and then recede leftward as the narrow gate beside them becomes more centrally visible on the left. Concurrently, the street ahead and the buildings on the right, adorned with dense foliage and potted plants, become more detailed and prominent, extending further into the frame from the right. The white car in the distance slightly approaches, and overhead utility poles shift relatively to the right of the frame.

The first frame presents a narrow street bordered by buildings under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left is a concrete block wall with a brown gate, displaying a yellow sign, while a multi-story building rises behind it. On the right, a building is extensively covered in green ivy, with numerous potted plants lining its base, and a white car is visible in the distance at the end of the street, beneath a network of power lines.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the street. The concrete wall and brown gate on the left recede and eventually move out of frame, while the ivy-covered building on the right appears closer, revealing more of its facade and further potted plants on the right as the perspective advances.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a narrow, sunlit residential street with buildings lining both sides and utility poles with wires overhead against a clear blue sky. On the immediate left is a concrete block wall partially obscured by sunlight and a brown metal gate, while the right features a building with an air conditioning unit, windows, and extensive green foliage. A small white vehicle is visible far down the street at its curving end.
end of description
As the camera moves forward down the street, the concrete wall and brown gate on the initial left progressively recede from view. New segments of the buildings on both sides, previously further ahead of the viewer's initial position, are revealed and become clearer, while the distant white vehicle gradually appears closer to the viewer's advancing position.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a narrow street flanked by residential buildings under a clear blue sky, with a brown slatted fence and a white building with windows on the immediate left, and green foliage, white pots, and a darker building with a balcony on the immediate right, all receding towards distant utility poles and a white vehicle.
end of description
As the viewer advances, objects previously in the foreground, like the brown fence and white utility unit on the initial left, and the foliage and pots on the initial right, progressively move towards and then past the viewer's original position. The buildings flanking the street, including the white structure on the left and the darker one with a balcony on the right, appear to grow larger and shift past the viewpoint, revealing more of their facades further down the street.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a narrow street flanked by residential buildings under a bright blue sky. A light grey building wall with a utility box and door occupies the left foreground, while an older structure with a closed garage shutter and an upper balcony is to the right, with the street curving into the distance ahead.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the viewpoint moves steadily forward down the street. This progression brings the surrounding buildings, like the utility box on the left wall and the right-side garage door, closer to the viewer and enlarges their appearance within the frame as the street ahead gradually becomes more detailed.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a narrow residential street lined with multi-story white houses under a clear blue sky, featuring numerous utility poles and overhead wires. On the left, a building with a large grey sliding door is visible, while on the right, a white house with a roll-up shutter and a dark metal gate stands, with a crumpled yellow tarp on the ground nearby.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, the camera moves forward down the street. A dark vehicle gradually becomes visible to the left, parked behind a concrete structure that was previously obscured. Concurrently, a white rectangular sign with Japanese characters and a smaller green sign on a utility pole further down the street emerge and become more prominent on the left side relative to the initial frame's position.
