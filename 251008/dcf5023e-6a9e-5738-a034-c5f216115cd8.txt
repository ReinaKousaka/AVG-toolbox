In the first frame, a large, bare-branched tree trunk extends diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right, partially obscuring a modern, two-story house with reddish-brown wood siding and large windows, situated in the midground. A bird feeder hangs near the center-left of the house's exterior, and a wooden bench rests below a lower-left window. To the far left is a lighter-colored house and a wooden fence, while to the far right, another house and fence are largely obscured by the foreground tree and main house. The ground directly in front of the viewer is a paved area, and the sky overhead is overcast.
end of description
The camera slowly pans to the right and slightly pulls back, revealing more of the scene. The large tree trunk, initially prominent from the top-left to the bottom-right, gradually shifts further to the right, exposing more of the modern house's exterior and reducing its obstruction. Consequently, the house to the right of the main structure, previously largely obscured, becomes increasingly visible to the right of the main house. The paved ground in front of the modern house also expands slightly in view towards the right.
