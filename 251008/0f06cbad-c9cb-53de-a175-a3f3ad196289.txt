The first frame shows a wet, reddish-brown street with white crosswalk stripes extending from the viewer towards the background. On the right, a reddish-brown sidewalk parallels the street, featuring a dark utility pole with a red traffic light. A white sedan is prominently positioned in the lower-left, partially on the crosswalk, while another white sedan is further down the road to the left. To the right, a silver/light-colored taxi is stopped on the crosswalk. On the left, modern buildings with greenery line the street, leading to more buildings and utility poles receding into the distant background under a cloudy sky.

The white sedan in the lower-left moves forward, away from the viewer and partially off-screen to the left. Subsequently, a white BMW sedan appears behind it on the left, also moving forward. Meanwhile, a dark SUV emerges from the distant background, steadily approaching the viewer in the mid-left area of the street, while the silver taxi on the right remains stopped on the crosswalk. By the final frames, a blue car is newly visible to the far right, positioned behind the stationary taxi.

The first frame displays a wet road with a prominent pedestrian crossing in the foreground. A dark grey SUV is positioned on the lower left, while a silver taxi sits centrally on the crossing, both facing left. To the far right, a blue car is partially visible, with residential buildings and utility infrastructure filling the background under an overcast sky.
end of description
The dark grey SUV and silver taxi progressively move left and exit the frame. Concurrently, the blue car on the right advances forward, crosses the pedestrian area towards the left, and is then followed by a white car emerging from the right, as other distant vehicles also move closer down the street.

In the first frame, a wet, red-painted street with a white crosswalk is visible in the foreground, with a blue hatchback positioned centrally on the crosswalk, a black sedan turning left from the viewer's left, and another black car further down the road, flanked by buildings and utility poles under an overcast sky.
end of description
The blue hatchback then moves left and away from the viewer, revealing a white sedan parked further down the street on the right. Subsequently, the first black sedan proceeds onto the crosswalk, also moving left and away from the viewer, while the second black car behind it moves closer, following the same path. Both black vehicles continue their forward trajectory, their headlights reflecting on the wet pavement as they pass through the scene.
