The first frame depicts a snow-covered city street at night, with a person in a dark coat walking away from the viewer on the right sidewalk. To the left, a tall building with lit windows borders a snowy road, while flashing red emergency lights and a large architectural building are visible in the distant center, with storefronts lining the midground right.

In subsequent frames, the primary person on the right sidewalk continuously moves further away from the first-frame viewpoint, receding into the midground. Simultaneously, several other pedestrians become visible, emerging from what was previously behind the initial person, also moving into the distance along the right sidewalk.

The first frame shows a snowy city street at night, with a tall, illuminated building to the viewer's far left and a commercial building with display windows on the right. A snow-covered sidewalk in the foreground leads into the mid-ground, where several pedestrians walk away from the viewer towards a distant, brightly lit building with an arched entrance.

The pedestrians initially on the right and center-left move further away from the first-frame viewpoint, passing the viewer and exiting the frame on the right and left, respectively. As they depart, new pedestrians and individuals pulling red luggage become visible on the sidewalk in the mid-ground, moving away from the viewer towards the distant background building.

The first frame displays a snowy city street at night. A snow-covered sidewalk occupies the foreground right, bordered by a snow-covered bank on the left, separating it from a partially visible, snow-covered road. To the right, a multi-story building features illuminated storefront windows displaying advertisements, with pedestrians walking away from the viewer on the sidewalk. On the far left, another tall building with many lit windows stands, and in the distant center, a large, ornate building with an arched entrance and clock tower is visible, all under a dark night sky with various streetlights illuminating the scene.
end of description
As the camera moves forward along the snowy sidewalk, pedestrians previously in the mid-ground right approach and pass the viewer to the right. A woman in a beige fur coat, initially ahead, moves into the foreground and then exits the frame to the right. More individuals, some pulling red and black luggage, are revealed coming from the mid-ground right towards and past the viewer. The illuminated storefronts to the viewer's right recede, bringing the building's main entrance into closer view, while cars on the road to the left also progress forward.
