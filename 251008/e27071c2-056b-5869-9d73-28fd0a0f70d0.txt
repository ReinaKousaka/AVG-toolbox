The first frame displays a forest path made of rocks, leading into a dense woodland. In the foreground, a prominent cut tree stump is slightly right of center, flanked by a large log segment to its left and green foliage on the far right. Tall, slender trees with green canopies dominate the midground and background, rising towards an overcast sky, with more fallen logs and rocks scattered throughout the forest floor.
