In the first frame, a wet, rain-soaked urban street at night is visible. Closest to the viewer on the left, a white and black scooter is parked on the sidewalk. To the right, a sidewalk borders a street, both reflecting the city lights. Across the street, a grey SUV with its rear facing the viewer is prominent, with other cars further down the road and parked along the right side, including a dark SUV with hazard lights on. Buildings with glowing neon signs (pink, green, blue) line the distant background, obscured by heavy rain, while streetlights and trees punctuate the scene.

Beginning in the second frame, a dark umbrella starts to descend from above the viewer, progressively entering the top of the frame. By the third and fourth frames, the umbrella covers more of the upper scene, further obscuring the distant sky and the tops of background buildings. This downward movement continues until the seventh frame, where the umbrella settles, consistently framing the upper portion of the view, while heavy rain persists across the entire scene.
