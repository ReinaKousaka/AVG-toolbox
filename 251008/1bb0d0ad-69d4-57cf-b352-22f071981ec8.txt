In the first frame, a group of people walks away from the viewer down a street under a cloudy sky, with the closest individual holding a bright blue umbrella. To the immediate left is an orange fence and a grey building, while a beige and brown building with a dark gate is on the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward with the group. A red 'STOP' sign on a pole becomes visible further down the street to the mid-left, beyond the initial orange fence. More of the grey building on the left is revealed, and white arrow road markings appear on the red-paved street surface below where the group is walking.

First, a person holding a bright blue umbrella is seen from behind, walking away from the viewer on a wet road with white markings, flanked by a gray building wall and an orange fence on the left, and distant trees and a beige building on the right under an overcast sky.
end of description
The group of people, including the person with the blue umbrella, continues walking further away from the viewer. A second person, carrying a black umbrella, emerges to the left of the blue umbrella as they proceed. Subsequently, a white truck with a brown cab becomes visible in the distance, approaching from the right side of the road and moving across the scene relative to the first-frame viewpoint. As the truck passes, additional individuals emerge from behind the umbrellas, continuing to walk forward on the path.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents an overcast street scene with a gray tiled building wall to the immediate left. Ahead and to the right, a group of people with black and a prominent blue umbrella walk away on a sidewalk, while a light-colored delivery truck with a green cab drives away on the road further in front, with utility poles and trees in the background.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the truck continues to move forward, away from the viewer and turning slightly to the right, revealing more of its side. The group of people with umbrellas also progresses further away from the viewer, and a smiling man previously partially obscured on the far left becomes fully visible as he walks away from the initial viewpoint.

In the first frame, a bright blue umbrella held by a person walking away from the viewer occupies the bottom right corner, while a group of other pedestrians with various colored umbrellas (black, white, and darker blue) walk ahead of them in the center-right foreground. To the far left, a light-colored building wall with some green foliage at its base is visible. In the midground, a green and white delivery truck with illuminated headlights moves from right to left, positioned to the right of the walking group. Behind the pedestrians, a utility pole laden with wires, a red inverted triangle stop sign, and a blue pedestrian crossing sign stands next to a multi-story building with light brown siding and an external staircase on the left. The background reveals dense green trees under an overcast sky.

end of description

The green and white delivery truck continues moving from right to left, eventually disappearing entirely from the frame to the left of the original viewpoint. Concurrently, the group of pedestrians, including the prominent blue umbrella in the foreground, steadily walks forward and further away from the original viewpoint. As they advance, a person wearing a white top and a black backpack becomes more distinctly visible among the central pedestrians. The overall perspective slightly shifts forward as the street ahead gradually reveals more space.

The first frame captures a rainy street scene. To the immediate left, green foliage is visible, followed by a building with light brown siding and a darker structure with exposed stairs. Overhead, numerous utility poles and wires stretch across the frame, with a red stop sign and a blue pedestrian crossing sign attached to one pole in the mid-left. A group of people, mostly carrying dark umbrellas, are walking away from the viewer in the midground center, with one person on the far right holding a bright blue umbrella. To the mid-right, a white delivery truck with a black cat logo and Japanese text is parked, behind which a line of dark green trees can be seen under an overcast sky.
end of description
The group of people continues to walk away from the viewer, gradually moving further down the path and slightly to the right. As they advance, a person wearing a bright yellow high-visibility vest becomes more distinctly visible further ahead in the background. The buildings and utility poles on the left remain in their relative positions, suggesting a subtle forward movement by the viewer while maintaining their perspective behind the group.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows the viewer from behind a group of people holding umbrellas, walking along a street. To the viewer's left is a building with a corrugated metal facade and a concrete wall, while ahead, two road signs (a red stop sign and a blue pedestrian crossing sign) stand beneath power lines, with dense trees in the background.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the building and wall on the left to gradually recede from view. A person in a yellow safety vest, initially obscured further down the street to the right of the group, becomes increasingly visible, and the road signs ahead appear closer as the group advances.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A group of people holding umbrellas are walking away from the viewer on a sidewalk to the right, next to a light-colored brick wall with a dark structure above it on the left. In the mid-ground, a red triangular 'STOP' sign is positioned above a blue rectangular pedestrian crossing sign on a pole, with lush green trees and a white bridge railing visible in the background under an overcast sky.
end of description
The people steadily move forward, revealing more of the street and the white bridge railing to the mid-right. Concurrently, a poster becomes visible on the left wall, and a person wearing a dark blue shirt with a white '7' on the back becomes prominent within the walking group as they advance.
