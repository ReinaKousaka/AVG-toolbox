A person with long blonde hair, wearing a grey and white top, is visible in the foreground to the right, facing away from the viewer on a grey paved walkway. In the midground, a person on a skateboard moves forward, away from the viewer, while a row of trees lines the left side of the path, and a brightly lit urban area with buildings and other people is visible in the background.

The foreground person begins to walk forward. By the fourth frame, a man with dark hair, glasses, and a white shirt appears to the right of the first person, moving from the right side of the frame into view and placing his hand on their back. Both individuals then continue walking forward, away from the first-frame viewpoint, as the skateboarder in the midground also progresses further down the path.

The first frame shows a night scene on a paved walkway, with two individuals in the foreground, slightly right of center, walking away from the viewer. To the left, a row of trees with dark trunks and dense green foliage lines the path, some displaying posters on their bases, while another row of similar trees is visible further down the path on the right. In the mid-distance and background, a city street with buildings, illuminated by streetlights and shop lights, stretches into the horizon, with several vehicles and other pedestrians scattered throughout.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly advances forward along the walkway. The two main individuals in the foreground continue walking away, maintaining their relative positions to each other, moving further into the mid-distance. A skateboarder, initially observed in the mid-ground right of the first-frame viewpoint, steadily moves closer to the right side of the path, eventually passing to the right of the original viewpoint. Distant figures on the street and walkway also shift their positions, indicating ongoing pedestrian and vehicle traffic further ahead.

The first frame depicts a paved walkway extending forward from the viewer, flanked by large tree trunks with green foliage on both sides. In the center-midground, two people – a woman with long blonde hair on the left and a man with a black backpack on the right – walk away from the viewer. In the background, illuminated buildings and streetlights line a distant street under a dark night sky.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the two individuals continue walking further away from the viewer along the paved walkway, receding into the midground. As they progress, more of the distant illuminated buildings and the path ahead become visible in the mid-to-background from the first-frame viewpoint.
