The first frame captures a street scene featuring a traditional Japanese-style building on the mid-right with white walls, dark wood accents, and a tiled roof, extending to the far right where a white tarp covers a section. In front of it, a blue trash can and signs with Japanese text are visible. A paved street extends into the background from the lower center, with a narrow sidewalk running alongside the traditional building. Several people, including a cyclist on the mid-left and a pedestrian in light clothing on the mid-right sidewalk, are moving away from the viewer down the street, towards a tall, modern brown building dominating the upper left background.

Throughout the following frames, the main dynamic change is the continued movement of individuals away from the first-frame viewpoint. The person on the bicycle on the mid-left cycles further down the street into the background. Concurrently, the person in light-colored clothing on the mid-right sidewalk walks further away, progressing along the street past the traditional building. Other figures also continue moving further into the distance along the street.
