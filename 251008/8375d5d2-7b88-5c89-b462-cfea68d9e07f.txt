First frame: A wet asphalt street with "30" speed limit markings and a crosswalk is in the foreground, leading towards buildings under an overcast sky. To the left, a dark blue SUV is parked next to a multi-story grey building, while storefronts with yellow awnings and a prominent red sign line the sidewalk to the right. A person holding a black umbrella is mid-crossing the street from left to right, with a white sedan visible further down the road.
end of description
The person with the umbrella continues walking across the wet street from left to right, moving further from the viewer. The distant white sedan also progresses further away, and a black sedan newly appears behind the person, traveling in the same direction. The dark blue SUV remains parked to the left, and the yellow traffic lights stay constant throughout the sequence.

The first frame depicts a wet street scene on an overcast day, looking down a road. To the viewer's immediate right, a building facade with a prominent yellow awning, white display boards, and a red-bordered sign is visible. The wet asphalt road, marked with a white crosswalk and Korean text, extends from the foreground into the distance, showing a partial '30' speed limit sign. On the left side of the road, a multi-story grey building stands behind a parked dark blue SUV; a person holding a black umbrella walks across the crosswalk in front of it, while another dark SUV drives towards the viewer further down the road.
end of description
The traffic light in the upper left corner illuminates yellow. The person with the black umbrella, initially on the left side of the crosswalk, moves progressively across it and exits the frame to the left. Concurrently, the dark SUV, previously further down the road on the left, drives forward towards the viewer, crossing the center of the crosswalk. As it moves past, a new white car appears on the far left, behind the initial position of the pedestrian, also advancing towards the viewer. Both the dark SUV and the white car continue driving past the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame reveals a wet city street under an overcast sky, with a pedestrian crossing and Korean text painted in the foreground. A dark SUV is positioned left of the crossing with a silver car behind it, a white delivery truck drives uphill in the center, and to the right, a sidewalk holds a storefront with a yellow awning, kiosk, and picnic table.
end of description
The dark SUV progressively moves forward and exits the frame to the left. The silver car then takes its place at the crossing, subsequently driving forward and out of view. Simultaneously, a yellow school bus appears behind the white delivery truck in the mid-ground, continuing to ascend the road.
