The first frame displays a street scene from a walking perspective. In the immediate foreground to the right, the back of a person in a black cap and a yellow and black jacket is seen moving away. To the immediate left, a large glass storefront with an overhead awning occupies the frame, reflecting objects. Along the left midground, a row of commercial buildings with illuminated signs, including a prominent marquee, stretches into the distance, with several pedestrians and a dog walking on the sidewalk. On the right midground, a street runs parallel to the sidewalk, showing a yellow taxi and a dark bus further ahead, with leafless trees spaced along the curb. In the background, modern city buildings are visible under an overcast sky.

As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the sidewalk. The person in the yellow and black jacket on the right moves further away and partially out of frame. The storefronts on the left become progressively closer, revealing more of their glass and interior as the viewer approaches. Pedestrians and a dog walking ahead on the sidewalk appear larger as the distance to them decreases, and the street with vehicles continues to unfold.

The first frame depicts a bustling city street and wet sidewalk, extending forward from the viewer. To the immediate left is a building with reflective glass and a tiled base, topped by a prominent red "COMMODORE BALLROOM" neon sign and a golden awning, while pedestrians and a person with a dog occupy the midground on the sidewalk ahead.
end of description
The scene then slowly shifts right, bringing the "COMMODORE BALLROOM" sign and a newly revealed "BOX OFFICE" entrance on the left building more into view. Simultaneously, the group of pedestrians, including the dog, moves forward and to the right relative to their initial positions, as a bus also progresses further down the street to the right.

The first frame displays a vibrant city street scene, with the viewer positioned on the sidewalk. To the immediate left, a building featuring a dark tiled base and a "COMMODORE Ballroom" neon sign partially frames a group of pedestrians, including a gray dog, gathered on the sidewalk in front of multiple storefronts. Directly ahead, a multi-lane street recedes into the distance, with a large bus partially visible on the right, a bare tree with reddish leaves, and numerous city buildings under an overcast sky.

end of description

As the sequence unfolds, the large bus on the right side of the street progresses forward, gradually moving out of view towards the right of the frame. A yellow taxi cab is subsequently revealed behind the departing bus, also moving away from the first-frame viewpoint. Minor shifts in the positions of the pedestrians on the left sidewalk are observed, but their general gathering remains largely static.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a bustling city street with a wide sidewalk on the left, occupied by a queue of pedestrians outside a brightly lit storefront with an awning and a prominent marquee for "THE EMBASSY" above, alongside a large blue 'M' sign. In the mid-ground, a person with a grey dog stands near the queue, while the street on the right features a green bus, a yellow taxi, and distant buildings under an overcast sky, with a tree displaying reddish leaves on the far right.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the people on the sidewalk and the person with the dog remain largely static, while vehicles like the green bus and yellow taxi move further down the street to the right. The red reflections on the wet pavement in the mid-ground right noticeably shift and extend, indicating continuous traffic flow, and new parts of the street and distant cars are subtly revealed as foreground vehicles progress forward.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a city sidewalk scene, with a prominent "Brandy Melville" shop window and a line of masked pedestrians stretching along the left side, beneath an awning displaying "INTERMISSION IS OVER." In the midground right, a person with a grey dog stands on the sidewalk, while further right, a street unfolds with a yellow taxi and grey SUV heading away from the viewer, framed by distant buildings and streetlights under a cloudy sky.

end of description

The camera subtly pans right and zooms out slightly, broadening the view to reveal more of the street on the right and extending the visible sidewalk further down on the left. The person and dog in the midground shift slightly forward and right relative to their initial positions, as the taxi and SUV on the street continue to move rightward and away from the first-frame viewpoint. New red markings on the sidewalk to the right of the dog handler are also gradually revealed as the frame expands.

In the first frame, two individuals' backs are prominent in the immediate foreground; one in a dark jacket and white cap on the right, and another in a dark jacket to the left, part of a masked line. This line of people extends left along a building featuring a brightly lit marquee that reads "INTERMISSION IS OVER," beneath an awning. To the right, a wet sidewalk stretches into the midground, bordered by a black utility pole, beyond which a yellow taxi and a dark SUV are visible on the street, with more vehicles and city buildings in the distance under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera subtly moves forward. The person in the right foreground gradually shifts out of view to the right, fully revealing the sidewalk and street scene. A small white dog appears on the sidewalk in the midground, to the right of the queuing people, and then moves further away. Concurrently, the line of people to the left becomes more fully visible as the viewpoint advances along the street.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a street scene from a ground-level perspective. To the left, a line of people waits on a sidewalk in front of a building featuring an "ESPRESSO" sign and a marquee overhead stating "INTERMISSION IS OVER." A wide street occupies the mid-ground and right, with a yellow taxi and a gray SUV visible, while distant buildings and streetlights line the background.

end of description
In subsequent frames, the yellow taxi and gray SUV on the street move forward and to the right, gradually exiting the frame from the right side. The line of people on the sidewalk to the viewer's left remains mostly stationary, while other pedestrians further down the street continue to walk away from the viewer.
