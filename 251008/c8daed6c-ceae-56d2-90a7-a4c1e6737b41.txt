The first frame displays a mountain village with a paved path, metal railing, and stone wall on the right, adjacent to trees and a white building. To the left, a grassy slope features several chalets and a white fence, extending towards snow-capped mountains and a deep valley under a blue sky. Two people are seen walking away from the viewer on the path.
end of description
The camera subtly moves forward and slightly to the left, causing the path and railing to appear to widen from the initial viewpoint. The two people on the path continue walking further into the distance, becoming smaller relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
