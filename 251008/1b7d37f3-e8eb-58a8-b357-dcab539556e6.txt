The first frame shows a multi-lane urban road stretching into the distance under a cloudy sky. To the viewer's immediate right, a light blue truck moves toward the viewer. On the left, a light pink multi-story building and a sidewalk with a red fire hydrant are visible. Bare trees line both sides of the road, leading to a blue overhead road sign in the upper center indicating directions. In the distance, several cars are visible, and more buildings line the street on both sides, with a larger grey apartment building on the far right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the light blue truck on the right moves past the viewer, exiting the frame, while a white SUV on the right lane approaches the viewer and moves forward. The viewer's perspective advances along the street, causing the overhead blue road sign to appear higher and closer, and the buildings and trees on both sides to shift relatively lower and closer. A small dark object, possibly a bird, flies from the mid-right sky towards the upper left, disappearing after a few frames, while traffic ahead of the viewer also moves forward down the street.

The first frame shows a city street looking forward, lined with bare trees, buildings, and sidewalks on both sides under an overcast sky, with a prominent overhead blue street sign on the upper left and a green traffic light on the right. Several vehicles, including a silver sedan, a yellow kei van, and a small dark utility vehicle, are visible in the midground ahead on the multi-lane road.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the blue street sign exits the top of the frame and the road ahead moves closer. Vehicles previously ahead, including the silver sedan and yellow kei van, continue to move forward and further away from the initial viewpoint. A light-colored truck appears from behind the smaller utility vehicle on the right, also moving forward. Concurrently, a red Coca-Cola vending machine and a yellow gas station sign become visible further to the left of the original viewpoint, having been obscured by the initial perspective.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a multi-lane city road with a crosswalk directly in front of the viewer, beneath a cloudy sky. To the left, a white building, bare trees, and a utility pole with a green traffic light and various road signs are visible. To the right, a light-colored truck with a yellow tarp, and a person on a mobility scooter next to it, are near the crosswalk, with multi-story buildings further down the street.
end of description.
As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward, causing the mobility scooter to exit to the right of its initial position. The truck also moves ahead and to the right, gradually moving out of the frame as the traffic light pole and signs on the left pass by to the viewer's left. The continuous forward movement reveals more vehicles and buildings further down the street.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a road scene from a driver's perspective. In the immediate foreground, white directional arrows and lane markings are visible on the asphalt road. To the left, a row of bare-branched trees and some green foliage line a sidewalk, separated by a low white barrier, with multi-story buildings visible behind them further down the street. Ahead, a traffic intersection with red lights and a blue overhead sign is visible, spanned by a pedestrian bridge. Several vehicles are present: a black van directly ahead, a silver car further in the distance, and a white pickup truck with a white van behind it to the front-right. On the far right, buildings, utility poles, and a person walking on the sidewalk are present. The sky above is overcast with some blue showing.

end of description

The black van and silver car directly ahead gradually move forward, receding into the distance relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the white pickup truck on the front-right proceeds forward and turns right, moving further away from the initial position. A new silver car emerges from the viewer's front-left, turning right across the intersection and moving towards the front-right of the original viewpoint. The white van initially behind the white truck becomes fully visible to the front-right as vehicles shift. Finally, the traffic lights at the intersection ahead transition from red to green, indicating the viewer's imminent progression.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a multi-lane road leading towards an intersection with a red and green traffic light assembly to the right of the center, and a pedestrian bridge further ahead. To the left, bare trees line the road alongside buildings, including a multi-story apartment block, while a large "Yakiniku" sign stands prominently to the right, adjacent to a partially visible dark grey van in the foreground.
end of description
The grey van swiftly departs to the right, momentarily replaced by a black car that also quickly exits the far right of the frame. The traffic lights ahead change from red to amber and then to green as the viewer's vehicle advances, revealing two white cars further ahead on the road. The perspective continuously shifts forward, causing the traffic lights and the initial Yakiniku sign to move out of the frame to the right, while a scooter appears and rapidly crosses from the right. The pedestrian bridge and a blue directional sign directly ahead become increasingly prominent as the scene progresses.
