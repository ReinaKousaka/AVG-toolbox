The first frame shows a wet, reflective street scene at night. A large, dark utility pole with yellow and black stripes dominates the right foreground, extending from the bottom to near the top of the frame. To the left of the pole is a wet, reddish-brown sidewalk, and further left, a wet, darker street with a yellow line and a drain running along it. In the midground, buildings with illuminated storefronts line both sides of the street, with a prominent pile of white garbage bags visible on the left sidewalk. Trees are spaced along both sidewalks, and distant streetlights illuminate the wet road leading to a white car far in the background.

The camera slowly pans left, pivoting around the utility pole that initially obscured the right side, causing it to shift towards the center-left of the view. This continuous movement reveals more of the wet street and the buildings along the left side, bringing additional storefronts and the entire pile of white garbage bags further into view from their initial position to the left of the first-frame's center. Objects on the far right edge of the first frame move out of view to the right, beyond the initial viewpoint. The distant car and street remain visible, shifting slightly to the left relative to the frame as the perspective expands leftward.

In the first frame, a wet, brick sidewalk extends from the foreground to the mid-ground on the right. To the left, a dark tree trunk occupies the immediate foreground, with a wet asphalt street and curb (marked by a yellow line) running alongside it. Further left and down the street, numerous white and colored trash bags are piled near shops with illuminated windows and signage; beyond this, streetlights illuminate the distant street. On the right side, commercial buildings with red awnings, wooden facades, and lit interiors line the street.

Subsequently, a person carrying a white umbrella appears on the left side of the street, walking away from the viewer. Simultaneously, another individual emerges near the piles of trash bags on the left, seemingly interacting with them. As frames progress, the person with the umbrella moves further down the street on the left and eventually disappears from view. The individual near the trash bags continues their activity on the left, and a new figure is seen walking along the far-left sidewalk, also moving away from the viewer.

The first frame displays a wet, rain-slicked city street at night, viewed down a thoroughfare lined with illuminated storefronts. In the foreground, a dark asphalt road with a yellow curb leads to a pile of garbage bags on the left sidewalk, while a reflective reddish brick pavement and a building with a red awning are on the right. A black utility pole stands on the far left, and a tree grows from the street slightly right of center, with a person in a white rain poncho walking away on the left sidewalk in the mid-ground, and a white car visible further down the street.
end of description
The person in the white rain poncho on the left sidewalk gradually moves further away from the viewer towards the background throughout the frames. The wet surfaces of the street and sidewalks remain highly reflective, with subtle shifts in light and water patterns due to ongoing rainfall. No new objects or scenes are introduced; the camera's viewpoint remains static, observing the consistent nighttime rainy street environment.
