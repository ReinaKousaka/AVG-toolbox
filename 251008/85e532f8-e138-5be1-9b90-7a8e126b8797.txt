The first frame depicts a wet city sidewalk on the left, where a man in a dark coat stands with his back to the viewer, observing a white sign on a black stand, beneath a vibrant green-leaved tree. To the right, a storefront with a black and white striped awning features a round "CAKE HAPPY" sign, and a large glass window outlined in green neon advertising "ICE CREAM," "ESPRESSO," "COLD BREW," and "CUSTOM CAKES." A dark brown hanging plant basket with green foliage is suspended from the awning, above a wooden bench; a green round table with two chairs sits further left, and red tables and chairs are positioned closer to the viewer on the far right.

The camera slowly pans right, causing the red tables and chairs to exit the frame on the right. The ice cream cone display inside the window changes color and form, transitioning from purple/pink to white/red, then a multi-colored swirl, as decorative pumpkin-like objects appear on the window ledge. Concurrently, the hanging plant swings slightly, emphasizing the subtle lateral shift of the viewpoint.
