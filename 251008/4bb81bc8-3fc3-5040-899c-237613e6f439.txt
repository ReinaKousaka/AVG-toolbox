A long building with "BANKNEWPORT" signage and large blue-tinted windows runs along the left, with a gray Fiat and several other cars parked on the street in front of it. A two-lane road with double yellow lines extends into the distance from the viewer's immediate front, flanked by a row of parked cars on the right side. In the background, more buildings and some greenery are visible under a blue sky with scattered clouds.

The viewer progressively moves forward along the street, causing the BankNewport building and parked cars on both sides to recede from the initial viewpoint. The gray Fiat on the left drives forward, revealing a white car that was parked behind it. A pedestrian emerges from the BankNewport building's entrance and walks toward the viewer's left. The distant cityscape ahead becomes slightly closer.

The first frame shows the viewer situated on a city street, looking forward. To the immediate left is a white sedan parked alongside a building with "BANKNEWPORT" signage, and a person walks on the sidewalk next to it. To the immediate right, part of a silver SUV is parked, with a tall building beyond it; the road ahead is lined with more parked cars on both sides and distant traffic, all beneath a bright blue sky with white clouds.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the street, the white car and the pedestrian on the immediate left, along with the silver SUV on the immediate right, sequentially move out of view to the sides. Concurrently, new parked cars and sections of sidewalk previously further ahead are revealed, and a new pedestrian becomes visible further along the right sidewalk.

The initial frame presents a downtown street scene from a vehicle's forward-facing perspective, featuring a two-lane road flanked by multi-story buildings on both sides. On the left, a building with large windows has parked blue and silver sedans, while on the right, another building with 'VF FITNESS' and 'XPRESSO' signs has parked dark gray and white sedans; ahead, the street leads to an intersection with traffic lights and distant vehicles under a blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint subtly moves forward, all objects along the street appear closer; a person in a yellow shirt emerges on the right sidewalk near 'XPRESSO' and moves slightly to the right, while another individual becomes visible on the left sidewalk further down near orange cones. Simultaneously, the black SUV in the middle of the road ahead slowly advances.

The first frame displays a street scene from a driver's perspective, looking forward down a two-lane road with yellow double lines. On the left, a multi-story building with "metro by T-mobile" branding on its ground floor has a blue sedan and a silver sedan parked in front of it, with orange traffic cones further ahead. On the right, another building features an "XPRESS" sign and a "7 ELEVEN" sign, with a grey sedan and a black pickup truck parked closest to the viewer, and a person in a yellow shirt standing near the "XPRESS" sign. In the distance, an intersection is visible with red traffic lights and several cars waiting, all beneath a bright blue sky with white clouds.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The blue car on the left and the grey car on the right move out of view from the bottom of the frame, revealing more of the silver car on the left and the black pickup truck on the right. The black SUV in the main lane ahead moves perceptibly closer. On the right, the "XPRESS" sign is replaced by the more prominent "7 ELEVEN" sign as the viewer passes, and the person in the yellow shirt is no longer visible.
