frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a paved road leading uphill from the viewer, flanked by steep green grassy slopes. Several people walk on the road ahead, while a large tree stands to the road's left and a person kneels on the right slope. A dense coniferous forest occupies the background behind the slopes, extending across the horizon.
**end of description**
As frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the road, causing the kneeling person on the right slope and a small white object near the road to disappear, now behind the viewer's original position. The walking figures ahead appear to draw slightly closer, indicating continuous forward motion relative to the initial viewpoint. The displayed pace and speed metrics dynamically update.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a paved path extending forward and slightly rightward, flanked by green grassy slopes. A large tree trunk and branches dominate the left foreground, partially obscuring the path ahead. In the midground, a group of people are visible further down the path, while a line of smaller trees parallels the left side. A white sign rests on the right grassy slope, and a dense forest forms the backdrop, meeting a clear blue sky. On-screen data overlays appear in the bottom right, top left, and as a white line depicting a route.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the paved path. The large tree in the left foreground shifts out of view to the left, revealing more of the path and the trees beyond its initial position. The group of people ahead, initially in the midground of the first frame, grow larger and closer, indicating the viewer is approaching their previous location on the path. Concurrently, the white sign on the right grassy slope also appears closer and moves slightly to the right of its original placement. The on-screen running metrics consistently update, reflecting the ongoing movement.
