In the first frame, a beige outdoor sofa with two patterned pillows and a red throw on its right armrest occupies the foreground, positioned directly in front of the viewer. Behind the sofa, a black metal railing extends across the midground, beyond which lush green foliage, a grassy path, and dense forest are visible in the background.

The camera slowly pans to the right, gradually revealing a wooden structure, possibly a small hut or gazebo, on a slope to the left of the frame, behind the railing and sofa. This pan also unveils more of the dense forest to the right and shows the grassy path extending deeper into the woods, relative to the initial view.
