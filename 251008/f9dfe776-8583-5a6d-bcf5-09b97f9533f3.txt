The first frame depicts a snow-covered cemetery in Grindelwald, Switzerland, under a clear blue sky, with numerous tombstones of various shapes and sizes scattered across the foreground and midground. A prominent dark, triangular tombstone is centrally located in the foreground, with a taller, slender one to its left, while a white church building with snow-covered roofs is visible to the far right. Bare deciduous trees and evergreen shrubs are interspersed among the graves, leading to distant snow-capped mountains under a contrail-streaked sky in the background.

The camera slowly pans to the left across subsequent frames, progressively revealing more of a large, rocky, snow-dusted mountain face on the far left, previously outside the first frame's view. Simultaneously, the white church building on the far right gradually moves out of the frame, and new snow-covered terrain appears on the left side as the viewpoint shifts. The central tombstones and distant village buildings remain visible but appear to shift rightward relative to the continuously panning frame.

The first frame displays a snow-covered cemetery on a sunny day, with various dark gravestones and monuments partially buried in snow across the foreground and midground. Bare trees stand on the left, while small evergreen trees and several buildings, including a prominent traditional house, are visible further back to the right, all set against a backdrop of snow-capped mountains and a clear blue sky.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly pans to the right, progressively revealing more of a light-colored building with dark-framed windows and a dark roof on the immediate right of the initial scene. This rightward movement continuously uncovers additional gravestones and snow-covered ground within the cemetery. As the scene shifts, the large mountain previously dominating the far left of the first frame gradually moves further left, expanding the visible landscape of the village to the right.
