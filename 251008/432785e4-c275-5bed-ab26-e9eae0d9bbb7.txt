In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a street looking forward, with a white pedestrian crossing directly ahead and slightly to the left. To the left, a metal barrier precedes a large multi-story apartment building with ground-floor shops, partially obscured by green trees. To the right, a blue bus is driving away from the viewer, followed by other vehicles down the street, which is also lined with trees. A clear blue sky spans above, and a circular map overlay is visible in the bottom-left corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the street, causing the pedestrian crossing to recede. The blue bus continues to move away ahead of the viewer, with other vehicles also advancing further down the road. A "no U-turn" sign emerges more clearly on the right side of the road, just past the metal barrier. The buildings and trees on both sides of the street gradually shift towards the edges of the frame as the viewpoint advances.
