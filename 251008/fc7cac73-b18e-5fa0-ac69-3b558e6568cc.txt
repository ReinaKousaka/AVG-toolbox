The first frame shows the back of a person in a dark red "HUGE" cap and black shirt, largely filling the lower-center, with a metal railing in the lower-left. Ahead, a bustling convention hall features numerous people walking, flanked by display stands on both sides showcasing colorful anime-style artworks and posters. A yellow-skirted table and a "JISU" sign are visible at a booth to the left, while the background reveals high ceilings with lights and distant white walls.

As the viewer moves forward, the surrounding crowd continually shifts, revealing new individuals like a person with white hair crossing the mid-left path. A smiling man in a blue shirt also emerges from the right side, passing by as the viewpoint steadily advances through the lively hall.

In the first frame, the viewer faces a bustling indoor event space. Immediately in the foreground to the right is the back of a person's head wearing a maroon cap and a black shirt, with a smiling person with glasses partially visible to their right. In the mid-ground, a crowd of people walks away from the viewer, with a person in a dark blue hoodie and grey hood most prominent among them. To the left, a black grid display rack is covered with numerous anime/manga-style prints, including one of Pikachu, with books visible on a table below it. Further back and slightly to the left, a "JISU" branded booth displays more artwork and has a person behind its counter.

The smiling person to the immediate right of the foreground cap-wearer slightly shifts their position and turns their head as the frames progress. Concurrently, the crowd in the mid-ground, walking away from the viewer, slowly advances forward. This movement progressively reveals more of the "JISU" booth and the woman sitting behind its counter, located further behind the initial crowd. On the far right, additional individuals, including one with pink hair, become more visible as the people directly in front of them move.
