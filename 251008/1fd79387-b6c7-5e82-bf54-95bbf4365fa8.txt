The first frame presents a rainy night city scene with a wet asphalt road on the left and a brick sidewalk on the right, both reflecting numerous illuminated building signs in the background. A dark car with its headlights on is positioned on the road to the left of the viewer, near a crosswalk, while a utility pole stands prominently on the sidewalk in the mid-ground.

As frames progress, the dark car on the left slowly drives further away down the street, receding into the mid-background. Throughout, rain continues to fall, causing dynamic shimmering reflections on the wet road and sidewalk surfaces.

The first frame shows a rainy city street at night. A large dark pole with a flared base stands in the near foreground, slightly to the left of center, positioned at the edge of a wet, brick-patterned sidewalk. To the viewer's right, a bright green vertical sign advertising a red fruit drink stands beside a building with a reflective glass facade. The wet street, reflecting various lights, occupies the left side of the frame and displays white road markings. In the midground, the sidewalk is lined with trees and additional poles extending into the distance, while illuminated buildings stretch along both sides of the street, with red traffic lights visible in the background. Rain streaks are visible throughout.

The camera slowly pans left, gradually revealing more of the street and buildings that were previously just outside the initial left edge of the frame. A dark utility box or vending machine, initially partially obscured behind and to the left of the prominent foreground pole from the first-frame viewpoint, gradually becomes fully visible. Subsequently, a black car briefly appears on the wet street in the midground, originating from the left side of the first-frame's view and moving further into the distance. Finally, a 'Rain Everyday' watermark appears in the bottom-left corner of the frame starting from the sixth frame.

The first frame captures a rainy city street at night, viewed from a sidewalk. To the immediate right stands a tall green sign featuring drink images, while on the left, a dark kiosk displaying posters and a white trash bag are beside the curb of the reflective, wet road. Trees line the sidewalk, and distant city buildings with illuminated signs, along with vehicle lights, are visible through the falling rain.

Throughout the sequence, rain visibly continues to fall, enhancing reflections on the wet street. Vehicles emerge from the mid-left, moving right across the street; a white bus is prominently seen passing by, followed by another vehicle. All static elements like buildings, trees, and foreground signs remain fixed, with only the moving vehicles and persistent rainfall indicating change.
