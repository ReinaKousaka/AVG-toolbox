The first frame presents a wet asphalt road, marked with a solid yellow line on the left and a white parking space line on the right, under a light rain. A white SUV occupies the far right of the foreground, while a row of potted evergreen trees lines a sidewalk to the mid-left, leading to a distant pedestrian with an umbrella and other vehicles. Background buildings and more trees are visible further down the road on both sides under the overcast sky.

Through the subsequent frames, the white SUV on the immediate right steadily backs away and exits the frame entirely to the right of the viewer. This movement progressively reveals the now empty parking space and the curb to the right of the initial viewpoint, as the rain persists throughout the scene.

The initial frame presents a wet asphalt road on a rainy day. In the foreground, yellow dashed lines mark the left side of the road, while a prominent white horizontal line crosses the center, leading to a grey tiled curb edged with yellow on the far right. A row of dark-potted, spherical green bushes lines the left side of the road, extending into the midground, with larger trees and a white van partially visible behind them. On the right, dense green bushes and trees flank the road, behind which a building or barrier with black and yellow striped markings stands. A white car is parked on the right side of the road in the midground, facing away, with more trees and distant buildings under an overcast sky in the background.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the scene remains spatially static relative to the initial viewpoint. The sole dynamic change is the continuous presence of light rain, visible as subtle streaks falling across the entire scene. This rainfall consistently keeps the asphalt wet, enhancing reflections and surface ripples without altering any object's position or revealing new elements.

The first frame displays a wet asphalt road extending from the viewer into the distance, marked by a white crosswalk line in the foreground and yellow dashed lines on the left, with a yellow-lined curb on the far right leading to a sidewalk. A silver car is parked in the midground, slightly right of center, while manicured potted shrubs line the left sidewalk and dense green foliage borders a building on the right, all under an overcast, rainy sky with distant buildings visible.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, the rain persists and a person holding a white umbrella emerges from behind the parked silver car in the midground, progressing slowly towards the viewer on the left sidewalk.
