The first frame displays a street scene looking forward down an asphalt road, bordered by multi-story buildings featuring shops on the ground floor; buildings on the left have red awnings and display flags, while those on the right have striped awnings and are partially obscured by a tree trunk and a metal railing in the immediate foreground. Numerous pedestrians occupy both sidewalks, and a white car is visible on the road in the middle distance under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the white car approaches from the distant road, passing the viewer and eventually occupying the left foreground before moving out of frame. Concurrently, several pedestrians on the right sidewalk walk towards and past the viewer, becoming prominent in the right foreground before receding from view. The tree trunk and metal railing initially in the right foreground move out of frame as the camera advances, revealing more of the shops on the right side of the street.
