The first frame depicts an urban street scene featuring a white car moving leftward in the mid-ground and a person on a scooter moving rightward in the right foreground. To the left, palm trees and apartment buildings are visible, while to the right, a large grey archway, adorned with a lamp post and manicured bush, serves as an entrance to another area, with more buildings behind it.

The white car and scooter then move out of frame as the viewpoint pans right. This transition reveals a long street extending forward into the distance from the initial perspective, lined with buildings and traffic lights. Further to the right of the original archway, traditional-style buildings with red lanterns and a person on a cargo scooter in the immediate foreground become visible.

The viewer is positioned facing down a city street at what appears to be dusk or dawn, indicated by the pale yellowish sky. In the foreground, a paved road extends into the distance. To the immediate right, a person on a three-wheeled cargo bike, facing away from the viewer, is loaded with white crates; beside them is a traditional-style building with an ornate roof and reddish elements. To the left, a person on a scooter, also facing away, is seen, with a traditional building entrance adorned with red lanterns and scaffolding further to the left. In the midground, an intersection hosts several vehicles, including scooters and cars, and two overhead traffic lights display red. Beyond this, the street is bordered by numerous multi-story buildings, receding into the background, with overhead wires and poles visible at the top of the frame.

The scooter on the left in the foreground moves forward and slightly left, passing the scaffolding structure. Simultaneously, vehicles at the intersection in the mid-ground, including a white car and multiple scooters, begin to proceed forward, moving away from the viewer and across the intersection. Another scooter, initially to the right and slightly behind the first, also advances into the intersection. The three-wheeled cargo bike on the right remains stationary relative to the viewer throughout the sequence.
