The first frame depicts a sunny, clear day on an upward-sloping, slightly curving asphalt road with a prominent yellow centerline. To the left of the viewer, red and white plastic barriers line the roadside, beyond which a grassy slope rises to a large, multi-story wooden chalet and a smaller house further up the hillside. To the right, two wooden-clad recycling bins with dark lids are positioned beside the road, flanked by dense green trees and foliage, while the background reveals distant mountains under a blue sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The red and white barriers on the left foreground and the recycling bins on the right foreground recede and eventually move out of frame, revealing more of the road ahead and a third bin on the right. The shadows on the road shift slightly, and a person on a bicycle becomes visible in the distance, further up the road, moving towards the viewer.
