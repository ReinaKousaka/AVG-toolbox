The first frame captures a rainy city street with a person in a plaid coat walking away from the viewer in the foreground, holding a clear umbrella with a red rim. To their left, a wet multi-lane road, separated by a metal barrier, shows cars moving, while a dense array of multi-story buildings with colorful signs and distant skyscrapers defines the background under an overcast sky.

As the viewpoint moves forward, the person with the umbrella continues walking, gradually revealing more of the wet sidewalk and the building facade on the right. Concurrently, vehicles like a white car and a black truck on the road to the left exit and enter the scene, dynamically shifting positions relative to the initial frame's center. The overall urban landscape remains consistent but is viewed from a progressively closer vantage point.

The first frame presents a person in the immediate foreground, viewed from behind, holding a clear umbrella with a red rim, walking on a wet city sidewalk. To the viewer's left, a rain-slicked street is separated by barriers, showing several cars, including a black sedan and an SUV, in motion, while towering buildings with vibrant signs line both sides of the street in the midground and background, under an overcast sky.

Subsequently, the black car on the street moves further left out of frame, followed by a black SUV continuing leftward from the mid-left. A blue-covered truck then appears from the right midground, passing the traffic light as it moves left, followed by a white van also entering from the right and proceeding left past the traffic light, while the foreground person remains largely stationary.

In the foreground, a person walks away from the viewer on a wet city sidewalk, holding a clear umbrella with a red trim, wearing a patterned coat. To the viewer's left, a metal barrier separates the sidewalk from a wet, multi-lane road reflecting the urban lights and buildings. On this road, a white van is moving quickly forward, with a blue-tarped truck visible behind it, both traveling away from the viewer. Tall buildings, adorned with numerous illuminated signs and advertisements, line both sides of the street extending into the background, where a green traffic light is visible. In the midground, other pedestrians with umbrellas are sparsely distributed along the sidewalk to the right.
end of description
The person with the clear and red umbrella in the foreground steadily walks further away from the viewer, advancing down the street. Concurrently, the white van on the road to the viewer's left swiftly moves forward and exits the frame to the left. Subsequently, the blue-tarped truck and a black sedan also proceed forward along the street, moving away from the viewer. As these vehicles advance, new black cars emerge from behind them and follow suit. Other pedestrians in the midground continue to move along the sidewalk further down the street.
