To the viewer's left, a large orange building with numerous windows occupies the foreground and midground. In the far background, jagged, snow-capped mountains rise under a clear blue sky, visible above a winding road that extends into the midground, flanked by a smaller white house behind the orange one, and other buildings further along the street. A red and white flag, likely Swiss, flies from a pole positioned in the immediate right foreground.

The camera steadily moves forward, causing the orange building on the left to enlarge within the frame and revealing more of the paved street ahead. Concurrently, the red and white flag in the right foreground progressively moves out of view to the right, while the majestic snow-capped mountains in the background slowly become more central in the frame.
