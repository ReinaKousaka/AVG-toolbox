First, a green bush occupies the foreground left, opposite a white column and a glass-encased, brightly lit Christmas tree on the foreground right. The midground depicts a wet urban street at night, reflecting city lights and showcasing various vehicles—including a yellow pedicab, taxis, dark SUVs, and a steaming blue bus further back—set against tall, illuminated buildings, with a cyclist and pedestrians visible on the pavement.

The pedicab on the far left gradually moves forward, revealing more of a yellow taxi previously behind it. Concurrently, a cyclist crosses the midground from right to left, followed by several pedestrians traversing the street behind the cyclist. Traffic in the mid-ground also subtly shifts, with some vehicles advancing.
