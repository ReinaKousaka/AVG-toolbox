The first frame depicts a river scene with multiple vessels. In the midground, three people on blue paddleboards are in the left half of the river, while two punts, filled with passengers and propelled by a punter, are in the right half. The left bank features a brick wall with a moored wooden punt, and behind it, a historic building and a yellow construction crane. The right bank is lined with trees, and a green bridge spans the river in the background.

Over the subsequent frames, the paddleboarders actively paddle, moving slightly forward and left within the river. The punter in the closer boat repeatedly raises and lowers their pole, steadily pushing the punt and its passengers forward and right, while the second punt also slowly advances.
