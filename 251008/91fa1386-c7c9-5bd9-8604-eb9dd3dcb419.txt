The first frame depicts a city sidewalk scene with pedestrians and buildings, featuring green plants and a 'TOBU HOTEL' sign on the left, and a street with vehicles on the right. A woman in a grey hoodie with headphones is in the mid-right, partly obscured by a reddish-brown pillar, while another person's back is visible in the foreground right.
end of description
Following frames show the grey-hoodie woman moving out of frame to the right, revealing a woman in a dark top and light pants on the mid-right sidewalk. Subsequently, a woman in a white dress emerges from behind the central pillar on the right, moving towards a green illuminated sign, as other pedestrians continue their movement on the left sidewalk.

The first frame shows a city street scene with pedestrians on a sidewalk to the left, including a woman with a white tote bag, a man, and a boy, near a building signed 'TOBU HOTEL'. To the right, a woman in a grey top walks past a street pole, with a road featuring cars and distant buildings visible across the street.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the woman and person behind her on the right move completely out of frame to the right, revealing more of the sidewalk and a white sign. On the left, the woman with the white tote bag raises her arm, pointing forward, and a new woman behind her becomes fully visible, while a white truck emerges further down the street on the right, driving away.

In the first frame, a young boy in a blue shirt and an adult male in a dark shirt are partially visible in the left foreground, walking past the viewer. To their right, two light-colored utility boxes stand on the sidewalk. Further along the sidewalk to the left, buildings with illuminated storefronts and a prominent "TOBU HOTEL" sign are visible, with green foliage below the sign. To the right of the utility boxes, separated by a railing, a street with multiple cars (including a white SUV and black sedans) extends into the distance, paralleled by a tall building on the far right. The background features more distant buildings under an overcast sky.
end of description
The boy and man move past the viewer to the left and exit the frame. The camera viewpoint progresses forward along the sidewalk, causing the two utility boxes to shift from the midground to the foreground, eventually moving off-frame to the viewer's right. Simultaneously, the "TOBU HOTEL" sign and the buildings on the left side of the sidewalk appear to move closer to the viewer, while the cars and buildings on the right side of the street recede further into the distance relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
On the immediate right, two light green utility boxes are partially visible, with the closest one significantly cropped. To the left, a patch of green bushes sits below a building that includes a "TORII HOTEL" sign and illuminated storefronts, notably one for "カラオケ" (Karaoke). A sidewalk extends into the distance, populated by several pedestrians, running parallel to a multi-lane road on the right where a black car is partially seen behind the utility boxes. Across the road, a large building with arched windows and a "KIMURAYA" sign is prominent, with other buildings and an overcast sky in the background.
end of description
The utility boxes on the immediate right progressively recede from the viewpoint, revealing more of the multi-lane road. A silver SUV enters the frame from the right side of the road, moving left, eventually passing where the utility boxes were located. A white sedan subsequently appears behind the SUV, also moving left across the road. The camera slightly shifts, revealing more of the sidewalk and storefronts to the left, as the utility boxes completely exit the frame to the viewer's right.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The initial frame showcases a city street, featuring a building on the immediate left with an illuminated 'カラオケ' sign and a fire hydrant, alongside a sidewalk receding into the distance where pedestrians are visible. To the right, a multi-lane road with cars moves parallel to a black fence, with a large building displaying 'KIMISE' signs further down on the far right.
end of description
Subsequently, the two main pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue walking further away from the viewer, while the white and silver cars on the road also proceed in the same direction. As the scene progresses, additional red signs become visible along the left building, with one revealing 'KARAOKE STUDIO' further down the sidewalk from the viewer's initial position. Finally, a bicycle wheel and part of its frame emerge into view at the bottom right edge of the frame, positioned to the right of the existing fence.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a city sidewalk scene, with a Karaoke Big Echo storefront featuring posters and an A-frame sign to the viewer's left. A black metal railing on the right separates the sidewalk from a street where a white car moves away and a yellow bicycle is partially visible in the lower right. Two pedestrians, a man with a bag and a woman with a cane, walk towards the viewer on the mid-ground sidewalk, with a large building across the street on the right.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the man and woman continue walking past the viewer on the sidewalk to their left. The white car on the street moves further away to the right, and the yellow bicycle to the right becomes more fully visible as another person on a bicycle appears behind it, moving right. Other pedestrians on the distant sidewalk also shift positions.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The viewer is on a city sidewalk looking forward down a street. To the immediate left is a brightly lit storefront with large glass windows and red "BIG ECHO" signage, with an A-frame sign at the bottom left. An older woman with a cane walks towards the viewer on the right sidewalk, alongside a black railing separating it from a street where a white car and a person on a bicycle are visible. Buildings line both sides of the street in the distance under an overcast sky.
end of description
The older woman with the cane moves towards the bottom right, eventually exiting the frame from the right. Concurrently, the A-frame sign on the left recedes and shifts left, gradually revealing a "KARAOKE" sign and an elevator entrance on the storefront. Posters displayed inside the storefront windows also change. A person appears to enter and sit inside the white car on the right street, which remains largely stationary.
