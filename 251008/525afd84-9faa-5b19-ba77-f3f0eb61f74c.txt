The first frame shows a construction site with a large, modern building featuring a curved wooden slatted facade on the upper right, and a dark, glass-windowed lower section. A yellow CAT mini excavator is centrally located with its arm extended into a foreground excavation, while another construction vehicle and a row of residential buildings are visible further left, with city high-rises in the distant background under a clear blue sky. Yellow safety barriers and blue pipes are present in the immediate foreground.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the mini excavator's arm dynamically lifts, pivots slightly to the right, and then lowers into another part of the excavated area. Simultaneously, a small wheeled cart emerges from the right and moves left across the lower level of the main building, behind the foreground fence.
