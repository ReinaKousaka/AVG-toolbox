In the first frame, two partially visible recycling bins are in the immediate foreground to the left. A bus stop shelter with two illuminated advertising posters stands prominently in the midground-left, beside a wide street with visible lane markings. To the right, a large building features an illuminated marquee advertising "THE FULL MONTY" above a storefront with "Bravo Java" signage and display windows. A wide, illuminated sidewalk stretches into the background, where multiple pedestrians are walking away from the viewer; overhead, decorative string lights span the street.
end of description
Multiple pedestrians are observed moving along the midground sidewalk, receding further into the distance relative to the viewer's initial position. A person in a dark jacket on the right side of the sidewalk progresses steadily away from the viewer down the street. Two other individuals, positioned further ahead on the sidewalk, also continue walking forward, gradually diminishing in size as they move further from the first-frame viewpoint.

On the far left, a large illuminated poster display features a red 'MADRID' sign above an 'ABBA' movie poster, with graffiti visible on the structure above them. Further along the left sidewalk, a covered bus stop structure also displays illuminated posters, with several pedestrians visible near it. The center shows a wide, illuminated sidewalk receding into the distance where more pedestrians are walking away from the viewer. To the right, a large theater marquee brightly advertises "THE FULL MONTY" above a closed entrance, and a blue "EL MAGO POP" poster stands further right, next to another building displaying "Bravo".
end of description
The most prominent dynamic change occurs on the left side, where the illumination color progressively shifts from a bright white/yellow glow on the 'ABBA' movie poster and the canopy above it. This light gradually transitions to a distinct magenta/purple hue across subsequent frames, bathing the entire left-side foreground in purple light by the end. Simultaneously, the pedestrians in the mid-ground continue walking away from the viewer down the sidewalk.

The first frame displays a night street scene viewed from a sidewalk. In the left foreground, several illuminated advertising posters are visible under an overhang. Further along the left sidewalk, a bus stop shelter with a few people stands, behind which a road with a single car extends into the distance. On the right, a building features a large, brightly lit marquee for "MONTY" and a blue banner for "EL MAGO POP"; its ground floor is covered by metallic roller shutters. Several pedestrians walk away from the viewer down the central sidewalk, which leads into the distant city lights and buildings.
end of description
Pedestrians initially in the mid-ground continue walking away from the viewer further down the distant sidewalk. A person seated at the bus stop to the left stands up and also walks away towards the distant left. Concurrently, a car on the road to the left of the bus stop slowly progresses forward away from the viewer.

The first frame presents a night scene looking down a city street. A broad pavement with light and dark grey sections extends from the viewer's immediate foreground into the distance. To the left, a bus stop shelter is positioned, with a man and child standing closest to the viewer on the sidewalk. Beyond the bus stop, a multi-lane road stretches into the distance, showing faint car lights on the far left. To the right, a building with a brightly lit marquee and roller-shuttered ground-floor shops runs parallel to the pavement, with several people walking away from the viewer along this sidewalk. The background reveals towering city buildings lining both sides of the street, illuminated by numerous lights under a dark sky.
end of description
A scooter appears on the far left of the road, moving rightward past the bus stop. Subsequently, a white taxi cab emerges further down the road, also traveling rightward. Throughout the frames, pedestrians on the right sidewalk continue walking away from the viewer into the distance, and other distant vehicles on the road slowly progress.

The first frame presents a night-time street scene, with the viewer looking down a busy city road. On the left foreground, a man and a small child stand on a sidewalk next to a bus stop, with a multi-lane road and distant buildings, including a hotel, stretching behind them. To the right, a building with an illuminated theater marquee and storefronts borders a wide sidewalk where several people walk away from the viewer. end of description. In the subsequent frames, the man and child on the left remain largely in place but show subtle movements. Simultaneously, the white car on the road and the pedestrians on the right sidewalk continue to move further down the street, receding into the distance relative to the static first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a night-time street scene with illuminated buildings and a busy sidewalk. To the immediate left, a man in a blue jacket stands beside a small child next to a bus stop shelter adorned with glowing advertisements. Beyond the bus stop, a road stretches into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings, including one labeled "HOTEL EMPERADOR," and streetlights. On the right, a wide paved sidewalk features graffiti on a building wall, with a person on a scooter and several pedestrians moving away from the viewer into the mid-distance, where more illuminated buildings line the street.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the man and child on the left subtly shift their stances, with the child moving slightly further from the man. Concurrently, the person on the scooter in the midground right continues to travel further down the sidewalk, receding from the viewer's perspective. Similarly, other pedestrians visible in the mid-distance progressively move deeper into the scene, advancing away from the initial viewpoint. The static elements of the street, bus shelters, and buildings remain unchanged.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a night street scene looking down a city thoroughfare. To the immediate left is a glass bus stop shelter with illuminated advertisements, where a person in a plaid shirt is partially visible inside. Further down the left, multi-story buildings, including one with a "HOTEL EMPERA" sign, line the street alongside more bus stops and streetlights. On the right, a wide paved sidewalk features a building with storefronts, some closed with graffiti-covered shutters, and one open shop displaying a "YOUR LOCAL EXPERT" sign. A person in a dark jacket is walking away from the viewer on the right sidewalk, while a larger group of people also moves away in the center-midground, all receding towards the distant city lights and a tall building under a dark sky.
end of description
The viewer's perspective remains fixed as the scene unfolds. The person on the right sidewalk continues to walk further away from the viewer, gradually receding into the distance. Concurrently, the group of people in the mid-ground also proceeds down the street, becoming progressively smaller as they move further from the first-frame viewpoint. Subtle changes occur in the bus stop advertisements on the left, with a new "CHUCKY" movie poster appearing from frame 7 onwards.
