The first frame captures a rainy city night from the viewpoint of a wet, reflective street, revealing tall illuminated buildings in the background and a bright yellow street lamp on the right midground, which illuminates visible rainfall. Colorful city lights, including a green traffic signal far left and vehicle light trails, reflect across the road, extending into the distance away from the viewer.

As subsequent frames progress, the visible rainfall appears to intensify while two figures with umbrellas emerge in the central midground and slowly walk further away from the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, vehicle light trails continuously appear and recede on the left side of the road, also moving away into the distance.

A rainy city night scene unfolds with a glistening, reflective street surface extending from the foreground into the midground, reflecting numerous colorful lights from tall buildings on the left and a bright yellow streetlight on the far right. Several dark figures holding umbrellas are visible in the midground center-left, with vehicle light trails further left, while distant illuminated buildings and signs punctuate the background against a dark sky.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the primary dynamic change is the continuous rainfall visible as constant streaking across the entire view. The shimmering reflections of the city lights on the wet street subtly undulate, indicating minor water movement from the rain. All other objects, including the distant buildings and streetlights, remain spatially static relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a rainy city night scene. In the foreground, a wet, reflective asphalt road fills the bottom half of the frame, showing shimmering reflections of lights. To the left, a multi-lane road extends into the distance, with blurred light trails from vehicles moving towards the viewer, and several figures with umbrellas are walking on an adjacent sidewalk. In the midground-right, a bright yellow street lamp glows intensely, illuminating the wet surroundings, while beyond it, foliage lines the road. In the background, tall city buildings with numerous illuminated windows and signs rise against a dark sky, primarily to the left, with more distant lights visible towards the center-right.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, rain continues to fall visibly across the entire scene. Vehicles on the road to the left continue to move, extending and shifting their light trails as they approach the viewer. The pedestrians with umbrellas near the left edge also show subtle movement, progressing along the sidewalk relative to their initial positions. The reflections on the wet road surface subtly shimmer and change due to the ongoing rainfall and the movement of the lights.
