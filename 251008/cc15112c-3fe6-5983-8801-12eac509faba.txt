The first frame captures a wide shot of a large, brightly lit convention hall with a dark ceiling, numerous overhead lights, and light brown/grey walls with horizontal accents. In the immediate foreground, to the left, the back of a person in a plaid shirt is visible, surrounded by several empty brown folding chairs; to their right, another person is seated, facing away, wearing a blue hoodie. The midground is bustling with many people, some in costumes, standing and walking, with a pink booth visible on the far left. Further back and to the right, numerous tables are arranged in a curved formation, each equipped with computer monitors and chairs, with attendees actively engaged. The background reveals the vastness of the hall, featuring a large grey pillar to the left-center, and more attendees and gaming stations extending into the distance.

Across the subsequent frames, the camera slowly pans slightly to the left, revealing more of the hall's left side. Many individuals in the midground are actively moving, with a person in a white dress and straw hat walking from the mid-left towards the center-right. A large pink 'T-Mobile' banner, previously partially obscured behind the left-midground crowd, becomes clearly visible. The overall crowd density and activity remain consistent, with individuals in the foreground and midground shifting positions relative to the initial viewpoint.
