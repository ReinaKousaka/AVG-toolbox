The first frame displays a lively city sidewalk scene on a sunny day. In the immediate foreground, a person in a black hoodie and a prominent yellow and black backpack walks away from the viewer, positioned centrally. To the viewer's left, several pedestrians are visible, with a woman in grey holding a long box and a man next to her carrying a large white object. To the right, a man in a white vest stands near an orange traffic cone, engrossed in his phone. The background features a large, light-colored stone building on the left, and a city street with vehicles, traffic lights, and additional buildings extending into the distance on the right, all under a bright blue sky.
end of description
The person with the yellow backpack continues walking further away from the viewer and diagonally to the right, deeper into the street. Concurrently, the man in the white vest, originally to the right, progresses slightly closer to the viewer and shifts left. The woman carrying the long box on the far left also continues moving further left and slightly away from the viewer, as all pedestrians demonstrate ongoing movement along the sidewalk.
