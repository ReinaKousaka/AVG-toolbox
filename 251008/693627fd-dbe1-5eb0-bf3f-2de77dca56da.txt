frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame shows an elevated multi-lane highway under a clear blue sky. Ahead, cars are visible in both the viewer's lane and the adjacent left lane, with a green highway sign displaying '6' positioned further down the road, slightly left of center. To the viewer's immediate right, a white car travels parallel in an adjacent lane, while a concrete barrier runs along the left and a guardrail along the right. Beyond these barriers, a dense cityscape with various buildings extends into the distance on both sides.
end of description
As the viewer's vehicle moves forward, the white car to the right gradually falls behind and to the right of the viewer's original first-frame position. The green highway sign to the left approaches, revealing Japanese kanji characters "向島" above the '6' as the viewer passes it. Simultaneously, the buildings, streetlights, and other infrastructure on both sides of the highway recede chronologically into the background relative to the viewer's forward motion.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows an elevated multi-lane highway extending forward, curving slightly left, with several cars visible ahead. To the left is a concrete barrier overlooking a city skyline, while to the right, another barrier runs alongside a tall white building with visible fire escapes.
end of description
As frames progress, the viewer's vehicle moves forward, causing the distant city and buildings to the left and right to continuously shift to the viewer's rear. A silver SUV, initially partially visible on the far right, moves further into the frame and advances past the viewer's first-frame position. The cars ahead continue to move forward, generally maintaining their relative positions as the overall scene progresses.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows an elevated multi-lane road extending forward, with a silver SUV ahead and other vehicles in the distance. To the immediate left, a concrete barrier runs along the road, topped by a metal fence partially obscuring a distant cityscape. On the right, tall, modern buildings line the roadway under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the silver SUV and preceding vehicles advance further into the distance. The metal fence on the left slowly recedes and eventually disappears, revealing a wide river with multiple bridges and more of the distant city landscape to the left of the initial position. Simultaneously, the buildings on the right pass by, exposing new sections of their facades.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows the viewer traveling forward on a multi-lane highway. To the immediate left, a concrete barrier separates the road from a wide river with a distant cityscape and several bridges beyond it. On the right, a tall, light-grey building with numerous windows runs parallel to the road, partially obscured by a guardrail in the foreground, with several cars visible ahead on the road.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the highway, river, and buildings on the left recede into the background. The tall building on the right also moves backward and to the right, revealing more of its lower structure. Notably, a distinct, slender tower emerges from behind the right-hand building, becoming fully visible in the mid-distance to the right of the highway and extending high into the sky.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a vehicle is on a multi-lane road extending into the distance; a gray concrete barrier runs along the left, bordering a wide river with several bridges in the far left background. To the right, a tall building with an external stairwell dominates the midground, with a street lamp pole in front of it and a glass-facade building further behind, while the distant cityscape and a tower are visible on the horizon under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the road. As the scene progresses, the concrete barrier on the left and the tall building with external stairs on the right move out of frame to the left. A street lamp pole on the right passes by, and a white truck becomes visible further ahead on the right side of the road. The cars in front remain generally in position relative to each other as the viewpoint approaches them, while the distant cityscape and river subtly shift left.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A multi-lane road stretches directly ahead, bordered by a concrete barrier on the left separating it from a river, and a large glass-fronted building on the right. In the distance to the left, a cityscape with a bridge is visible under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, vehicles, including a white truck and a blue car, move from behind the viewer and proceed forward in the right lane. Simultaneously, a tall transparent barrier structure gradually emerges and extends along the left side of the road, increasingly obscuring the river and distant cityscape relative to the initial frame's perspective.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows the viewer on a multi-lane highway under a clear blue sky, looking forward. To the left, a concrete barrier topped by a transparent fence runs alongside a body of water with distant city buildings. To the right, a dark blue car occupies the lower corner, with a metal guardrail and a large modern building featuring numerous windows behind it, and other vehicles are visible further down the road ahead.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the highway, causing the fence, buildings, and distant road elements to recede relative to the viewer. The dark blue car on the right side also moves forward, gradually revealing its entire rear, including its license plate, as it proceeds down the road.
