In the first frame, the viewer looks down a curved asphalt road with a black SUV parked to the left, partially obscuring a white SUV behind it. A traditional brown wooden house with white trim stands further up the road on the left, while a modern multi-story building with wooden balconies and visible construction features occupies the right side, partially covered by lush green foliage. A streetlamp rises between the two buildings, slightly right of the road's center, all set against a backdrop of distant green mountains and a cloudy sky.

As the viewpoint moves forward and slightly to the right, the black SUV gradually exits the frame on the left, bringing the white SUV further into view. Simultaneously, the modern building on the right becomes more fully revealed, showcasing additional construction elements on its lower levels. A large green construction skip or dumpster newly appears to the right of the streetlamp, below the modern building, expanding into the frame from the right. Concurrently, the distant mountains on the far left become more prominent.
