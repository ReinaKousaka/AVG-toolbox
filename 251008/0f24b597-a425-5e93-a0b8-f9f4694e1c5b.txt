The first frame presents a street view from a corner, with a person carrying bags walking rightward across a crosswalk in the foreground. A blue car is parked on cobblestones to the right, while the street ahead is lined with buildings, trees, and other pedestrians on the left sidewalk, leading to a modern glass building in the background.

Throughout subsequent frames, the individual on the crosswalk steadily moves further right, away from the initial position. Concurrently, other pedestrians on the far left sidewalk also advance, and a black SUV in the mid-ground subtly moves forward on the street, all within the established first-frame viewpoint.
