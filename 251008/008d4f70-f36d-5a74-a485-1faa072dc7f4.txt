The first frame shows a wet city street on an overcast day. In the foreground, the asphalt road displays white and yellow lane markings. To the mid-left, a group of pedestrians with umbrellas are at a crosswalk, near a traffic light pole, backed by a sloped park with bare trees. A light-colored SUV is stationary in the distant lane, reflecting its lights on the wet road, positioned front-center from the viewer. To the mid-right, a sidewalk features a colorful street art installation, storefronts, and more pedestrians with umbrellas; bare trees line this side of the street. Tall buildings are visible in the background, primarily through the trees.

After the initial frames, a dark blue car appears behind the stationary SUV in the distant lane. Both vehicles then begin to move forward and slightly to the right, gradually receding from the viewer's first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the pedestrians on the far-left crosswalk continue to advance towards the center-left.

The first frame depicts a wet city street under an overcast sky, featuring an asphalt road with white crosswalk lines in the foreground. Pedestrians holding umbrellas are seen crossing from the left, while two cars are stopped mid-road, facing away from the viewer. To the right, a sidewalk with a distinctive blue patterned pillar and more pedestrians extends, backed by bare trees and city buildings.
end of description
Over subsequent frames, the pedestrian crossing from the left continues their movement further across the road, passing the blue car. Simultaneously, the person on the right sidewalk holding a black umbrella progresses forward, stepping onto the crosswalk and moving towards the viewer. The blue car also advances slightly forward from its initial stopped position.

The first frame shows a wet city street on an overcast day. In the foreground, white crosswalk lines mark the street, where two pedestrians walk from left to right; the one closer to the viewer carries a light blue bag, and the one further back holds a blue umbrella. To the right, a woman walks on the sidewalk towards the viewer, holding a black umbrella and a white cup, next to a blue utility box with Indigenous-style artwork. A blue pickup truck is visible in the midground, stopped or moving slowly in the street, with its headlights on, while a pedestrian signal with a white walking figure is mounted on a pole nearby. Bare trees line the street on the left, leading to a park-like area, with city buildings visible in the distance.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the woman on the right sidewalk walks further forward, passing the blue art box and lowering her umbrella as a "MAC" storefront becomes more visible behind her. Concurrently, the pedestrian with the light blue bag continues to cross the street from left to right. The pedestrian signal on the central pole changes from a white walking figure to a red 'Don't Walk' hand, displaying a countdown timer that begins at '9'. By the final frame, the woman on the right has moved mostly out of sight towards the bottom right, and the pedestrian with the bag has nearly reached the right sidewalk.

In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a wet city sidewalk. To the immediate right, a dark pole with graffiti is visible. Further to the right, a multi-story building houses a MAC cosmetics store with illuminated displays. Directly ahead, slightly to the left, stands a traffic light pole with a pedestrian signal displaying the number '9' and a white hand icon. On the wet street to the left of this pole, a blue pickup truck is stationary. A person carrying a white shopping bag is walking away from the viewer on the sidewalk, past the traffic light pole. To the far left, another person holding a blue umbrella is walking towards the viewer on a crosswalk. In the background, bare trees line a park-like area on the left, and tall buildings rise on the right.
end of description
The pedestrian signal's countdown decreases from 9 to 7, displaying a flashing, then solid, 'hand' icon. Simultaneously, the person with the white shopping bag continues walking away from the viewer on the sidewalk. On the left, the person with the blue umbrella, accompanied by another individual, walks closer to the viewer across the crosswalk.

In the first frame, a person holding a blue umbrella is positioned on the left, partially obscuring another person in a beige coat walking beside them on a wet sidewalk. To their right, a bright blue pickup truck is visible on the street, next to a black pole with a pedestrian signal displaying '7'. Further to the right, a person in a white beanie and dark coat walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk, towards a brightly lit MAC cosmetics store with large display windows on the far right. Bare trees line the street in the midground, with tall buildings visible in the background under an overcast sky.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the two people under the blue umbrella, to the left of the viewer, move forward and to the left, gradually revealing more of the person in the beige coat. Simultaneously, the blue pickup truck moves forward on the street, passing the black pole, while the pedestrian in the white beanie continues walking further away on the sidewalk. A new person in a dark puffer jacket becomes visible next to the person in the beige coat, under the umbrella.

The first frame shows two individuals walking away from the viewer under a blue umbrella on a wet city sidewalk, positioned to the right of a dark tree trunk and a blue pickup truck parked on the left. To their right is a MAC cosmetics store with illuminated displays, and in the background, bare trees and distant buildings are visible.
end of description
Subsequently, the two individuals continue walking further away along the sidewalk, gradually shifting more to the right from the first-frame viewpoint. A silver SUV emerges from behind the blue pickup truck on the left side of the street and proceeds to drive past it, continuing away from the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, two people sharing a blue umbrella walk away from the viewer on a wet sidewalk, with a MAC store displaying products immediately to their right. To the left, a blue pickup truck is parked beside the sidewalk, with a wet street beyond it where several cars are stopped in traffic. Bare-branched trees line the street, extending towards distant buildings under an overcast sky.
end of description
Following frames show the two umbrella-holders, the blue pickup truck, and the cars on the street all slowly moving forward away from the original viewpoint, revealing more of the MAC store facade to the right. As they advance, additional sidewalk and street details emerge ahead of their initial positions, while the distant background remains largely unchanged.
