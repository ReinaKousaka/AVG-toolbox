In the first frame, a nighttime scene displays a paved pathway on the left with embedded linear lights and illuminated plants, behind which stand several slender trees, all to the left of the viewer. To the viewer's right and center, a wider, darker paved surface stretches into the distance, also featuring a parallel embedded light line on its left edge. In the far distance, a brightly lit, ornate golden building or archway is visible, beyond which lies a city with numerous glowing lights.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances forward, the illuminated trees and linear lights on the left move closer and eventually out of the bottom-left of the frame. The wet paved surface in the center-right passes under the viewer, revealing more of its reflective sheen. In the mid-distance, approximately two people carrying umbrellas emerge and slowly approach the original first-frame viewpoint along the wider paved area. The large golden building and the city lights, initially in the far background, progressively appear slightly closer and more detailed as the camera moves.
