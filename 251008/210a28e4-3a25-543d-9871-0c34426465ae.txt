The first frame shows a wet paved sidewalk extending into the distance on the left and center, bordered by a long brick wall with green fencing on the left and dense green trees overhead. To the right, a raised planter bed with shrubs separates the sidewalk from a rainy road where vehicles, including a red car, white cars, and a green bus, are visible moving away from the viewer. Rain visibly falls across the scene, creating splashes on the glistening surfaces.

Vehicles on the road to the right of the viewer continuously move forward, receding into the distance. A traffic light, initially partially obscured by foliage on the right, intermittently illuminates green. A red car and a white car in the mid-distance on the right move away, while a black SUV subsequently enters the scene from the closer mid-distance on the right and also proceeds into the distance. Further back on the right, additional vehicles like a white car and a white car with a green stripe appear and move along the road. The visible rain consistently creates subtle splashes and ripples on the wet ground throughout the frames.

The first frame displays a wet, rainy outdoor scene. A paved path with a white dividing line extends from the viewer directly forward into the blurry distance. To the viewer's left, a low brick wall topped with green panels runs alongside the path, backed by dense, tall trees. To the viewer's right, a narrow strip of green bushes borders a wet road, where several trees line the pavement and vehicles, including a white car and a darker vehicle, are visible in the mid-ground. A triangular traffic sign is also present on the right, further away.

As the frames progress, the heavy rain continues, and a piece of white litter on the path to the viewer's left subtly shifts. Vehicles on the road to the viewer's right move forward, revealing a green and white bus emerging from the mid-ground right and receding into the distance. A traffic light, located in the distance on the right, also changes to green.
