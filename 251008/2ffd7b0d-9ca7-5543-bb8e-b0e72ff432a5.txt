The first frame shows the viewer at the entrance of a covered pedestrian shopping street, which recedes into the distance under an arched, transparent roof. In the foreground, a woman in a light green cardigan and a man in a grey t-shirt walk towards the viewer on the right, while further left, a man in blue and a woman in yellow walk away from the viewer; shops with closed shutters line both sides, decorated with lanterns and banners.

As the viewpoint advances, the woman and man initially walking towards the viewer gradually move out of frame to the right, revealing more of the street. Concurrently, the man in blue and woman in yellow move further into the mid-ground as the camera follows them. A cyclist, initially in the mid-ground on the right, approaches the viewer, coming closer into the foreground by the final frame.

The first frame captures a long, covered shopping arcade stretching into the distance under an arched skylight, lined by shops adorned with red and white banners and lanterns, and orange traffic cones on the right. Several pedestrians walk away in the mid-ground, a white bicycle is parked on the far left, and a person on a red bicycle approaches from the right.

In subsequent frames, the cyclist continues past the viewer to the bottom right, while the initial pedestrians recede further into the distance. Concurrently, a woman in a red dress and a man carrying bags emerge from the far end of the arcade, walking steadily towards the first-frame viewpoint as the perspective subtly advances.

The first frame depicts a covered shopping arcade with shops lining both sides, adorned with banners and lanterns, extending to a bright archway; in the foreground, a person in dark clothes walks away to the viewer's left, while a woman in red and a man in dark clothing approach from the right, and in the midground, an older man approaches centrally as another person in yellow walks away to the left.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the woman in the red dress and the man beside her, initially approaching from the right foreground, pass the camera's original position and move to the left and right sides of the first-frame's foreground. The older man in gray, initially in the midground approaching centrally, similarly passes the first-frame viewpoint and continues walking away towards its left side. The individuals walking away from the camera's initial position recede further into the distance within the arcade. Concurrently, previously obscured sections of the arcade further ahead, beyond the initial background, are revealed as the scene progresses.
