The initial frame captures a vibrant city street at night, with a prominent zebra crossing in the foreground. To the left, several dark cars are parked, while a large group of pedestrians waits on the right side of the crosswalk. In the midground, multiple buses are visible near active construction sites featuring cranes and an elevated walkway, all surrounded by illuminated high-rise buildings and bright digital billboards in the background.

Subsequently, the pedestrians on the right begin crossing the street, moving towards the viewer's left, as the buses positioned in the midground also start moving forward. Simultaneously, a large, brightly lit advertising truck emerges from the far right of the scene and drives across the street, passing behind the now-moving pedestrians, while the digital billboards in the background continuously change their displayed content.
