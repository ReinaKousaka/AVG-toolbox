In the first frame, a large, snow-covered, open-cage globe sculpture stands prominently in the midground, slightly to the right of the center, surrounded by a circular, snow-dusted railing and bushes. Behind it, and framing both sides, are tall, dark urban skyscrapers under a hazy, snowy sky with snowflakes visibly falling. In the foreground, an open black umbrella lies on the snow-covered ground, slightly left of the bottom center, while to its right, a person holding another black umbrella and a bag walks away from the viewer. To the far left foreground, two other individuals walk away from the viewer on a snow-covered path, near a snow-laden vendor cart.

The camera gradually zooms out, slightly widening the field of view. The two individuals on the left foreground continue walking away, slowly moving further out of frame to the left. The person on the right holding the umbrella also progresses forward and slightly right. Meanwhile, the open black umbrella on the ground in the bottom left foreground disappears from view as the camera movement continues.
