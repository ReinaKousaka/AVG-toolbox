The first frame shows a cobblestone village square. On the left, a light-colored building partially frames the view, alongside a grey building featuring green shutters, an arched red doorway, and a stone fountain in front. A cobblestone path leads into the distance, bordered by a wooden fence and a grassy area with a pine tree and blue banner, all against a backdrop of distant green mountains under a cloudy sky.

Subsequently, the viewpoint shifts slightly left, progressively revealing more of the light-colored building on the far left and uncovering a black car parked to the left of the grey building's doorway, previously obscured by the frame's initial boundary.

In the first frame, a rectangular stone fountain with water sits in the immediate foreground. To its left, a small black car is parked in front of a light gray building featuring a dark roof, green window shutters, and an arched wooden main door. A section of a yellow-toned building is visible on the far left. On the right, a cobblestone path curves away from the viewer, bordered by a wooden fence, leading towards other distant buildings, a blue banner, and a tree. A large, forested mountain range dominates the background on the right, under a cloudy sky.

end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly shifts leftward, gradually revealing more of the yellow-toned building on the extreme left. Concurrently, the blue banner and mountain to the right of the first-frame viewpoint progressively move towards the center of the frame. Minor changes in shadow patterns on the cobblestone ground also indicate slight alterations in lighting, likely due to cloud movement over time.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a cobblestone courtyard with a rectangular stone fountain in the center-midground. To the left stands a light gray building with a dark roof, featuring windows with green shutters and an arched doorway, with a black car parked to its far left. A path extends to the right, bordered by a wooden fence, leading towards a distant village and forested mountains under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the camera pans to the right, the black car and the leftmost portion of the building disappear from view. The red flowers near the fountain also move out of frame. Simultaneously, a blue banner attached to a lamppost on the right side of the path is progressively revealed and becomes fully visible, along with more of the grassy landscape and distant mountains to the right.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A light gray stone building with green-shuttered windows occupies the left side, with a partial view of a square basin in the bottom-left corner. A cobblestone path extends from the viewer towards the center, flanked on the right by a wooden fence along a grassy slope, where a lamppost with a blue banner stands. In the midground, a person walks on the path towards an intersection with distant buildings, all set against a background of forested mountains and a cloudy sky.
end of description
The camera moves forward and slightly to the left, causing the building on the left to gradually shift out of frame. The square basin in the bottom-left of the original viewpoint disappears early. Concurrently, the lamppost and blue banner on the right side of the original viewpoint move forward and then off-screen to the right. The person on the path continues walking further into the scene, diminishing in size, as more of the distant intersection and buildings further down the path are revealed.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a cobblestone path extends forward, flanked by a light-colored building with a stone base and a green-shuttered window on the left, and a wooden fence along a grassy slope with an evergreen tree on the right. Ahead, a person stands near an intersection with a paved road, beyond which are houses and mountains under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the building on the left recedes, revealing more of its facade, including additional windows and a doorway. Concurrently, the wooden fence on the right moves out of view. The cobblestone path continues ahead, bringing the intersection, a prominent "STOP" sign, and the distant houses closer within the forward view.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a cobblestone path descending towards an asphalt road intersection, flanked by a light-colored building with a window and partial door on the left, and a wooden fence on the right. A person walks down the path towards the intersection, beyond which a small town and forested mountains under a cloudy sky are visible.
end of description
As the camera moves forward along the path, more of the building's facade on the left, including a second window and the full brown door, is revealed. The person continues walking ahead and further away from the initial viewpoint, becoming smaller and drawing closer to the road ahead. The painted "STOP" sign on the cobblestones becomes fully visible further down the path as the scene unfolds.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a cobblestone road with "STOP" painted on it stretches from the viewer into the midground, merging with a wider asphalt road. To the viewer's immediate left, a wooden fence runs parallel to the cobblestone path, with green foliage visible behind it. On the right, a woman in a light green top and dark pants bends down, partially obscured by a wooden fence, with a light brown dog near her feet. The midground features an intersection surrounded by various white buildings with dark roofs, along with a prominent red stop sign and other traffic signs to the right. In the background, lush, tree-covered mountains dominate the horizon, topped by rocky peaks, all under a cloudy sky.
end of description
The woman and dog on the right move completely out of view, to the right of the first-frame viewpoint. Subsequently, a white horizontal barrier lowers across the main road in the midground, extending from the right side of the road towards the left. This barrier then rises and retracts back to its original position on the right. Concurrently, foliage to the left of the cobblestone road subtly shifts, making a circular traffic sign near the fence more prominent.
