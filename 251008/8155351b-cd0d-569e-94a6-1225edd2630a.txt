The first frame depicts a wide city street flanked by multi-story buildings and trees under a bright sky, stretching into the distance. On the left, a large red-brown building with ornate balconies and political banners stands prominently, while on the right, a lighter building features a parked car further down the street.

As the viewpoint advances along the street, the parked car on the right recedes, and a large white garbage truck becomes visible closer on the right side of the road, moving towards the viewer. The garbage truck then passes, revealing a person walking on the right sidewalk and a white pickup truck laden with sacks, now positioned further ahead on the right side of the street relative to the initial viewpoint. The continuous forward motion brings more distant buildings closer into view, while the initial roadside elements progressively move out of frame to the sides.

The first frame presents a street extending into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings on both the left and right. In the foreground and mid-ground, trees line the sidewalks, a dark green truck is parked on the left, a red kiosk-like structure stands on the left sidewalk, and a person walks on the distant right sidewalk. end of description. As the scene progresses, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the street; the truck on the left drives past the initial viewpoint to the left-rear, revealing extensive demolition and rubble on the adjacent building and sidewalk. The person on the right also moves past the initial viewpoint to the right-rear, while a red circular sign on the right sidewalk and construction barriers on the left become newly visible ahead of the original viewpoint. The car initially on the far right disappears to the right-rear of the original viewpoint.

The first frame displays a street scene with a dark asphalt road stretching into the distance. To the viewer's left, a severely damaged multi-story building with exposed rubble at its base stands prominently, partially obscured by temporary barriers. On the right, a multi-story building with storefronts, including "MISR TRAVEL," appears relatively intact, with a dark grey bin in the lower right foreground and several individuals visible further down the sidewalk. In the midground, directly ahead, a tall, modern building with a distinct blue facade rises above the other structures, all beneath a pale, overcast sky.
end of description
A person in dark attire appears on the right sidewalk, walking towards the viewer from the midground. Subsequently, two dogs emerge on the left sidewalk near the rubble pile, also moving towards the viewer, soon joined by a third. Both the individual on the right and the group of dogs on the left progressively draw nearer to the first-frame viewpoint. Eventually, the person exits the frame to the right, while the dogs continue their approach on the left sidewalk.
