The first frame depicts a wet urban street scene on an overcast day. In the foreground, white crosswalk stripes traverse the wet asphalt. To the viewer's right, a red cylindrical bollard and a green patterned trash bin stand on the sidewalk. In the midground, a "SUSHIACO" storefront is prominently displayed on the right, with other businesses extending down the street. Pedestrians carrying umbrellas walk on the wet sidewalk to the right of the viewer. To the left, a traffic light pole with a "W 36 St" sign and a "Buses Only" sign stands beside a tree, with a yellow bus parked behind construction barriers on the street. A dark vehicle is partially visible on the far right. Tall buildings line both sides of the street, receding into the background.

In the subsequent frames, the dark vehicle positioned on the far right rapidly moves forward and exits the frame to the right of the viewer's initial position. Simultaneously, pedestrians on the right-hand sidewalk continue to walk forward, further down the street from the viewer. The yellow bus on the left side of the street remains largely stationary relative to the viewer's position, though a person is seen walking past its rear section.

The first frame displays a wet city street and sidewalk under an overcast sky, with a traffic pole featuring a red 'Don't Walk' signal and vehicular lights to the left, and a yellow bus receding in the street. On the right, a green trash receptacle and red cylindrical barrier stand before a 'SUSHIACO' storefront, while two pedestrians walk away down the sidewalk.
end of description
The red pedestrian signal on the left changes to an orange 'walk' icon, then back to red, and subsequently cycles through a red 'Don't Walk' countdown. Simultaneously, the yellow bus and the two pedestrians continue moving further away from the viewer, and a new A-frame sign appears on the far right near the 'SUSHIACO' storefront.

The first frame shows a wet city street and sidewalk extending into the distance, flanked by tall buildings. To the immediate left, a traffic light pole with a "Don't Walk" signal stands next to orange barriers and a parked yellow bus, with a green tree visible beyond. On the right, storefronts like "SUSHI & CO" and "ROMA PIZZA" line the sidewalk, where several pedestrians and a person on a bicycle are moving away from the viewer.
end of description
In the following frames, the person on the bicycle and the pedestrians on the sidewalk steadily recede further down the street, moving away from the viewer's original position. The viewpoint subtly tracks forward, causing a "COMING SOON!" sign on a storefront to the right of the viewer to become more prominent as the scene progresses.

The first frame displays a wet city street and sidewalk extending into the distance under a grey sky. In the left foreground, a yellow newspaper stand and a dark sandwich board are visible, while further back on the street are a tree, parked bicycles, a yellow bus, and tall buildings. To the right, commercial storefronts like "ROMA PIZZA" and a "COMING SOON" sign line the sidewalk, where several pedestrians walk away from the viewer.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the pedestrians continue moving further away from the viewer down the street, with the individual in the yellow jacket proceeding deeper on the left sidewalk and others advancing on the right, without revealing any new objects or scenes.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a wet city street and sidewalk under an overcast sky. In the foreground, a concrete sidewalk leads away from the viewer, with a metal grate on the left. Along the left side, a street shows a yellow bus and a lighter bus moving away, alongside orange barriers, trees, and parked bicycles. On the right, a building houses "ROMA PIZZA" with outdoor seating and black bins, plus an orange "COMING SOON" banner. Two pedestrians walk towards the viewer on the sidewalk: one in a yellow jacket in the mid-ground, followed by another in white.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, the person in the yellow jacket steadily advances closer towards the viewer on the sidewalk, shifting from the mid-ground's center-right towards the center-left. The person in the white top behind them also continues to approach. Several other pedestrians further down the street gradually become more distinct as they walk along the distant sidewalk, all remaining ahead of the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame displays a rainy city street scene from a ground-level viewpoint. In the foreground on the right, a person in a yellow-green hooded jacket walks towards the left, past several black trash cans and a red 'ROMA PIZZA' sandwich board on the sidewalk. To the left, a yellow bus is stopped on the wet street, with orange construction barriers beyond it. The midground features a row of storefronts on the right, including 'ROMA PIZZA' with outdoor seating and potted plants, and multiple bicycles chained to a rack next to trees on the left. Further down the sidewalk, other pedestrians are visible, while tall buildings line both sides of the street under an overcast sky in the background.

end of description

The person in the yellow-green jacket continues walking towards the right side of the frame, moving past the trash cans and gradually out of view. Simultaneously, the yellow bus on the left side of the street begins to move slowly forward, driving further away from the viewer along the street. Other pedestrians in the midground continue walking further into the scene.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a rainy city street scene. To the immediate right, a red "ROMA PIZZA EST. 1985" sign stands next to a black trash can, with light-colored outdoor tables and chairs arranged behind it along a storefront. Four evergreen trees in striped pots line the sidewalk further back on the right. On the left, several bicycles are parked at a rack, while a yellow bus and a white bus are stationary on the wet street. Multiple pedestrians walk away from the viewer down the center of the wet sidewalk, with tall buildings receding into the misty background.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the yellow bus on the left side of the street gradually moves forward, revealing more of the white bus previously obscured behind it. Simultaneously, the pedestrians in the midground continue walking further away from the viewer along the sidewalk. The rain consistently falls across the entire scene, creating continuous ripples on the reflective wet surfaces.
