The first frame presents a wide view of a city street looking forward, lined by tall, classical buildings on both sides under a clear blue sky. On the near left, a group of pedestrians walks away from the viewer, including a man with a grey beard and a woman in sunglasses carrying a colorful bag and waving, adjacent to a black lamppost with a green "Avinguda de l'Oest" sign and a building displaying "Kopp" and "ANF" logos. On the near right, a row of grey and brown waste bins extends into the midground, fronted by a yellow barrier, a wooden bench with a person seated, and a bare-branched tree, with a blue "P" parking sign further along. Decorative white light fixtures are suspended across the street overhead, which narrows towards a distinctive reddish-brown building in the far right background.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the street. The initial group of pedestrians on the left continue walking away from the viewer, receding into the midground. Simultaneously, new individuals appear from the left, with one woman in a white jacket and mask becoming visible walking towards the viewer on the near left sidewalk. The lamppost and storefronts on the left, and the row of waste bins on the right, all shift slightly closer to the viewer's perspective.

In the first frame, a narrow city street or pedestrian area stretches into the background under a blue sky, flanked by tall multi-story buildings. To the viewer's immediate left, a woman in a white jacket and mask walks away, near a dark-fronted building displaying "ANPE" and "Kopp" signs, beside a yellow public bin and potted plants. To the viewer's right, a row of four grey recycling bins with varied colored lids lines the sidewalk, with a distinctive reddish-brown building visible in the distant background. White circular decorative lights are strung overhead across the street.

The viewpoint steadily moves forward down the street. The pedestrian and the initial yellow bin on the left exit the frame as the "Kopp" shop front becomes more centered on the left. On the right, the recycling bins move progressively out of frame, revealing more of the sidewalk and buildings. A person in yellow pants appears walking towards the viewer on the right sidewalk, then passes. Another group of pedestrians on the left sidewalk approaches the viewer as the perspective advances further into the street.

The first frame depicts a wide city street flanked by multi-story buildings, receding into the distance under a blue sky. In the foreground, a yellow bin and a sign are on the far left, while two grey bins with blue lids are on the far right; two individuals walk towards the viewer on the left sidewalk, near potted plants, with more pedestrians and yellow barriers further ahead.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the initial foreground bins on both sides recede and eventually disappear from view. On the left, a cafe with outdoor seating and patrons becomes increasingly prominent, revealing the "PEPE BUCATO" sign on its facade as it moves closer to the viewer's immediate left.
