The first frame captures a bustling Times Square street scene with a man in a blue shirt and shorts in the mid-foreground, facing away, and a large black gorilla character beyond him to the left, positioned on all fours. To the immediate right are "Times Square" recycling bins, while further left, a white arched scaffolding, pedestrians, and an outdoor seating area with red tables are visible, all framed by distant tall buildings with vibrant billboards and a street with vehicles to the right.

In the following frames, the man in the blue shirt walks further away from the viewer and slightly rightward on the path, while the gorilla character adjusts its posture, shifting its weight but remaining in its general mid-ground position relative to the initial viewpoint.
