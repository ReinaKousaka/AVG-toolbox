The initial frame presents a bustling city street with a gray paved sidewalk on the left, an adjacent red bike path, and a green hedge bordering a multi-lane road on the right. A multi-story building featuring "Audi" signage dominates the far left, with parked cars lining the sidewalk. On the road to the mid-right, a green bus is visible alongside other traffic, while trees and a blue circular sign indicating shared pedestrian and bicycle use stand further right.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly pans left, gradually expanding the view of the "Audi" building and parked cars previously on the frame's far left. Simultaneously, people on the sidewalk continue walking further into the background relative to the viewer's initial position, while the green bus and other vehicles on the midground road proceed forward and to the right, becoming less central to the original viewpoint as the blue sign and trees also shift further right.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
On the left, a black Audi e-tron SUV is parked on a paved sidewalk, followed by several other cars. Adjacent to these cars, a building with large glass windows displays "Audi" and "Audi Tunnel" signage. To the right of the viewer, separated by a low green hedge, runs a red bike path parallel to a street with visible traffic. Further down on the right, trees, a street lamp, and a blue circular pedestrian/bicycle sign are visible, with distant buildings and a cloudy sky in the background.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly shifts forward, revealing more of the street ahead. Pedestrians on the sidewalk and a person jogging on the red bike path move progressively further away from the viewer. Vehicles on the street in the mid-distance also advance, while a Korean flag on a pole to the right becomes more prominent.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a street view with a multi-story building on the left, identified as an 'Audi Jamil' dealership, featuring large glass windows and parked Audi vehicles, including a black Audi e-tron closest to the viewer. A paved sidewalk with a yellow tactile strip runs from the foreground center into the distance, where two people walk away from the viewer. To the right, a red-paved path, separated by a low green hedge, leads into the background; a person in a grey shirt and mask walks towards the viewer on this path. Beyond the hedge and path are several trees, a street with various vehicles moving away and towards the viewer, and numerous city buildings and distant skyscrapers under an overcast sky.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the person on the red path to the right moves progressively closer to the viewer. Simultaneously, the two individuals walking on the left sidewalk continue to advance further into the distance. Vehicles on the street in the background, including a white truck and a yellow taxi, are observed slowly moving away from the viewer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a city street viewed from a sidewalk, with parked Audis (including a dark e-tron foreground-left) lining an "Audi Jamsil" building to the left. A central sidewalk, featuring a yellow tactile strip, extends towards distant buildings and traffic, flanked by a red bike lane and trees to the right, where two pedestrians are visible moving in opposing directions.
end of description
The man initially walking towards the viewer on the right moves closer and then out of the frame, passing the viewer's immediate foreground. Simultaneously, a cyclist, initially further down the bike lane on the right, moves towards the viewer's position, passing where the first man was, while the other pedestrian continues walking away on the sidewalk.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame features a silver Audi and a black car parked on the immediate left, beside a building with "Jamsil" signage. On the right, a cyclist approaches on a red bike path near a tree, while a pedestrian walks away on the central sidewalk towards distant city buildings and traffic under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the parked cars on the left recede behind the viewer, and the pedestrian continues further into the background. The cyclist on the right moves closer to the viewer's original position before passing behind them. More of the street, including additional vehicles and a green scooter, becomes visible further ahead and to the right, revealing new sections of the buildings on both sides.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a city sidewalk viewed from a low angle, with a light-colored car partially visible in the foreground left and a dark blue SUV parked behind it, adjacent to a building with reflective windows. Further down the sidewalk, a person walks away from the viewer. To the right, a tree stands next to a red-paved path that leads to a street with distant traffic and multiple tall buildings under an overcast sky.
end of description
As frames progress, the pedestrian on the sidewalk continues moving further away from the viewer into the scene's depth. Simultaneously, a red scooter emerges from the right mid-ground, traversing the street horizontally across the frame, while other vehicles in the distance also proceed.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the foreground left, a dark blue SUV is parked next to a sidewalk where a person walks away from the viewer, paralleling a building with large reflective windows. Ahead and to the right, a white truck is stopped at an intersection with a crosswalk, traffic lights, and street poles, while green bushes line the near right. Numerous high-rise buildings fill the background under an overcast sky.
end of description
Subsequently, the person on the left sidewalk and another individual in red on the far right crosswalk both continue walking further away from the first-frame viewpoint. The white truck and the broader urban scenery remain static throughout the sequence.
