A road with yellow pedestrian crossing stripes extends directly ahead of the viewer. To the immediate left are two green trash bins and a pedestrian sign, with residential buildings further along the road. On the right, a large building with dark wood, white walls, and green shutters stands alongside a sidewalk and a stone retaining wall with wooden railings. In the background, green mountains with snow-capped peaks rise under an overcast sky.

The viewpoint progresses forward along the road. The green bins, pedestrian sign, and the large building on the right gradually move out of view to the left and right, respectively, behind the first-frame viewpoint. A large dark billboard appears on the far left, moving into the frame from the left side of the initial viewpoint. The stone wall on the right and other buildings on the left recede into the distance as the viewer moves forward.

The first frame presents a paved road extending into the distance, with a light brown building and a metal railing on the left, and a stone retaining wall supporting a grassy slope with a dark wooden building on the right. Distant green mountains, some snow-capped, define the background under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the right-side retaining wall recedes, revealing more of the grassy slope and a dirt path leading to the building's entrance. Concurrently, a small white vehicle becomes visible behind the railing on the left, and a streetlight appears further ahead on the right, all relative to the initial viewpoint.

A paved road with white dashed lines extends forward from the viewer. To the left, a light-colored building with white shutters, a metal guardrail, and a white parked vehicle are visible, with a smaller reddish-brown building further behind. On the right, a darker chalet-style building is situated on an uphill grassy slope, with a streetlamp positioned further ahead along the road. Green mountains with cloudy peaks and some snow patches dominate the distant background under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the streetlamp on the right progressively shifts towards the upper-right of the frame and eventually exits. The buildings on both sides, including the light-colored one on the left and the chalet on the right, appear closer and rise towards the upper edges of the frame relative to the initial viewpoint. The white vehicle parked on the left approaches and then moves towards the upper-left as the viewer passes it. The distant mountains remain visible, confirming continuous forward movement through the valley.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a two-lane asphalt road extending forward from the viewer, with white double lines down its center. To the left, a paved sidewalk/shoulder runs alongside a silver guardrail, behind which is a green grassy slope leading to a brown wooden house with a red roof. Further left, beyond the house, are more green hills and distant mountains with snow-capped peaks under a cloudy sky. To the right of the road, a grassy embankment slopes upwards, featuring stone retaining walls, steps, and multiple wooden chalet-style houses built into the hillside. A small, light-colored car is parked on the shoulder to the right, adjacent to the embankment.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the wooden house on the left shifts further left relative to the initial position and appears larger. The road ahead continuously reveals more of the path, while the grassy embankment on the right becomes more prominent, showcasing detailed stone stairs and multiple houses. The parked car on the right becomes clearly visible as a dark SUV, and a black bicycle becomes newly visible parked just ahead of it, closer to the viewer's current position on the right side of the road.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a view down a two-lane road curving slightly right into a mountainous valley under a cloudy sky. To the immediate left, a traditional brown wooden house with a red roof stands behind a silver railing, with green fields and distant mountains beyond. To the immediate right, a black SUV is parked beside a paved shoulder, with stairs leading up to a partially visible building further right, and a stone wall separating the road from an ascending grassy slope.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the black SUV on the right recedes and disappears from view, while a street lamp pole on the right emerges from behind the initial buildings and moves past the viewer. The houses on both sides shift backwards and out of frame, revealing more of the steep grassy embankment on the right, and offering a clearer, closer view of the distant green mountains. A small yellow vehicle becomes visible in the far-off valley on the left side of the road.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a paved road curving slightly to the left in the foreground, with a solid white line on its right edge and a double solid white line in the center. To the road's immediate right is a sidewalk bordered by a stone retaining wall and a steep grassy hillside ascending towards a house with a brown roof at the upper right. To the road's left, a metal guardrail separates it from a steep grassy valley with distant green hills and houses, backed by mountains under a cloudy sky, with a yellow object partly visible behind the guardrail.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the guardrail and yellow object on the left progressively move out of frame to the left, revealing more of the valley and distant mountains. Simultaneously, the grassy hillside, stone retaining wall, and house on the right move closer to the viewer and eventually pass by, with new sections of the wall and hillside being continuously revealed from the right. The overall scene, including the distant mountainous landscape, appears to shift subtly as the foreground changes, indicating forward motion.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a winding gray asphalt road with a solid white centerline extending from the viewer's position into the midground, curving slightly to the right. To the left of the road is a green grassy verge backed by a metal guardrail, beyond which lie lush green valleys dotted with small chalets and distant forested mountains on the far left. To the right of the road, a sidewalk runs alongside a stacked stone retaining wall topped with grass and small yellow flowers, behind which a tall conifer tree stands, and several traditional buildings are nestled into a steep, grassy hillside. Overcast clouds dominate the sky, partially obscuring the mountain peaks in the background.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the curving road, the white centerline and the guardrail on the left extend closer to the viewer. On the right, the stone wall and sidewalk pass by, revealing more of the steep, grassy bank and traditional wooden houses further ahead on the hillside. The tall conifer tree on the right recedes into the background, bringing into view a lamppost and more of the architecture behind it. An uphill path also becomes visible to the right of the sidewalk, ascending towards the cluster of buildings.
