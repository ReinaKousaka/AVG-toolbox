The first frame shows a woman in a floral dress on the left, leaning over a bed that occupies the central and right portions of the view, featuring white bedding, patterned pillows, and a gray striped blanket. Behind the bed, a large multi-paneled window reveals a lush green hillside, while a nightstand with a blue and white lamp is positioned to the viewer's left, and another wooden nightstand with a vase and a small wooden bench with containers are to the right.
