In the first frame, a man with a black backpack is prominently centered, his back to the viewer. To his left, a covered walkway extends into the distance, lined with reflective shop windows displaying mannequins; a man in a striped shirt walks past these shops, away from the viewer's immediate left. A woman with a shark-mouth backpack and a red bag walks further down this left path. To the right of the central man, a bustling street opens up, featuring a woman in a green hoodie and another with curly hair in black leggings, both walking away from the viewer. In the mid-ground, a large digital billboard on a building displays a woman's face, while the entire scene rests on a checkered tiled floor.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the covered walkway, causing the man with the backpack and other people previously in the mid-ground to recede further into the distance relative to the viewer. New pedestrians emerge further down the walkway and on the street to the right. Orange and white construction barriers become more distinct on the street to the right, beyond the initial figures. The architecture of buildings further down the street also becomes clearer as the scene advances.

The first frame displays a man with a black backpack prominently in the foreground, slightly right of center, walking away from the viewer on a checkered tiled walkway. To his left and slightly ahead is a woman with a grey shark-design backpack and a red bag, while to his right, a woman in a light jacket walks alongside him; all are moving along the walkway. To the left, a row of glass storefronts with merchandise extends into the distance under an overhead awning, opposite an open street on the right featuring buildings with columns and large digital billboards displaying various advertisements.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily moves forward along the walkway, causing the foreground pedestrians to recede further into the distance relative to the continually advancing camera. The environment ahead of the initial viewpoint is gradually revealed, including more of the shops to the left and the street and buildings to the right. The digital billboards on the far right dynamically change their displayed content. The orange and white barriers, initially on the right side of the street, gradually move out of view as the camera passes them, indicating continuous forward motion.

The first frame captures a pedestrian street scene looking forward along a covered walkway with storefronts on the left under a brown colonnade, and a wider street with distant buildings on the right. In the immediate foreground, the backs of a man with a black backpack and a woman in a green hoodie are prominent, followed by other walkers like a woman carrying a red bag and a shark-mouthed backpack.

Subsequently, the man and the woman in green move further away and slightly to the right of their initial first-frame positions. The woman with the shark backpack and red bag also advances further down the walkway, staying within the center-left area relative to the first-frame viewpoint. A new woman in a brown jacket and blue hat, holding a black bag, then emerges from the left side of the first-frame's perspective and walks forward.

The first frame captures a busy urban promenade with a checkered tiled walkway, storefronts including 'ADIDAS MILANO' along the viewer's left, and a street with buildings featuring a large digital billboard on the right. Numerous pedestrians walk away from the viewer, notably one on the immediate left in a blue hat and others with backpacks directly ahead.

As the viewpoint progresses forward, the person initially on the far left moves out of frame to the left. The distant digital billboard on the right, which was ahead and to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, dynamically changes its display from abstract imagery to text and then to colorful patterns, appearing closer as the camera advances.
