The viewer is positioned in a wide, well-lit indoor corridor with a reflective, checkered tiled floor. To the right, the "TRUE FOOD KITCHEN" entrance features a black facade, a wooden slatted interior wall, hanging greenery, and multiple suspended light fixtures, with a person standing inside near a counter. To the left, a glass-fronted store displaying "BloomStem CBD" reveals a yellow armchair and plants, next to an open archway leading further down the corridor where a directional sign hangs overhead.

As the frames progress, a person in a light-colored shirt and dark shorts appears on the left, walking away from the viewer down the corridor, gradually moving past the "BloomStem CBD" store. Other individuals are also seen moving further into the distance down the corridor to the left. The architectural elements and storefronts on the right and left remain stationary relative to the initial viewpoint.
