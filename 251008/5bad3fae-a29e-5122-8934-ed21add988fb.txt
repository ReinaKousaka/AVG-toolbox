A wet urban street scene is viewed from a slightly elevated position, with a black metal fence running diagonally from the lower left, separating a broad, wet sidewalk on the right from a multi-lane road on the left. A large yellow bus, facing away from the viewer with illuminated brake lights, occupies the mid-ground on the left lane, with a red and white bus partially visible behind it and a dark car behind the yellow bus. To the right, the sidewalk is lined with small trees in grassy beds and a continuous row of storefront buildings extending into the misty distance under an overcast sky.

The yellow bus and the dark car behind it slowly advance on the wet street, revealing more of the queued traffic, including a red and white bus. A white car emerges from behind the dark car and also moves forward, disappearing further into the background. Subsequently, a dark UPS truck becomes visible further back on the left, behind the red and white bus. A red fire hydrant appears on the sidewalk to the right of the yellow bus, and a person with an umbrella is briefly seen walking on the distant sidewalk. The sequence shows a gradual, forward movement of vehicles and pedestrians on the rainy road.

In the first frame, a wet city street stretches into the distance on the left, separated from a paved sidewalk by a black metal fence and a narrow strip of grass. A yellow school bus with its rear facing the viewer is prominent in the mid-ground left, behind which are a white car and other larger buses in traffic. A red fire hydrant stands on the grassy strip near the viewer, directly to the left of a series of young trees lining the sidewalk. To the right, the sidewalk is bordered by a long row of neatly trimmed hedges, behind which multi-story buildings with storefronts extend into the background.

Throughout the following frames, the red brake lights of the yellow bus repeatedly illuminate and dim, while the white car behind it also shows its brake lights flickering. On the paved sidewalk to the right, a person holding an umbrella is seen walking away from the viewer, gradually moving further down the sidewalk toward the background buildings. The overall traffic on the street appears to remain largely stationary during this time.

The first frame shows a wet city street from a low-angle viewpoint, with a yellow bus and a partially visible white car stopped on the wet road to the viewer's left, their brake lights off. A red fire hydrant and black metal fencing are in the immediate foreground left, separating the road from a paved sidewalk with grassy inserts. To the right, buildings with storefronts line the street, and a pedestrian holding an umbrella walks further down the sidewalk away from the viewer.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the yellow bus and the white car to the viewer's left intermittently flash their brake lights on and off as they slowly advance forward further down the street. Simultaneously, the pedestrian on the right sidewalk continues walking away from the viewer.
