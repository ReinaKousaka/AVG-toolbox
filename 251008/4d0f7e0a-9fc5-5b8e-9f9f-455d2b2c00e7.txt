The first frame depicts a wet city street on a rainy day, with a sidewalk on the left featuring a green bike path and storefronts, including Shinhan Bank. A row of trees and a black railing separate the sidewalk from the street on the right, where several cars are visible, along with a tall building further down the road. end of description.
As the frames progress, the rain continues steadily while vehicles on the street dynamically move forward; a white SUV initially on the right drives out of view, followed by other cars. A yellow vehicle then appears in the middle distance on the street, moving towards the viewer's left, as a person with an umbrella walks on the sidewalk further down the street, moving away from the viewer.

The first frame depicts a rainy urban street with a wet sidewalk featuring a green lane on the left, alongside storefronts and a line of trees extending into the distance. To the right, a black fence borders a wet street where a yellow taxi and a dark SUV are among several vehicles moving further from the viewer, with distant buildings under a hazy sky. end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the yellow taxi and the dark SUV, along with other vehicles, continue to drive from right to left across the wet street, gradually moving further from the viewer. Simultaneously, pedestrians with umbrellas on the far left sidewalk also progress further into the distance, as the consistent rainfall persists over the entire scene.
