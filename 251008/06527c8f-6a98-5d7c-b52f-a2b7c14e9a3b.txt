The first frame presents a paved road with white arrows and a yellow center line, curving slightly ahead, flanked by lush green grass banks and numerous tall trees under a bright blue sky. A red circular 'two-way traffic' sign and a distant white car are visible on the right side of the road, with some white litter near the bottom right foreground.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the road markings and surrounding landscape continuously shift, with the white litter exiting the bottom right. The two-way traffic sign and the white car on the right approach the viewer's position, while a dark pole emerges from behind the left grass bank and also moves closer.
