frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame shows a view from between train tracks looking forward. To the left, a white and red train is stopped at a platform next to a building, while to the right, another set of tracks runs parallel to a body of water with distant buildings and a hillside under an overcast sky, all with overhead power lines.

end of description

As frames progress, the train on the left platform begins to move forward and to the left, steadily disappearing from view. Subsequently, a station sign reading "Drammen" is revealed on the platform to the left as the train completely departs the scene.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame presents a train station scene with three tracks extending forward into the distance, a stationary silver train parked at a platform on the left foreground, and a wide river flowing parallel to the tracks on the right, bordered by distant buildings and hills under an overcast sky. Overhead, a network of catenary wires and support structures spans the scene, and a blue 'Drammen' sign is visible on the left platform.
end of description
As the frames advance, the viewpoint moves forward along the central track; the prominent catenary pole and the stationary train on the left platform progressively move closer before exiting the frame to the left and behind the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, the distant covered station structure further down the left track, the bridge in the center-background, and the buildings on the left all become gradually closer to the viewer's perspective.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The viewer is positioned on train tracks, looking forward at two parallel track sets. To the left, a silver train is parked at a platform next to modern buildings, while a body of water, buildings, and a forested mountain are to the right. A station canopy and a bridge are visible centrally in the middle distance under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the train and platform on the left recede, revealing more details like platform lights and "FLYTOGET" on the train before they pass out of frame to the left. The distant bridge appears to approach the viewer directly ahead.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a train station scene from a viewpoint between two sets of tracks. To the left is a train platform with a yellow safety line, a dark train partially visible at its edge, a dark-roofed canopy covering part of the platform where several people are present, and a large building complex behind it. In the center, a set of train tracks leads into the distance under overhead power lines, with another set of tracks to its right, adjacent to a grassy bank, a body of water, parked cars, and buildings with green hills beyond. A bridge spans the scene in the distant background.
end of description
In subsequent frames, subtle movement occurs on the left platform as people shift positions and a sign near the platform edge changes its displayed text to "Drammen". Chronologically, the dark train on the left platform begins to move forward, gradually exiting the frame towards the background. As the train departs, more of the station platform and the people seated there become fully visible on the left, uncovering portions previously obscured by the train.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, the viewer looks down a set of train tracks extending into the distance under an overcast sky. To the left, a long station platform with a dark, covered canopy runs parallel to the tracks, partially obscuring a parked train and several people beneath it. Overhead power lines crisscross above the central tracks. To the right, another set of tracks runs alongside a grassy bank, a fence, a body of water, and a distant bridge; further right, hills with buildings rise in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the central tracks, causing the previously distant train on the left platform to gradually become more visible and move closer to the viewer's immediate left. Details of the train and station, including a clock and signage on the platform, emerge more clearly as the viewpoint advances. People on the platform, initially further down, become prominent then recede towards the left and behind the original viewpoint. Concurrently, the distant bridge and water, initially ahead and to the right, draw closer before also shifting further to the right and eventually behind the initial viewpoint. The entire scene dynamically shifts as the viewer travels along the tracks.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A train station scene is visible from the perspective of being on the tracks. To the left, a platform with a dark canopy shades a stationary train alongside it, where several people are standing or sitting. In the center, two sets of train tracks extend into the distance, with a grassy area to their right, leading to a river or lake bordered by a low fence. Beyond the water, a bridge spans across, and distant hills with buildings at their base are visible under an overcast sky.
end of description
Starting from the third frame, people on the left platform begin boarding the train, which remains stationary to the left of the viewer. By the fifth frame, more passengers are seen boarding or walking on the platform, still to the left. The train on the left platform then starts to move forward, receding away from the viewer's initial position along the tracks to the left. As the train departs, fewer people are visible on the platform, and its front cars steadily move further down the tracks away from the first-frame viewpoint. The scenery to the right, including the adjacent tracks, river, bridge, and distant hills, remains constant relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
From the viewpoint on train tracks extending ahead and curving left, a covered platform with a white and red train is visible to the left, while parallel tracks run to the right alongside a body of water. In the distance, a bridge spans the water, with hills and buildings beyond it, under an overcast sky and overhead power lines.
end of description
In subsequent frames, several people progressively appear and gather on the platform to the viewer's left, some standing and others with luggage like a turquoise suitcase, steadily increasing their numbers while waiting on the stationary platform.
