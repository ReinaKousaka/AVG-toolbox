In the first frame, a white Kia Picanto is parked on the wet asphalt road in the foreground, facing away from the viewer, with a yellow curb to its right. To the left, the wet road reflects vibrant green and colorful lights from commercial buildings lining the street, where another white SUV is parked further back. Streetlights illuminate the scene, and trees are visible along the sidewalks, leading into the background where more buildings disappear into the rainy night.

A silver sedan then emerges from the distant background, traveling leftward along the wet road towards the viewer. It passes the parked white SUV on the left side of the street, reflecting the colorful lights on its wet surface. The sedan continues its trajectory, moving across the middle ground and eventually exiting the frame to the viewer's left. Throughout the sequence, the wet road continues to reflect the city lights, and precipitation is visible.
