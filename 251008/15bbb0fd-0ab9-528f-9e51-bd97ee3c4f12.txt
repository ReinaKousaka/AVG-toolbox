The first frame depicts an underwater coral reef, with various brown and textured coral formations in the foreground and mid-ground, alongside a prominent patch of white coral in the lower left. A large school of small, silvery-blue fish hovers above the mid-ground coral, while further away in the upper background, a school of yellow fish swims in the open blue water.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts, causing the foreground coral to move slightly to the right and downwards relative to its initial position. The school of blue fish actively disperses and shifts further to the right and deeper into the mid-ground, while the distant yellow fish continue to swim and reform their cluster in the upper background.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame showcases an extensive underwater coral reef dominating the foreground and mid-ground, featuring diverse textures including prominent brown branching corals centrally and lighter formations towards the far left and right. Above the central coral, a dense school of small blueish-silver fish hovers, while a larger school of yellow fish swims actively further back and to the right in the clear blue water.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, both the blueish-silver fish near the central coral and the yellow fish in the background continuously swim and shift their formations. A "Scenic Relaxation" watermark also progressively appears in the bottom-left corner of the frame relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame captures a vibrant underwater coral reef. In the foreground and midground, a large, intricate brown branched coral structure dominates the left and center, surrounded by various smaller coral formations and rocky seabed towards the bottom and right. A school of small, light blue fish hovers above and within this central coral, while a larger school of yellow-tailed fish swims in the clear blue water further in the background, to the right.
end of description
Over the subsequent frames, the school of small blue fish continuously drifts slightly rightward within the central coral, while the yellow-tailed fish in the background move further right and subtly recede from the initial viewpoint. A small yellow and white fish emerges from behind the coral in the mid-right, swimming towards the right edge of the frame, newly visible relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The overall scene subtly shifts rightward, as if the camera is drifting, incrementally revealing more of the seabed and coral structures towards the right of the initial view.
