In the first frame, the viewer faces a narrow asphalt street stretching uphill. Immediately in front, yellow road markings resembling a grid and Korean characters are visible on the street, with a "30" marking further ahead. To the immediate right, the rear bumper of a white sedan is partially visible, parked parallel to the street; behind it, a dark sedan is also parked. Adjacent to these cars on the right is a multi-story building with light-colored siding and numerous windows. On the left side of the street, a black metal gate and a red brick wall extend from the foreground into the midground, topped by a two-story brick building with a small green tree. In the background, the street curves gently upwards, revealing more distant buildings and a white van, all beneath a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily advances forward along the street. The initial foreground objects, such as the black gate on the left and the rear of the white car on the right, progressively move towards the background and eventually out of the frame. New sections of the road with yellow markings continuously emerge into the foreground as the previous ones shift into the midground. The distant white van, initially in the background relative to the first-frame viewpoint, appears incrementally closer as the street ahead unfolds. The perspective subtly shifts, gradually revealing more of the street's ascending path.

The first frame displays a narrow urban street bordered by a brick building and a black gate on the left, and a light grey multi-story building on the right, where a white car and a dark car are parked. The street, marked with yellow diagonals and a white '30', recedes towards distant buildings and a white van under a blue sky with power lines overhead.
end of description
In the following frames, a shadow dynamically moves from the right side of the street progressively towards the left, gradually revealing more of the yellow markings and the white '30' sign on the road. No new objects or scenes are introduced; only the illumination shifts across the static streetscape from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a narrow street looking forward, bordered by a brick wall and brown fence on the left, and a tall grey building on the right. A white car is partially visible in the immediate right foreground, with a black sedan parked just beyond it on the right side. The street features yellow markings, a '30' speed limit, and Korean text, leading towards a distant white van under a blue sky with power lines overhead.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts slightly forward and to the right. This reveals more of the black sedan's rear and introduces an orange traffic cone on the right sidewalk next to the car, along with additional orange cylindrical markers further up the street on the right. More Korean text also becomes visible on the road surface ahead of the black car.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a narrow urban street extending forward, flanked by a red brick building with a garage door on the left and a light-colored building on the right. A black car is parked on the right side of the street, prominently in the lower right foreground, while the road surface features a large '30' marking and Korean text ahead.
end of description
As the sequence unfolds, the viewpoint progresses forward along the street. The black car parked on the right moves forward and eventually exits the frame to the right, revealing more of the white building on that side. Concurrently, the speed limit marking on the asphalt in the foreground changes from '30' to '20', and a white stop sign appears beside the orange bollards on the right.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a residential street extending into the distance under a blue sky with scattered clouds. In the immediate foreground on the right, part of a black car is visible, followed by three orange traffic cones holding potted green plants, and a white 'no parking' sign. The asphalt road in the foreground and mid-ground features white Korean text and yellow lane markings. To the left, a brick wall with a closed garage door is prominent, continuing into more brick walls and structures further down. On the right, a light grey building with multiple windows stands beside a white wall and additional green foliage. A white van is parked in the street further ahead in the central background, with utility poles and overhead wires crisscrossing the sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, the black car on the lower right and the garage door on the lower left recede and move out of the frame. The orange cones and potted plants on the right also recede, eventually disappearing as the viewer moves past them. Concurrently, the street ahead and the buildings on both sides, previously in the mid-background, become closer and larger. A purple utility pole emerges into the lower left foreground as the scene unfolds.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a narrow, uphill street flanked by buildings. In the foreground on the right are three potted shrubs with orange signs, while a brick wall lines the left, and white Korean characters are painted on the asphalt directly in front. A white van is parked in the far midground on the left, with utility lines overhead and a red-brown spire visible above buildings in the left background under a blue sky.

end of description

Over the subsequent frames, the most notable dynamic change is the gradual shifting and lengthening of shadows across the street on the ground plane, moving from the left side further towards the right, increasingly covering the painted Korean characters.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a narrow paved street extending forward under a blue sky with clouds, lined by buildings. To the viewer's left is a red brick building with steps, and to the immediate right, a large green shrub in a planter and an orange 'No Parking' sign are prominent. Overhead, utility poles and a dense network of wires are visible, with a parked silver van further down the street.
end of description
As the perspective moves forward, the orange sign and green shrub on the right recede out of frame to the right of the original viewpoint. Consequently, objects previously further ahead, such as the white wall and distant buildings on both sides, are progressively revealed and appear closer as the viewer advances along the street.
