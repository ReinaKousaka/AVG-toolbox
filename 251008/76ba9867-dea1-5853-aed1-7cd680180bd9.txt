The first frame shows a snow-covered railway track extending forward from the viewer, curving gently to the right in the distance under a grey, overcast sky. To the left, a dense forest with mostly bare deciduous trees and some evergreens rises on a snow-covered embankment. To the right, a less dense wooded area also covered in snow parallels the tracks. Overhead power lines are visible, supported by a pole standing on the left side of the tracks in the mid-ground.

As the train moves forward, the power line support pole and overhead wires recede towards the upper-left and exit the frame. The snowy forested landscape on both sides continuously scrolls past, revealing new sections of winter trees and ground to the left and right of the tracks. A small, dark wooden utility structure gradually appears on the left side of the tracks, initially in the mid-distance and moving closer towards the mid-left as the train progresses.

In the first frame, the viewer looks forward down a set of snow-covered train tracks that curve gently to the right in the distance. To the left, a snow-covered embankment rises, leading to a dense forest of snow-dusted coniferous and deciduous trees. A utility pole with overhead wires is positioned to the left of the tracks in the mid-ground, with a small dark box structure at its base. To the far right, beyond the tracks, is a snow-covered field with scattered trees and distant structures under an overcast sky.

As the scene progresses, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the tracks. The initial utility pole and box structure on the left move past and out of view, while new sections of the snowy forest on the left and fields on the right are continuously revealed. Further along the tracks to the right, a yellow signal light appears, and a red building with a white roof becomes more distinct in the distant background.
