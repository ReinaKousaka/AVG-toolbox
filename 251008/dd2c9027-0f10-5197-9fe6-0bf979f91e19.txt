The first frame presents a picturesque mountain scene with a paved path curving from the viewer's right foreground, bordered by a grassy area and wooden fence on the left containing two bushy trees. Behind this, a cemetery or park lies on the left, leading to a white church spire and other buildings in the midground, while a small building is visible to the path's right. Majestic, forested mountains with rocky cliffs rise in the background under a bright blue, cloud-dotted sky.

The camera then subtly pans to the left, slightly widening the view of the valley. As the pan continues, a group of people emerges and walks along the paved path from the viewer's left, moving towards the right side of the frame.
