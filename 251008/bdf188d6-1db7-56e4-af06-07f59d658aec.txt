The first frame displays a wet, asphalt road sloping uphill, marked by yellow lines and a manhole cover in the foreground. To the viewer's left, a black and yellow striped pole stands beside a metal railing overlooking green foliage and distant mountains. On the right, a building with horizontal wooden planks features a small garden, a dark doorway, and a white garage door, with a light-colored van parked further up the road.
end of description
The light-colored van, initially stationary in the background on the uphill road, begins to move towards the viewer. It steadily descends the road, becoming larger and more clearly visible as it approaches the midground. The van's front, including its license plate and active windshield wipers, becomes prominent as it continues its descent towards the viewer's position.
