In the first frame, a woman holding a white umbrella and a light-colored bag is positioned in the left foreground, walking rightward along a wet sidewalk. To her left, a lush green hedge borders a wooded area extending into the background. On the right, a black and yellow striped barrier with a dark roof stands next to a metal fence, beyond which a wet road accommodates several cars with headlights on, receding into the background.

The woman with the umbrella continues walking along the sidewalk, moving deeper into the scene before exiting the frame to the left. The cars on the wet road in the background gradually shift, and a red bus becomes visible further down the road to the right. The consistent rainfall continues throughout the scene, visibly wetting all surfaces.

The first frame depicts a rainy street scene. To the immediate right, a dark pole with yellow and black hazard stripes is partially visible. A wet sidewalk extends forward in the mid-ground, flanked by a main road with moving cars on the right (a white sedan and SUV with headlights on) and a long hedge of green bushes on the left. A lush green hillside with trees dominates the background on the left, while distant buildings are faintly visible through the mist on the right.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the heavy rain persists. The white sedan and SUV slowly advance along the wet road. A red and white bus, displaying the number '1000', gradually emerges from the right side of the frame, moving forward past the other vehicles relative to the stationary viewpoint.

In the first frame, a rainy street scene unfolds with a wet sidewalk and lush green bushes on the left, leading into the distance. Above the bushes are tall green trees, dripping rain. A utility pole stands in the midground to the right of the sidewalk. On the wet road, several cars are stopped: a white sedan prominently in the center, a white SUV to its right, and a white van behind the sedan. Further right, a red and white bus (route 1000) is visible, with distant buildings and trees through the haze.

As the frames progress, the falling rain remains constant, making surfaces appear wetter with small ripples. The white sedan and the white SUV in the midground gradually move forward relative to the viewer's position. This movement increasingly reveals a black metal guardrail positioned on the far side of the utility pole, previously partially obscured by the white van. The red and white bus also moves forward on the right side of the frame.
