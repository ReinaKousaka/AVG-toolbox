The first frame shows a snow-covered winter landscape with a person in a black jacket and white mask walking towards the viewer in the foreground-left, along a snowy path. To the path's right lies a frozen lake with stone barriers, while traditional Korean buildings and numerous trees, including one with reddish-brown foliage, are visible in the midground and background. A large rocky mountain peak dominates the upper-left background under a clear blue sky.

As the frames progress, the person initially in the foreground walks past the viewer's original position, exiting to the left. Concurrently, other individuals on the path behind them move closer towards the viewer from the midground, with additional people entering the scene from the far left of the original viewpoint. The group of people originally walking away in the midground continues to recede further down the path.

In the first frame, a snow-covered path leads from the immediate foreground into the distance. To the far left, a person's dark-clad arm and shoulder are partially visible. A person in a dark blue hooded jacket walks towards the viewer on the path, positioned left of center. Further down the path, two individuals walk away from the viewer, and several bare trees line the right side of the path, along with large stone blocks. To the far right, a frozen, snow-covered body of water is visible. In the background, traditional Korean-style buildings with dark roofs are nestled among trees to the right, while a large, rocky mountain peak dominates the upper-left background under a bright blue sky.

The person in the dark blue hooded jacket walks from the center-left, passing the viewer and exiting the frame to the far left. Simultaneously, the two individuals in the midground continue their walk further down the snow-covered path, gradually moving deeper into the scene from the first-frame viewpoint. Other figures in the distance also progress along the path.
