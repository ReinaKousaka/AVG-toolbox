In the first frame, a wide street with tram tracks in the foreground occupies the bottom portion, leading towards a large crowd of pedestrians on the sidewalk. To the right, a grand, light-colored stone building with ornate windows and a central arched entrance dominates the midground and background. In the immediate foreground, several people are walking; a woman in a red top and a woman in a brown top move towards the left, while a man in an orange hat and a man in a white shirt walk towards the right.

As the video progresses, the individuals in the foreground continue to walk past the viewer, with the woman in the red top and the man in the orange hat moving further along their respective paths. The large group of pedestrians on the sidewalk beside the building also continuously progresses from left to right. No new objects or scenes are revealed; instead, the dynamic changes consist solely of the continuous movement of people through the established urban environment.
