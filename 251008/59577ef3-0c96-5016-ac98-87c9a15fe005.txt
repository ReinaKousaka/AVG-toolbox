A person holding a bright teal umbrella walks left to right across a wet city crosswalk in the foreground, with steam rising from a grate nearby. To the left, a building featuring "claire's" and "CAVA" signs stands below a traffic light, while cars move away from the viewer on the right side of the street, flanked by tall city buildings receding into the hazy background. end of description.
The person with the umbrella continues to move right, gradually exiting the frame. Concurrently, vehicles in the midground progress further down the street away from the viewer, while steam from the grate in the foreground subtly fluctuates. Other pedestrians also appear, crossing the street from the left in the midground.
