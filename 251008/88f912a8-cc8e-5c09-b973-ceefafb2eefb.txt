The first frame presents a wide street view with a large, multi-story beige building on the left, adorned with signs for Macy's and H&M, partially hidden by blue and yellow construction barriers in the lower left foreground. Two traffic light poles with active signals (amber on the central one, green on the left for pedestrians/turns) stand in the midground, while a tree-lined sidewalk with decorative lampposts and hanging baskets extends along the right. People are visible walking on both sidewalks, and distant buildings line the street under a bright blue sky. end of description. The viewpoint moves steadily forward along the street; the construction barriers on the left recede and move out of view, revealing more of the large building's facade, including a "PROGRES" sign. Simultaneously, the left pedestrian traffic light changes from green to amber, then red, as elements on the right sidewalk also recede, making the street ahead and more distant structures increasingly visible.
