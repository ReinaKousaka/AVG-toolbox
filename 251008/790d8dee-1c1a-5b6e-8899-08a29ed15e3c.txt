The first frame displays a street scene with buildings lining both sides under a bright blue sky. On the left, green foliage partially obscures the foreground, followed by a building with outdoor racks of colorful clothes and a bare tree above. To the right, a modern glass-fronted building with a 'LYFT' sign prominently features mannequins inside its reflective windows. The street extends into the distance, populated by a few pedestrians.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the street. Concurrently, a person on the left sidewalk, initially near the clothing racks, walks further down the sidewalk relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame presents a city street extending forward, lined with multi-story buildings under a clear blue sky. On the left, a store displays clothing through a large window and on outdoor racks, with a person walking on the adjacent sidewalk, while a bare tree branch is visible above. To the viewer's right, another building features storefronts with mannequins and a vertical "LYFT" banner.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the person on the left sidewalk continues to walk further into the distance along the street, progressively moving past the clothing racks to the right of their initial position, while the surrounding urban environment remains largely unchanged.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a vibrant street scene with a clear blue sky overhead. To the left, a broad sidewalk features multiple clothing racks displaying various garments directly in front of a storefront marked "OGG" on a building with large display windows. A person in dark attire walks from left to right across this sidewalk, positioned left of the frame's center. An asphalt street occupies the central area, receding into the background. On the right, a darker sidewalk borders a building displaying a vertical "LYFT" sign. Further down the street on the left, a building with a prominent green "CHICAGO" sign is visible, with several pedestrians scattered on both sidewalks in the midground and background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the street. The person on the left sidewalk continues walking away from the viewer and further towards the viewer's left, covering more distance relative to their initial position. Consequently, the clothing racks and the "OGG" storefront on the left shift further to the viewer's left and slightly behind the initial first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the "CHICAGO" sign and the street ahead appear closer, indicating the viewer's continuous advancement into the scene from the first frame's perspective.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The viewer observes a city street under a clear blue sky, looking forward along the road. To the immediate left, a building with a large display window showcases colorful apparel, with clothing racks extending onto the sidewalk where a person walks away from the viewer. Further down the left, a "CHICAGO" sign is prominent amidst greenery, followed by more buildings lining the receding street. On the right, a brick and wooden facade building borders a narrower sidewalk.
end of description
The primary dynamic change involves the pedestrian on the left sidewalk, who continuously moves away from the first-frame viewpoint, progressing further down the street. This person recedes past the "CHICAGO" sign and into the midground, becoming smaller as they move towards the other distant pedestrians. The overall street scene and buildings remain static relative to the viewer's fixed position.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts an urban street scene under a clear blue sky, with buildings lining both sides. To the left, a store displays clothing in windows and on external racks, alongside a planter and a "CHICAGO" sign, where a person walks along the sidewalk away from the viewer. On the right, a darker building flanks a narrow sidewalk with another person moving into the distance.
end of description
Subsequently, the person on the left moves further right and out of view, while the individual on the right continues walking deeper into the scene. A new person, carrying a large red object, emerges from the left mid-ground and proceeds towards the street's center, moving away from the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows the viewer on a street extending into the distance under a clear blue sky. To the left, a building with storefronts, notably "CHICAGO," features green foliage and a sidewalk with a low planter box where a person is partially visible near the left edge. To the right, a white wall runs alongside the viewer, with another building and a standing person visible further back towards the right edge. In the mid-ground, two individuals walk towards the viewer on the street, one carrying a prominent red object.
end of description
The two individuals walking on the street continue to approach the viewer, passing to the viewer's left and right sides respectively, with the red object no longer visible on the person as they move past. Simultaneously, a bicycle and another person standing beside it become fully visible further down the left sidewalk, previously obscured by the planter. The person initially partially visible near the left edge becomes clearer, and a small white dog briefly appears further down the street, moving away from the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a street with buildings, a blue sky, and two individuals in the foreground: one on a skateboard and another walking, both moving left and slightly away from the viewer. A stone wall and a brown building are to the left, while a white wall and a mannequin in a black hoodie are to the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, both individuals in the foreground move further left and out of the scene, revealing more of the shops and a bicycle on the left side. The skateboarder completely exits the frame to the left, followed shortly by the walker, while the mannequin on the right remains stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
