frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a street scene with the rear of a dark grey Peugeot van in the immediate right foreground, parked alongside a sidewalk where a pedestrian walks away from the viewer. To its left, a grey delivery van with green graphics drives away on tram tracks, while a line of parked cars extends into the midground, with apartment buildings on the left and a treed embankment on the right background.
end of description
From the fixed first-frame viewpoint, the dark grey Peugeot van moves right and eventually out of sight, progressively revealing a white parked car that moves into the right foreground. Simultaneously, both the pedestrian on the sidewalk and the grey delivery van on the tram tracks continue to move further away down the street.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a street scene with a white station wagon partially occupying the immediate foreground to the viewer's right. To the left, tram tracks run alongside parked cars, while a line of parked vehicles, including a red hatchback and a white van, extends along the right side of the road into the distance. Buildings flank both sides of the street, with a delivery van positioned centrally further down the road.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the white station wagon to the immediate right to shift out of view. This action reveals more of the red hatchback, which was parked behind it, and it subsequently becomes prominent in the right foreground, with the white van further behind it also becoming more visible to the right.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a street scene is visible under a clear blue sky. To the immediate right foreground is the rear of a light-colored station wagon, with a red sedan parked directly ahead of it. Further ahead on the right, a white delivery van with "VIAFIN GAS" branding is parked, followed by other cars and a multi-story building, with a grassy, tree-covered hill on the far right. To the left, tram tracks run down the street, paralleled by a row of parked cars and a tall, modern white building. In the far distance, a green vehicle is moving away, centered on the street.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the light-colored wagon car in the immediate right foreground progressively moves out of frame to the right. The red car and the white VIAFIN GAS van, previously positioned ahead and to the right of the wagon car, become more prominent and move closer to the viewer. Simultaneously, the parked cars on the left and the modern building move closer and then out of frame to the left, revealing more of the street ahead. The distant green vehicle continues to recede further down the street.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a street scene with a white van partially visible in the immediate foreground to the right of the viewer. Adjacent to it, a red car is parked, behind which a street sign and a multi-story building are situated, with a grassy slope and trees further to the right. To the left, tram tracks run down the center of the street, bordered by parked cars and a large, modern building on the far left. In the distance, more buildings line the street under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The white van proceeds to move out of the frame to the right, followed by the red car, which also exits to the right, revealing the sidewalk and street where they were previously parked. Subsequently, a person becomes visible walking away on the newly revealed sidewalk area to the mid-right, past the "no parking" sign. Simultaneously, a yellow bus moves further away down the street in the distant center.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a city street with tram tracks extending into the distance from the foreground. Tall buildings line the left side, while a multi-story gray building, a grassy slope, and a sidewalk with a street sign and a person stand on the right.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the person on the right side of the street walks away from the viewer and further to the right, gradually exiting the frame entirely, while the vehicles visible in the distance remain mostly stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a city street with tram tracks extending into the distance from the foreground, flanked by a modern white building on the left and a grey multi-story building with a grassy bank on the right. Two cars are positioned in the midground, heading away from the viewer, while a partially obscured green tram is visible further down the road, approaching the viewpoint.
end of description
As the frames progress, the green tram steadily moves closer to the first-frame viewpoint, becoming fully visible in the center-left lane of the road while passing the largely stationary cars.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a city street viewed from a slight elevation, looking forward along tram tracks that converge towards the center. To the left, a modern light-colored building stands beside a glass tram stop shelter, beyond which a large red-brick building with trees is visible. Ahead, a green tram and a dark car are positioned on the tracks, with a silver car parked to their right. On the right, a multi-story building with ground-level shops lines the street, displaying a pedestrian crossing sign and a no-stopping sign, alongside yellow construction barriers near the foreground corner.
end of description
The green tram and the dark car, initially seen forward on the tracks, progressively move further away from the first-frame viewpoint, eventually receding out of sight. The silver car remains stationary in its forward-right position. Simultaneously, the camera subtly shifts forward, causing objects on the right, such as the pedestrian crossing sign and the yellow barriers, to appear incrementally closer to the viewer's original position.
