The first frame presents a city street looking forward, flanked by multi-story buildings and an overcast sky. Parked cars and pedestrians occupy sidewalks on both sides, with a white car on the left foreground and a black car on the right beneath a 'FLATS TO LET' banner, while distant skyscrapers, including one labeled 'TRANSNET,' dominate the horizon.

As the viewer moves forward, the initial white car on the left and the black car on the right exit the frame to their respective sides, while a blue car appears on the left and moves ahead. Other parked vehicles and pedestrians gradually move into and out of the scene, revealing more of the road and buildings further down the street.
