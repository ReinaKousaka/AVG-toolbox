In the first frame, a night street scene is depicted from a pedestrian's perspective. In the immediate left foreground, a person in a dark coat, blurred, is seen walking away. Along the left sidewalk, a group of masked pedestrians walk towards the viewer past illuminated storefronts, including "VENETA OTTICA." The midground features a cobblestone street with tram tracks leading into the distance, occupied by a distant vehicle and a prominent lamppost. On the right sidewalk, more pedestrians are visible near other storefronts, one displaying a McDonald's sign. Buildings line both sides of the street, illuminated by streetlights under a dark sky.

As the frames progress, the blurred person in the left foreground moves out of view. The pedestrians on the left sidewalk, including one in a white coat carrying striped bags, walk towards and then past the viewer to the left. Concurrently, a cyclist on a white bicycle and a light-colored car appear on the street, moving from the background towards and past the viewer on the right side. A scooter with a rider then follows the car, also passing on the right. Additional pedestrians continually emerge and move along the left sidewalk, maintaining a steady flow of people towards and past the viewer.

In the first frame, the viewer observes a busy city street at night. Two partial figures are visible in the immediate foreground: one on the bottom left and another on the bottom right, both with their backs largely to the viewer. A streetlight pole stands slightly right of center in the mid-foreground, separating the paved sidewalk on the left from the street on the right. The left sidewalk is lined with brightly lit shop windows and several pedestrians walking away from the viewer, prominently featuring two large white banners with eyeglasses near the left edge. The street on the right, equipped with tram tracks, shows a white car moving away from the viewer and a yellow tram approaching in the mid-distance, all flanked by multi-story buildings.
end of description
The partial figures in the immediate foreground, to the left and right, gradually move out of frame, revealing more of the pavement and the streetlight pole previously obscured. Simultaneously, the white car on the mid-right continues to recede further down the street while the yellow tram approaches the viewpoint, becoming larger and more distinct. Pedestrians on the left sidewalk consistently move further away from the viewer, with new figures appearing from behind the initial left foreground person's position and also proceeding away. Additionally, a new individual on a small motorcycle emerges on the far right side of the street, also moving away from the viewer.

A night city street features a person by a lit storefront and white banner on the left, a wide sidewalk with pedestrians receding into the distance, and a street with tram tracks on the right where a tram with bright headlights approaches beyond a utility pole. Buildings line both sides of the bustling, illuminated street.
end of description
As frames progress, the person on the far left slowly turns and raises a hand towards the storefront. Concurrently, the tram on the right steadily moves closer to the viewer, becoming more prominent, while pedestrians on the sidewalk continue walking away into the distance.
