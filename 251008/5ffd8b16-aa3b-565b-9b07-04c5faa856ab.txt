The first frame shows a bustling city street where, on the left, a red and white "COVID-19 TESTING" tent partially obscures a white van, with a person seated at a table. To the right, a wide sidewalk bordered by a building with white fluted columns and red arched entrances leads into the distance, with pedestrians walking away from the viewer along the thoroughfare lined with tall city buildings and traffic.

As the camera subtly moves forward and slightly to the right, the person under the tent on the left exits the frame, and the white van reveals "FedEx" branding as it moves forward slightly. The pedestrians on the sidewalk continue walking further into the distance, while the red doorways on the right building become more visible, revealing some blue tape on them.

The first frame captures a bustling city street scene. A man in a gray shirt walks towards the viewer on the left sidewalk in the foreground, while a woman in a white top walks away from the viewer on the right midground sidewalk, passing a building with white columns and a 'La Ropa' sign. The street, running parallel to the viewer, is lined with traffic, including a FedEx truck on the left, and tall buildings receding into the distant background.

As frames progress, the man quickly exits the frame to the viewer's immediate left. Concurrently, the woman moves further away along the right sidewalk, revealing more of the storefront's exterior, including a mannequin in a display window and graffiti, as the viewer's perspective slightly advances.

In the first frame, a wide city street stretches into the distance under a clear sky, flanked by a sidewalk on the right and a road on the left, both receding from the viewer's immediate foreground. On the right, a concrete sidewalk features a manhole cover, then a person walking away from the viewer past a store with a prominent red 'La Ropa' sign (featuring red lips) and a mannequin visible inside, with a wooden bench near the entrance. On the left, the street contains multiple vehicles, including white vans and a silver sedan, a fire hydrant, and red-brick buildings lining the thoroughfare.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily moves forward along the sidewalk, causing the pedestrian to recede further ahead and revealing more of the storefronts to the right and street details further down the block, relative to the initial frame's position. A sign featuring a green cannabis leaf, initially to the left of the 'La Ropa' store entrance, becomes more centrally located in the advancing viewpoint. Concurrently, the white van previously on the far left advances further ahead along the street.
