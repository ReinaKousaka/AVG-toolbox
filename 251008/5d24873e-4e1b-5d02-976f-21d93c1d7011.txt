The first frame displays a wet city street at night, featuring a crosswalk in the immediate foreground. A white car with headlights approaches centrally in the mid-ground, flanked by parked white cars on the left and right, against a background of illuminated buildings and streetlights lining a long, wet road. end of description. Subsequently, the central white car continuously approaches the viewer, growing larger and casting increasingly bright reflections on the wet pavement. Visible raindrops create splashes around the car, and a 'Rain Everyday' logo emerges in the bottom-left corner.

The first frame presents a rainy city street at night, seen from a crosswalk in the foreground. A white car with illuminated headlights is approaching the viewer slightly right of center, while buildings with various lights line the wet, reflective road that recedes into the dark background.
end of description
As frames progress, the white car moves closer, splashing water on the street before veering slightly left and continuing past the viewer. A white arrow road marking on the asphalt becomes fully visible to the right of the car's path. Rain continues to fall, creating dynamic reflections and movement across the wet street surface.

A wide, wet asphalt road stretches directly ahead from the viewer, marked by a crosswalk in the immediate foreground. To the viewer's left, a white car with illuminated headlights is stopped at the crosswalk, facing towards the viewer, with buildings and streetlights lining the distant left side. To the viewer's right, a white car is parked along the curb, facing away, with more illuminated buildings and streetlights lining the distant right side. The entire scene is dark, suggesting nighttime, with numerous bright reflections from lights on the glistening wet road.
end of description
As the frames progress, yellow double lines and a '60' speed limit marking appear on the road just past the crosswalk, central to the viewer. The white car on the left moves forward and slightly to the right, passing the crosswalk and driving away from the viewer. Simultaneously, another white car becomes more visible to the far right, also moving away from the viewer, while other distant cars on the left lane also begin to move forward. The road remains wet and reflective throughout these changes.
