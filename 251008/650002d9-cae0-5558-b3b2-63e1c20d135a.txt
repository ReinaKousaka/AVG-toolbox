The first frame shows a bustling street scene lined with buildings under an overcast sky. To the immediate left, a food stall with a red awning and glowing red lamps is prominent, with a person in a white and red patterned jacket and mask standing facing it. Further down the street on the left, more small shops with red awnings are visible. On the right, buildings with diverse facades and red steps leading to entrances line the street, with a partial view of a scooter in the lower right foreground. In the mid-ground, a van and several pedestrians move along the street, which extends into the background where more distant buildings rise.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the person on the left exits the frame, and the initial food stall progressively moves out of view to the left, revealing more of the sidewalk and additional shops along the left side of the street, including one with red lanterns. The street ahead of the viewer lengthens, showing more distant pedestrian and vehicle traffic, while the buildings and shops on the right, including the red steps and neon signs, gradually shift further into the background relative to the initial viewpoint.
