The first frame captures a paved path stretching into the distance, framed by white-blossomed cherry trees forming a natural archway. To the left foreground stands a street lamp, with a grassy area and distant trees visible beyond green bushes. A group of people walks away from the viewer on the path, which features dappled shadows under a bright blue sky.
end of description
In the following frames, the group of people continues to walk further away from the viewer along the path, progressively becoming smaller in the frame as they move deeper into the scene. There are no newly revealed objects or changes to the surrounding environment; only the people's movement demonstrates dynamic change.
