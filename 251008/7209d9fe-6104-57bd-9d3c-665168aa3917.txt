The first frame depicts a narrow city street extending into the distance under a blue sky, lined with tall buildings featuring numerous windows and shutters. In the immediate foreground, blue and yellow construction barriers enclose excavated ground on both sides, while an old building with palm trees stands left and shops with signs like 'LXH' and traffic signs appear on the right.
end of description
As the viewpoint gradually moves forward along the street, the foreground barriers recede from the bottom corners, and a white pedestrian crosswalk becomes visible on the ground directly in front. Additionally, two electric scooters parked on the right sidewalk become clearer and closer to the viewer's advancing position.

The first frame displays a narrow city street receding into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings; a light brown building with columns and a prominent palm tree in a planter stands to the left, while a lighter beige building with storefronts and various signs (including a blue bicycle/person, a red truck, and a black 'LXH' sign) occupies the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly recedes. The red truck sign on the right moves slightly higher within the frame, and its adjacent black 'LXH' sign is replaced by a 'CHICOULON CAVE & VIN' sign, both remaining on the right building facade. Concurrently, the pink scooter on the right sidewalk moves further away, and several people walking in the mid-ground continue further down the street, receding into the distance relative to the initial viewpoint.

The first frame presents a narrow city street lined with tall, light-colored buildings receding towards a bright horizon under a blue sky, featuring a palm tree in a planter on the left and various storefronts, bollards, and a "CHICOULON" sign on the right. end of description
Progressively, a person on a white scooter moves towards the viewer from the mid-ground along the paved path, while a group of pedestrians also approaches from further down the right side of the street. As they draw nearer, the palm tree on the left becomes more prominent and a colorful, intricate hanging decoration appears on the right building's facade above the stores.

In the first frame, a narrow street extends into the distance under a clear sky, flanked by multi-story buildings with various windows and balconies. To the immediate left, a blue and white barrier system is visible, with a palm frond in the far foreground. On the right, a black scooter is parked on the sidewalk, with two women walking towards the viewer and a man standing next to the scooter. Further down the street, a white scooter with a person on it is moving away from the viewer.
end of description
Over subsequent frames, the two women on the right sidewalk continuously walk towards the viewer, progressively moving past the parked black scooter and then out of the frame to the viewer's immediate right. Concurrently, the man previously standing near the black scooter also shifts his position, moving slightly closer to the viewer before remaining largely stationary. Meanwhile, the white scooter on the street travels further into the distance, away from the viewer.
