In the foreground left, three individuals stand under an umbrella, facing away from the viewer, near a wet paved street. To their right, in the midground, a person holding a bright yellow umbrella walks away from the viewer on a reflective sidewalk. The street itself, positioned centrally, is wet and reflects various city lights, showing a silver car moving left of center, and a green bus further back on the road. On the far left, a blue bus is partially visible. To the right of the central sidewalk, a white car is parked near a modern building with large glass windows and illuminated signs. The background shows a blurry city scene with more lights, buildings, and trees under a dark, rainy sky.

The person with the yellow umbrella continues walking further away from the viewer along the sidewalk. Concurrently, the silver car on the left drives forward, and the green bus also moves further into the distance. Subsequently, the blue bus on the far left also proceeds forward, eventually revealing a red car that then appears to move towards the viewer before also progressing away from the viewpoint.

In the first frame, a person holding a bright yellow umbrella walks away from the viewer on a wet, illuminated city sidewalk at night, positioned centrally in the midground. To the left, a rain-slicked street reflects vehicle lights, with an orange car in the mid-left foreground, a bus further back, and other vehicles in the distance, alongside a bus stop pole. On the right, a modern building with large glass windows reflects the street lights, featuring a prominent green bottle decoration and a parked white car nearby. The background reveals more illuminated buildings and streetlights under a dark, rainy sky, with a green electronic sign across the street.

The person with the yellow umbrella steadily walks further into the midground while an orange car on the left drives forward and a blue bus moves away from the viewer. A motorcycle then emerges in the mid-left, following the moving traffic. Simultaneously, the electronic sign across the street dynamically changes its display from a time indication to a sequence of numbers and Korean text. The continuous rainfall is evident through persistent reflections on the wet street and sidewalk surfaces.

The first frame shows a wet city street at night, looking down the road away from the viewer. In the foreground, a person walks away from the viewer on the left side of a reflective sidewalk, holding a bright yellow umbrella over a blue utility cart. To their right, a white car is parked beside a modern building with large glass windows, featuring giant green bottle-shaped advertisements inside, with blue temporary barriers further to the right. On the left, a utility pole with various signs and a red digital sign displaying "12-13만원 상환" in the upper left background illuminate the scene, reflecting on the rain-soaked asphalt and brick sidewalk.

Over the subsequent frames, the man with the yellow umbrella continues walking forward, moving further down the sidewalk away from the viewer, as do the vehicles on the street. The prominent red digital sign in the upper left background undergoes a sequence of changes, first showing partial Korean text updates, then eventually displaying "27초". A manhole cover gradually becomes fully visible in the foreground on the left side of the sidewalk as the scene progresses.
