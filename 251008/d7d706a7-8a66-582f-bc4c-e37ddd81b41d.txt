end of description
As the frames advance, the traffic lights on the viewer's left transition from green to red and then back to green, while the traffic light on the right also eventually changes from red to green. The orange and blue car directly ahead, the white sedan to the left, and other vehicles further down the road all begin to move forward through the intersection. Concurrently, the group of individuals on scooters and motorcycles to the right also starts to advance into the intersection.
