The first frame shows a wet street scene under rain, featuring an asphalt road curving left bordered by a metal barrier, a green bike path, and a brown-pavered sidewalk leading to a building on the right, with prominent trees and a lamppost on the left.

Subsequently, a silver car appears on the wet road from the mid-right, moving leftward past the lamppost. This car continues to the far left and eventually exits the frame as a second, darker car emerges from a similar position behind it, also traveling left and splashing water.

The first frame presents a rainy street scene from a slightly elevated viewpoint. In the foreground, a wet two-lane road stretches from the left towards the background, bordered on the left by a silver metal barrier with yellow accents. To the right of the barrier is a wet, reddish-brown brick sidewalk, followed by a bright green-painted bike path, both receding into the mid-ground. Three prominent trees with dark trunks and lush green leaves stand along the brick sidewalk, between the road barrier and the bike path. On the far right, part of a brown multi-story building is visible, with a shaded walkway underneath. In the mid-ground on the road, a white car is partially visible moving away behind the first tree, while green foliage lines the far side of the road and the area next to the building. Tall, light-colored apartment buildings rise in the distant background, under an overcast sky.

A dark grey SUV appears from the far left in the second frame, moving rightward on the road behind the barrier, while the white car recedes further. This SUV continues moving right, passing the first tree by the third frame, as a white pickup truck emerges from the far left in the fourth frame, also moving rightward ahead of the SUV. The pickup truck then travels past the first tree and then the second tree on the road, moving away from the viewer. As the pickup truck exits the frame on the far right, a light-colored car becomes visible in the mid-ground, moving away behind the second tree. This car then proceeds to move further away, receding into the distant background behind the third tree.

The first frame captures a rainy urban scene from a ground-level perspective. To the viewer's immediate right is a wet, green-paved path, presumably a bike lane, adjacent to a brown brick building partially visible on the far right. To the viewer's left, a wet, brick sidewalk runs parallel, separated from a multi-lane asphalt road by a black metal fence with yellow circular accents. Several prominent trees with green foliage stand between the sidewalk and the road, with the largest in the mid-left, while a yellow-and-black curved arrow sign is visible further down the green path. In the background, dense green trees line the far side of the road, and tall, white high-rise buildings rise above the treeline on the right.

A dark SUV appears on the wet road to the far left of the foreground trees, moving rightward across the mid-ground, gradually becoming more visible as it passes the trees and travels toward the right side of the frame. It then exits the scene to the far right. Following this, a lighter-colored car proceeds along the same path in the mid-ground, also moving from left to right. A white sedan subsequently emerges from the far left of the road, behind the fence and the first tree, also progressing rightward. In the latter frames, a "Rain Everyday" watermark is revealed in the bottom-left corner of the view.
