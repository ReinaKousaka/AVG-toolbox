The first frame presents an aerial view of a rugged landscape entirely covered by winding, irregular gray stone walls that segment the terrain into various plots. Interspersed within and between these walls are patches of green and brown vegetation, including numerous small trees and scrub, with some foliage exhibiting hints of red and yellow, suggesting autumn colors, all spread across the ground directly below the viewer.
