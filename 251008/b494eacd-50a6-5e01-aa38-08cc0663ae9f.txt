A narrow, rocky dirt path extends from the viewer's immediate foreground into the distant center, slightly curving left. To the viewer's left, a steep, green embankment is densely covered in ferns and foliage, with a dark log resting horizontally upon it in the mid-left. To the viewer's right, a small stream flows over dark, moss-covered rocks. Dense, bright green trees and undergrowth fill the middle ground and background, framing the path and stream, with a prominent leafy tree standing mid-right.
end of description
The camera progresses forward along the path, causing the log on the left embankment to move closer to the viewer and eventually out of the left frame. The stream and its mossy rocks, originally to the viewer's right, also move past the viewer and recede into the background right. The dense foliage and trees that were further ahead in the first frame progressively come closer, revealing new sections of the winding path and forest interior.
