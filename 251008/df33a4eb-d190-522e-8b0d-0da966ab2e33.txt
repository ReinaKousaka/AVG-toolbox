A cobbled street, paved with small stones, leads uphill into the distance, bordered by buildings on both sides. To the immediate left, a brick building features a prominent green double door with an ornate white frame, alongside a barred window. Further along the left side, another section of the brick building displays additional windows and a set of mailboxes, while on the right, a light yellow building with multiple windows and balconies is visible, fronted by green shrubbery.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly moves forward and slightly to the left, causing the green door and the brick building to appear progressively closer and larger in the frame. Concurrently, the three black mailboxes on the left building become more distinctly visible. The sun's glare in the upper right corner also intensifies slightly with the shift in perspective.

The first frame captures a narrow, cobbled street ascending uphill, flanked by buildings. To the viewer's immediate left, a brick building features a dark green arched doorway, partially visible, followed by a window with an ornate metal grille and three black mailboxes mounted below, labeled with the number '27' above them. To the right, a pale yellow building with light blue window shutters and a balcony stands, with a sloped area of green hedges bordering the street. A bright blue sky with sun glare is visible in the upper right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily moves forward along the cobbled street. The ornate green doorway on the far left recedes and becomes largely cut off from view. Simultaneously, the brick wall on the left, including the window with its grille and the three mailboxes, becomes more prominent and fills a larger portion of the frame as the viewer approaches them. The number '27' on this wall becomes notably clearer, and the cobbled street extends further into the immediate foreground.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a narrow, uphill cobblestone street under a bright blue sky with sun glare emanating from the upper right. To the viewer's immediate left, a brick building features a barred window and a doorway, while to the right, a light yellow building displays multiple windows with white shutters and a prominent balcony, situated above a green bush-covered embankment. end of description.
As the frames progress, the viewpoint gradually moves forward along the cobblestone street. A small, round red object becomes visible on the upper left facade of the brick building, slightly further along its length relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the yellow building on the right subtly recedes as the viewer advances, revealing more of its lower structure and the adjacent embankment.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame reveals a cobblestone street ascending between buildings. A brick structure with a grated window and a red circular fixture stands on the left, while a light yellow building with white-shuttered windows and a balcony occupies the right. A red circular sign is visible further up the narrow passage in the middle distance.
end of description
The viewpoint continuously moves forward, up the street. Both the brick building on the left and the yellow building on the right gradually recede from view as the red circular sign and the narrow passage ahead grow larger and closer to the viewer. This progression indicates forward movement through the scene.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a narrow, uphill cobblestone street flanked by old buildings. To the viewer's immediate left is a brick and stucco building with a barred window in the foreground, followed by a lighter-colored building featuring two weathered red wooden doors and an ornate black lamppost extending towards the center. On the viewer's right stands a pale yellow building with a stone foundation, displaying two windows with white louvered shutters, a small balcony with black railings, and a lower window. In the distance, at the end of the sloping street, another building is visible, and a red circular 'no entry' sign hangs high near the center-right.

end of description

The camera steadily moves forward and slightly to the right, advancing up the cobblestone street. As the viewpoint shifts deeper into the alley, the buildings on both sides recede, revealing more of the street's uphill incline. The barred window on the left and the lower right windows move further out of frame, while a numerical address "28" becomes fully visible on the left building, previously partially obscured. A dark car, previously mostly obscured, becomes more clearly identifiable at the far end of the street, still ahead of the original viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a narrow, uphill cobblestone street, flanked by buildings. To the viewer's left is a peach-colored building with a dark red door labeled '28' and an attached mailbox, while a yellow building with shuttered windows stands on the right. A black lamppost and a red prohibitory sign hang overhead in the midground, with a blue car visible further up the street between the buildings.
end of description
The viewpoint then steadily moves forward and slightly uphill relative to the first-frame viewpoint; consequently, the visible street number on the left building changes from '28' to '29', revealing more of the path and distant buildings ahead.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a narrow, cobbled alleyway flanked by buildings; a two-toned wall with a dark door and "29" is immediately to the viewer's left, while a plain yellow wall with light blue window shutters is on the right. In the distance, further down the alley, a brick-colored building is visible with a dark blue car parked to its left and a small white and orange car to its right, all beneath an open sky, while a red circular sign hangs high above the alley closer to the viewer.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward into the alley; the "29" plaque and the door on the left wall move out of frame to the left, and the red circular sign recedes upwards and out of view. Consequently, the previously distant dark blue and white/orange cars, along with the brick building at the alley's end, appear larger and more detailed as they are approached.
