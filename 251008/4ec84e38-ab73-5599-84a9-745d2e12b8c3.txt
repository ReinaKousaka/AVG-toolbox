In the first frame, a low stone wall curves along the lower right, with green grass and bushes behind it. A tall vertical pole stands prominently in the mid-right, partially obscuring a wooden sign for "Sunstar" and a large evergreen tree directly behind it. To the left, a paved road extends into the distance, flanked by several traditional multi-story Swiss buildings with balconies and pitched roofs, where people are visible on sidewalks and outdoor seating. Towering mountains loom in the distant background under a sky with scattered white clouds.

As the view progresses, the camera moves forward, causing the Sunstar sign and the large evergreen tree on the right to gradually recede and move out of the first-frame's right edge. The paved road and the traditional Swiss buildings on the left side of the frame become more prominent, revealing greater detail and extending further into the distance. Concurrently, the towering mountains in the background appear clearer and more expansive, becoming less obscured by the receding foreground elements. A person in a white top emerges on the path to the right of the road, walking directly towards the initial viewpoint's position.

The first frame presents a street scene with a low stone wall bordering a grassy incline on the right, backed by trees and a modern building. To the left, a paved road and sidewalk are flanked by traditional chalet-style buildings, notably 'HOTEL TE POST' with outdoor seating. A majestic mountain dominates the distant background under a partly cloudy sky.

A person on a scooter emerges from the mid-left on the sidewalk, moving forward past the buildings and towards the viewer, eventually passing directly to the viewer's left. Following this, a white car appears on the road from the mid-left, driving towards and then past the viewer to the left.
