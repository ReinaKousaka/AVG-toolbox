In the first frame, a person in a green jacket, dark cap, and black and orange backpack stands with their back to the viewer in the left-center foreground, looking towards a snow-covered frozen lake. To their right, a partially visible person in a white top and dark skirt also looks towards the lake. Centered in the mid-ground, across the frozen lake, is an ornate, multi-tiered Korean pavilion on a small, snow-covered island, surrounded by bare trees. Traditional buildings are partially visible further to the left beyond the lake, all under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The person in the green jacket and backpack moves to the right, gradually revealing more of the frozen lake and the pavilion on the island, which were previously partially obscured by them. Concurrently, the person in the hanbok also shifts right and exits the frame, uncovering more of the lake's right side. As these foreground figures depart, the white arched bridge connecting to the pavilion and the traditional buildings on the far left of the lake become fully visible. The scene fully opens, centrally showcasing the majestic pavilion on its snow-covered island within the expansive frozen lake, now completely unobscured from the first-frame viewpoint.
