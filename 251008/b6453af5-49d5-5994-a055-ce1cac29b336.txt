In the first frame, a person in a blue suit and mask is in the near foreground left, while another in a black leather jacket and mask stands mid-foreground left, both looking at phones. To their right, a tree trunk separates a busy street on the far left from a sidewalk filled with pedestrians walking away from the viewer, flanked by a brightly lit building on the right.

Subsequently, the viewer moves forward along the sidewalk; the two foreground people exit the frame to the left, and the tree passes to the viewer's left, revealing more of the street. A black taxi appears on the street to the left, moving away, as the pedestrians on the sidewalk continue forward relative to the viewer's advancing position.

A large tree trunk fills the immediate left foreground, beside a black metal railing separating the sidewalk from a street with distant cars and buildings on the far left. On the right, numerous pedestrians walk away from the viewer on a well-lit sidewalk, bordered by a brightly lit building featuring large advertising screens and stacks of rolled items along its facade. A phone booth-like structure is visible further back on the left, behind the tree.
end of description.
As the viewer moves forward, the tree trunk and railing recede and gradually exit the left side of the frame. The phone booth-like structure passes to the viewer's left, revealing more of the sidewalk and distant buildings. The pedestrians continue moving ahead, and near the final frames, a man in a dark suit with a backpack enters the frame from the right, moving closer to the viewer.
