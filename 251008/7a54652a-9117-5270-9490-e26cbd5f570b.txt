The first frame captures a narrow, old alleyway with a mix of worn stone and plaster walls. To the viewer's left, a flight of stone steps ascends diagonally upwards, accompanied by a green metal handrail, with potted plants displaying red and yellow flowers situated at its base. Directly ahead, an arched stone passageway recedes into the distance, through which a bright area is visible, revealing a person walking away from the viewer in the background.
end of description
The camera slowly moves forward, entering the arched passageway. The person previously visible in the distance ahead of the viewer moves further away and eventually disappears deeper within the scene. Concurrently, the stone steps and potted plants on the viewer's immediate left from the first frame gradually recede out of view as the perspective shifts deeper into the tunnel.

The viewer is positioned at the entrance of a narrow, weathered stone archway or tunnel. To the immediate left, a green metal handrail ascends alongside stone steps, beneath which a potted plant with red flowers is visible. The archway's interior walls, severely aged with peeling plaster, feature a small gridded window on the left further in, and a dark open doorway along with a red-framed opening on the right. The tunnel, with its worn arched ceiling, leads to a brightly lit outdoor area visible in the distance.
end of description
The viewpoint moves forward, entering the archway. The green handrail, potted plant, and stairs on the initial left quickly recede from view, moving to the left and behind the first-frame viewpoint. As the camera progresses, the tunnel's interior walls and arched ceiling become closer, moving towards and encompassing the original viewpoint. The bright street scene at the far end of the tunnel expands and appears to approach the viewer.

The first frame depicts a narrow, arched stone passage with a worn, barred window set into the left wall and a recessed, framed opening on the right, leading towards a bright, sunlit outdoor scene directly ahead in the distance.
end of description
Subsequently, the viewer moves forward through the passage; the sunlit area directly ahead expands, while the window on the left and the framed opening on the right recede past the viewer's initial position. As the progression continues, previously unseen structural details and small holes on the upper right wall are revealed further into the passage, ahead of the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The viewer is positioned at the start of a narrow, arched tunnel with a cobblestone path extending forward. Textured, peeling walls flank both sides, featuring a barred rectangular window on the left wall in the midground and an indistinct opening on the upper right wall. The tunnel opens into a brightly lit outdoor scene at its far end, revealing a street with some greenery and architecture under strong sunlight, with a dark green door visible on the left side of this exit archway.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward through the tunnel. As the camera advances towards the bright archway ahead, the barred window on the left wall gradually moves out of the frame to the viewer's left, while the previously distant outdoor scene beyond the arch expands and becomes clearer. A second dark green door emerges clearly on the right wall, closer to the exit, revealing more of the sunlit street with terraced steps and potted plants just beyond the tunnel.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows the viewer standing at the entrance of a dark, narrow arched tunnel or passageway. A cobblestone path extends forward from the viewer's position, leading towards a brightly lit opening at the end. Rough, weathered stone walls flank both the left and right sides of the viewer, converging towards the central arch. To the left, a green door is visible, while to the right, a darker opening with steps descends slightly. Beyond the arch, a sunlit open square is revealed, featuring distant buildings, potted plants, and a structure with a reddish roof on the left side of the square.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily moves forward into the tunnel. The brightly lit square and the buildings beyond the arch appear to draw closer and become slightly larger within the frame. The weathered walls flanking the viewer, along with the green door and the steps, slowly recede towards the edges of the view, indicating the viewer's continued progression through the passageway towards the sunny outdoor area.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows the viewer inside a narrow, arched stone passageway looking out into a bright, sunlit town square. Immediately to the viewer's left is a dark green double door set into a weathered wall, while to the right, a graffitied dark green door is partially visible within another weathered wall. Overhead, a curved ceiling with a round light fixture covers the passageway, which has a stone-paved floor leading towards the archway. Beyond the arch, a prominent white building with an arched wooden door stands slightly right of center, flanked by a reddish-pink building with a spire to its left and several potted plants near its base. Further left, a hillside with distant buildings is visible, and stone steps ascend to the right just outside the arch, all under a bright sky.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly advances forward and slightly to the right, moving out from under the archway. This movement reveals more of the sunlit town square ahead, making previously partially obscured colorful buildings on the right side of the square fully visible. A few people emerge into view in the open square to the right of the white church, and another person in pink appears further down the street to the left of the church, having been hidden by buildings. The scene widens, offering a broader perspective of the vibrant town square and the sky above, which were previously framed by the arch.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows the viewer looking out from beneath a stone archway into a sunlit village square. To the immediate left, a dark green wooden door is partially visible next to a textured stone wall, mostly in shadow. On the right, a low stone wall with steps extends into the square, casting a prominent shadow across the paved ground. In the midground, a cream-colored church with a reddish bell tower stands prominently, while a street curves uphill to the left, where a person in pink walks away from the viewer. To the right, a group of people are gathered near brightly colored multi-story buildings, all framed by green hills and a blue sky with white clouds in the background.

end of description
The viewpoint slowly moves forward through the archway, revealing more of the stone-paved street and the adjacent buildings. The initially shadowed wall on the left gradually enters direct sunlight, exposing more architectural details like a drainpipe as the dark green door moves out of frame. The group of people on the right remain relatively static but become clearer, while the person in pink continues walking further up the street, receding into the distance. The church and colorful buildings ahead grow slightly larger as the viewer progresses into the square.
