frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame depicts a wide paved road extending into the distance under a cloudy sky. In the foreground, slightly to the left, is a painted road island with three black and yellow striped bollards. To the far left, a metal guardrail parallels the road, beyond which lie railway tracks and a steep, tree-covered hillside. On the right, a sidewalk runs alongside a dense green hedge, behind which stands a large commercial building with exposed wooden scaffolding on its roof. Distant mountains are visible straight ahead in the background.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the three black and yellow bollards in the foreground progressively recede to the viewer's left and eventually move out of frame to the left. Concurrently, a green and yellow multi-directional road sign, initially further ahead and to the left near the railway tracks, becomes increasingly prominent and closer on the viewer's left. The commercial building on the right, initially partially obscured, gradually reveals its full lower facade, including entrances and parked vehicles, as the viewer approaches it. The white pole on the right curb moves out of frame to the viewer's right. Additionally, new yellow dashed road markings appear on the asphalt to the right of the viewer's path.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a paved road curving slightly left into the distance, flanked by a steep, treed hillside with railway tracks and a guardrail on the left. To the immediate right, a large dark gray and red building with parked cars is visible, with a blue building further along, all under a cloudy sky with distant mountains ahead.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the large building on the right gradually exits the frame to the right, revealing more of the road ahead. A street light pole and a white caravan with additional parked vehicles become visible further along the road on the right, replacing the initial building's view. Simultaneously, a red circular traffic sign emerges on the left, closer to the railway tracks.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a two-lane road extending into the distance, flanked on the left by a steep, tree-covered hillside with railway tracks, power lines, and a guardrail, and on the right by a tall streetlamp, a row of green hedges, a parking lot with a caravan and cars, and blue and green industrial buildings; distant mountains rise under a cloudy sky, with a small white car approaching on the road. end of description. As the viewer progresses forward, the streetlamp, hedges, and buildings on the right recede out of view. A grey car, initially a distant white car, approaches and then passes the viewer to the left, while two red '60' speed limit signs appear, first on the right and then another further ahead on the left.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a paved road with a central dashed white line and a left solid yellow line leading into the distance under a cloudy sky. To the left, a metal guardrail runs alongside railroad tracks, beyond which a steep, rocky, tree-covered hillside with utility poles rises. On the right, a grassy verge and sidewalk are bordered by a dense row of tall green hedges, with a lamppost and a partially visible building behind them further down the road. Distant mountains are visible straight ahead in the background.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the road markings progress towards the viewer, and the guardrail and hillside on the left become more prominent. Simultaneously, the hedge line on the right recedes, progressively revealing a dark industrial building displaying "WEW" flags and several parked cars in front of it.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a straight two-lane road receding into the distance under a cloudy sky. To the left, a steep, tree-covered mountain face parallels multiple railway tracks and an electrical line infrastructure. On the right, a sidewalk and parking lot with several vehicles lead to a large industrial building displaying 'WEW' logos on its facade and on two prominent flags.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the road, the two flags on the right retract and disappear. More cars and vans become visible in the parking lot on the right, while the building's facade gradually reveals more windows and a red circular logo replaces the 'WEW' sign. The railway tracks and mountain on the left remain relatively static but are continuously revealed as the foreground moves away.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a paved road extending into the distance from the viewer's perspective, bordered on the left by a steep, vegetated embankment featuring train tracks, overhead power lines, and a silver guardrail. To the viewer's right, a paved shoulder with dashed white lines gives way to a grassy strip, a parking lot with various cars, and large industrial buildings with blue and green facades, all beneath an overcast sky with distant mountains.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the white van initially in the parking lot to the viewer's right recedes and exits the frame, revealing more parked cars and a new street sign that emerges further ahead on the right. Simultaneously, the train tracks on the left reveal more of their overhead power line structures and a distinct red/yellow signal further down the tracks.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a two-lane road in the foreground and center, stretching into the distance under an overcast sky. To the left, a grassy verge borders a metal barrier, railroad tracks with overhead lines, and a steep, tree-covered mountain slope. To the right, a grassy verge and sidewalk lead to a parking area with multiple cars (a silver van, dark SUV, black car) in front of a large green industrial building with a partially visible blue sign, while distant mountains are visible straight ahead.
end of description
The viewpoint moves forward along the road. The parked vehicles on the right side progressively recede and exit the frame. As the viewer advances, the "JORMANN" sign on the green building becomes completely visible, and new stacks of metallic materials emerge on the right where the cars were. Simultaneously, the railroad tracks and the mountain on the left shift backward, and additional utility poles along the tracks move into and out of view.
