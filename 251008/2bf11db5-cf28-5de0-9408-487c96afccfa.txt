The first frame depicts a narrow, brick-paved alleyway extending forward from the viewer. To the viewer's left, a low red brick wall topped with traditional dark tiles runs along the path, with potted plants lining its base, and a multi-story yellow building visible behind it. To the viewer's right, a traditional-style building with a wooden door and white patterned facade, also topped with dark tiles, stands in the foreground, with another traditional building further down the alley on the right. A utility pole with wires is positioned in the mid-ground, slightly to the right of the center path, while a modern high-rise building is visible in the distance at the end of the alley against a light sky.

As the frames progress, the camera slowly moves forward down the alley, advancing past the initial viewpoint. The brick wall on the viewer's left and the traditional buildings on the viewer's right extend further into the immediate foreground, revealing more of their facades and details previously obscured further ahead, such as additional shop elements and signage like "KO KITCHEN." The utility pole, initially positioned on the viewer's right, is gradually passed by, appearing to shift from the center-right to the left side of the frame as the viewer moves deeper into the alley.

The first frame shows a narrow alley extending forward from the viewer, paved with green-toned bricks. To the viewer's left, a long brick wall with a traditional tiled roof is lined with potted plants, topped by a modern yellow and brown building. To the right, a utility pole is in the foreground, partially obscuring a traditional wooden-style building housing "NIKO KITCHEN" with an A-frame sign below it, while a distant modern building is visible above the alley's end.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward into the alley. The utility pole on the right gradually exits the frame, revealing more of the "NIKO KITCHEN" facade and its menu details. Concurrently, the brick wall and potted plants on the left move closer, and the green-paved alley scrolls beneath, indicating a steady progression deeper into the street.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows an alleyway with a red brick wall on the left, topped with traditional dark roof tiles and several potted plants at its base. Above the wall, part of a yellowish building with a window is visible. On the right, a traditional-style wooden building with a dark tiled roof features illuminated lanterns, a doorway, and a menu display, with potted plants also lining its base. The alley floor is paved with greenish-grey bricks, leading towards the distance where it curves slightly to the left, revealing more buildings and a tall, modern white building against an overcast sky in the background.
end of description
The camera gradually moves forward, advancing down the alleyway towards the distant curve. Objects previously in the mid-ground, such as the "NIKO KITCHEN" sign on the right building and the potted plants, appear progressively larger and closer to the viewer. This movement reveals more of the alley's depth and slightly shifts the perspective of the buildings on both sides, making previously distant details more prominent. The tall white building in the background also appears incrementally closer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A narrow, paved alley stretches into the distance, flanked by a reddish brick wall with a tiled roof and potted plants on the left, and traditional wooden buildings with ornate facades, lanterns, and potted plants on the right. Above the left wall, a building with windows and an orange upper floor is visible, while modern high-rise buildings and utility lines appear in the distant background under a pale sky.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly advances down the alley, causing both the brick wall and the traditional buildings on either side to recede, progressively revealing more of their lengths and details previously out of frame further ahead. The green paved surface underfoot continuously unfolds, while the distant background of modern buildings appears slightly closer.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a narrow alleyway with green paved flooring, flanked by a red brick wall on the left topped with traditional roof tiles and a modern windowed section, and a traditional wooden-framed building on the right displaying posters and several air conditioning units. A modern high-rise building stands in the distant background, visible at the end of the alley.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint gradually moves forward down the alley. The brick wall on the viewer's left and the traditional building on the viewer's right become progressively closer and larger, revealing more surface detail and the air conditioning units on the right-side building. The distant modern high-rise in front also subtly enlarges, consistent with forward motion along the original path.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a narrow alleyway extending forward from the viewer. To the left, a brick wall topped by a traditional tiled roof and modern windows stretches into the mid-ground. On the right, traditional-style buildings with closed, striped shutters and multiple air conditioning units line the path. The alley is paved with greenish bricks, leading to a modern building visible in the distant background, beneath overhead utility lines.
end of description
The scene subtly moves forward into the alley. The brick wall on the left and buildings on the right gradually pass the viewer, revealing more of the path ahead. A green door on the right and colorful lanterns above the left wall become newly visible as the distant modern building draws nearer, indicating progression towards the alley's end.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a narrow alleyway extending forward, bordered on the left by a red brick wall topped with a traditional tiled roof, and on the right by a row of low buildings featuring closed, striped metal shutters and air conditioning units. Above the left wall, colorful lanterns are visible, while a distant modern high-rise building is centered at the alley's end beneath overhead utility wires.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward into the alley, the structures lining both the left and right sides appear to approach and then pass, dynamically changing their perceived distance. The modern building at the end of the alley also progressively grows larger, indicating the viewer's closer proximity.
