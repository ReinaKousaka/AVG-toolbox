In the first frame, a red Vancouver Fire & Rescue pickup truck is parked on the sidewalk to the viewer's left, while a green pole with a traffic light and a red fire hydrant stand immediately to the viewer's right. A street extends into the midground with other vehicles and buildings on either side, leading towards red industrial cranes and snow-capped mountains in the distant background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the red pickup truck slowly moves forward and slightly left, gradually revealing the front of a larger white fire engine previously obscured behind it, positioned to the viewer's left. The white fire engine, equipped with a ladder, becomes increasingly visible as the red truck continues to move further away from the initial viewpoint.
