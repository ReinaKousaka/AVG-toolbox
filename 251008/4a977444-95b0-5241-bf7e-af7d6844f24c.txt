The first frame depicts a wet, rainy street scene with a sidewalk featuring a white center line extending into the hazy distance, bordered on the left by a brick fence and dense trees, and on the right by a curb, a planter, and a street where vehicles like a red car and a bus are visible moving away from the viewer.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the heavy rain persists while the vehicles on the street dynamically shift; the red car moves further into the distance, and a white car appears behind it, all progressing away from the first-frame viewpoint.

A wet paved path extends into a hazy distance, flanked by a brick and green fence on the left and a curb with bushes and trees on the right, under a rainy, overcast sky. Several cars are visible on the wet road to the right, beyond the trees, and tall trees line the left side of the path.

Throughout the frames, constant rain visibly falls, creating splashes and reflections on all surfaces, while tree leaves subtly sway. Vehicles move on the road to the right, with a green bus notably appearing from the middle ground and driving further into the distance. A piece of white debris also appears on the wet path in the middle ground, slightly shifting due to wind or water.
