In subsequent frames, the viewpoint slowly advances along the street. This causes the foreground cars on the right and left to progressively move out of frame towards the bottom and sides, revealing more of the road and buildings further ahead relative to the initial position. No new objects or scenes are introduced; the existing environment is simply revealed from a slightly forward perspective.
