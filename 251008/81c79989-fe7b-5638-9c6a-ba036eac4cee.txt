In the first frame, a large, blurry tree trunk dominates the immediate foreground on the far left. A wooden boardwalk curves into the middle distance towards the center-right, surrounded by a dense, moss-covered forest with numerous trees, while glimpses of a bright sky are visible in the upper right through the canopy. end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the boardwalk. The large tree trunk from the first frame recedes and moves past to the viewer's left, revealing more of the boardwalk ahead and the thick forest on both sides. New trees and mossy ground appear into view directly in front of the viewer and move past to the left and right as the path continues to curve gently through the verdant woods.
