The first frame shows a wet village street winding uphill, with traditional buildings on the left and center-right, and misty green mountains in the background. In the foreground-left, a 'CHALET ABENDROT' sign is visible, while a black car is parked on the midground-left, and several pedestrians with umbrellas are distributed along the wet road in the midground.

Subsequently, the black car on the midground-left slowly drives further up the street. Simultaneously, a group of pedestrians on the midground-right, holding umbrellas, walks from left to right across the frame, followed by an individual in a blue jacket. Further back on the midground-left, other pedestrians also advance slightly along the wet road.

The first frame displays a wet, reflective street in a mountain town, flanked by traditional buildings with red roofs; a large chalet with a sign is on the left, and a prominent orange-brown building features a distant steeple behind it. People with umbrellas are visible on the sidewalks and street, while a dark car is on the left, all set against a backdrop of mist-shrouded green mountains.

Across subsequent frames, a person in a blue jacket walks from the right foreground towards the left across the street, while the dark car on the left side of the road slowly drives further away. Other pedestrians on both sides of the street also exhibit subtle movement further into the scene.

In the first frame, a wet village street, reflecting the overcast sky, stretches into the midground. To the left, a multi-story building with a red-brown roof features a Swiss flag, while further down the street on the left, several people walk near a dark parked vehicle. Centrally located, a large building with a prominent red-tiled roof and a blue awning has an outdoor seating area with red and yellow umbrellas, behind which a white building with a steeple is visible. To the right, another building with a gray roof stands, fronted by a circular red 'no entry' sign, and two individuals under a white umbrella walk towards the viewer. Lush green hills and mist-shrouded mountains form the background.

end of description

The two individuals under the white umbrella on the right side of the street are observed moving away from the viewer, gradually receding into the midground. Concurrently, the small group of people on the left side of the street also appears to shift slightly, moving further into the scene. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the environment remains constant with only the movement of these people.
