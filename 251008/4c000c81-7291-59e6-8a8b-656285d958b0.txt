The first frame depicts a wet city street at night during heavy rain, with a pile of white trash bags on the right sidewalk in the foreground, adjacent to a utility pole and grey utility boxes. Buildings with illuminated signs line both sides of the street in the middle and background, their lights reflecting in the wet pavement, while people with umbrellas are visible in the distance. end of description
As frames progress, the visible rain intensifies, and a person with a red umbrella moves from the mid-ground left, crossing the street towards the right, while another figure on the far right sidewalk walks further away from the viewer. Concurrently, the traffic lights in the middle distance, to the left of the rightmost tree, dynamically change from green to amber and then to red.

The first frame displays a rainy city street at night, with several white trash bags in the bottom-left foreground and two grey utility boxes directly behind them. To the right, a tree trunk is visible, while the wet street, distant buildings with illuminated signs, streetlights, and a few pedestrians with umbrellas populate the background. end of description. In the following frames, a white car appears from the right background, swiftly traveling left across the street past the mid-ground utility boxes. Throughout the sequence, additional vehicle headlights remain visible in the distance on the right, and the heavy rain persists.

In the foreground, two large, light-grey utility boxes are positioned to the left and center-right of the viewer, sitting on a wet sidewalk. Behind them, a bustling city street extends into the midground, reflecting streetlights and distant vehicle headlights to the right, while a prominent tree trunk stands in the midground center-right. To the midground left, a traffic light displays red, and faint figures, including one with a red umbrella, are visible near the crosswalk; buildings with illuminated signs line the background on both sides.

The view subtly pans to the right, causing the rightmost utility box to recede from the frame and the left utility box to become more fully visible. Several vehicles with illuminated headlights gradually move across the wet street from the far right to the midground left. Notably, a white car drives from the right midground, passing behind the central tree trunk and the utility box. The pedestrian with the red umbrella, previously visible in the midground left, moves out of the frame as the scene shifts right.
