In the foreground left, a bus stop shelter displays "3:04" and "37Â°", with an advertisement depicting three people below. A person in a red jacket, viewing their phone, stands to the immediate left of the shelter. To the left of the frame's center, a yellow "SCHOOL" sign on a pole is visible, with a small bare tree in front of a street. A pedestrian bridge with ornate metalwork spans across the mid-ground street, and a tall brick wall runs along the far right. Further down the street, distant buildings and a few pedestrians walking away from the viewer are visible.

end of description

The person in the red jacket and the bus stop shelter gradually exit the frame to the left. Concurrently, a black SUV, initially in the street behind the bus stop to the left, drives forward and out of frame to the far left. As the camera pans right, elements like the 'SCHOOL' sign, the pedestrian bridge, and the brick wall, which were initially positioned in the mid-ground and right, shift towards the new center of the view. This panning motion reveals more of the street and buildings further to the right of the original leftmost visible area.
