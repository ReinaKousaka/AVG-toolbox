The first frame displays a night street scene at a T-junction. To the immediate left, a wooden utility box with a green top and a yellow "B1" sign is visible, next to a person in a light jacket standing partially facing away from the viewer. The road directly in front has white painted directional arrows. On the right, an orange traffic cone sits by a large yellow sign. Further down the street on the left, a white SUV is parked, followed by multi-story buildings with illuminated storefronts. Several cars, including a black sedan, are positioned further down the street, and on the right, more buildings with bright signs like "LG" line the road, with taller city structures fading into the dark background.

The person on the left slowly walks forward and turns, moving further down the street away from the viewer. Concurrently, the cars in the midground continue to progress down the street, gradually disappearing into the distance. A new yellow pedestrian crossing line appears on the road to the viewer's right, and the entire scene subtly brightens with a slight forward camera movement.

The viewer looks down a narrow, illuminated city street at night. To the foreground left, a person in a green shirt stands next to a silver SUV, while a black sedan is parked further down the street alongside brightly lit storefronts on the left. On the foreground right, an orange traffic cone sits on the sidewalk, with more buildings and parked vehicles visible further into the midground.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the person on the left walks away from the viewer, gradually moving out of view towards the left edge of the frame. The rest of the street scene, including the parked cars and buildings, remains largely static throughout the sequence.
