The first frame depicts a city street with a light grey tiled sidewalk in the foreground, transitioning to cobblestones and asphalt further back. A modern red and white building runs along the left, while a historic red brick building with a curved facade and an 'HMK' sign stands prominently on the right. A black lamppost, construction barriers on the left sidewalk, and a partially visible dark car on the far left are present, along with a person walking away from the viewer on the sidewalk near the brick building.

The person on the sidewalk continues to walk away from the viewer, moving past the brick building and eventually exiting the scene towards the background right. Subsequently, a silver car appears from the far right of the frame, driving away from the viewer on the street adjacent to the brick building.

The first frame depicts a city street with a large modern building with red and white panels on the left, extending into the background, and a paved sidewalk. In the foreground are cobblestones and a manhole cover. To the right, a two-story brick building with rounded corners and multiple windows, marked "HMK", stands next to a paved road where a silver car is partially visible on the far right.
end of description
Chronologically, the silver car on the right moves left across the street, eventually revealing a green scooter that appears behind its initial position to the far right. A person simultaneously emerges on the sidewalk near the brick building, walking towards the viewer, while a dark car in the distant background on the left street also advances slightly.
