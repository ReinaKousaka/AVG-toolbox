The first frame displays a wet street receding into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings. To the viewer's right, a light-colored building wall features a dark glass door, various utility pipes, meters, and an air conditioning unit; a black bicycle with a brown seat is parked against this wall, in front of vending machines.

In subsequent frames, a basket is attached to the front of the bicycle. The bicycle then slowly rotates counter-clockwise and is pulled slightly away from the wall, pivoting its front wheel towards the left.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a wet, narrow city street with buildings lining both sides under an overcast sky. In the immediate foreground to the viewer's right, a black bicycle with an orange seat is parked beside a stack of air conditioning units and two vending machines (a white "POKKA SAPPORO" and a blue "ASAHI") against a dark building wall with exposed pipes. Utility poles and more buildings recede into the distance along the left side of the street.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the bicycle is removed from the immediate foreground on the right side of the viewer's original position. The viewpoint subtly shifts slightly forward and to the right, revealing more of the adjacent building wall while reducing the visible expanse of the distant street, though the vending machines and air conditioning units remain stationary relative to the overall scene.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a wet urban street stretching into the distance, bordered by buildings on both sides. To the viewer's right, a white vending machine, several outdoor air conditioning units, and a graffiti-covered utility pole are positioned against a building wall. Buildings with ground-floor establishments line the street to the viewer's left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The vending machine, AC units, and utility pole on the right recede from view and eventually exit the frame to the right. The scene gradually shifts to reveal more of the street ahead and the distant buildings as the camera advances.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a wet asphalt street extends into the background, flanked by multi-story buildings. Immediately to the right, a graffiti-covered grey utility pole partially obscures a blue vending machine and several stacked outdoor air conditioning units. Further down the street on the right, additional buildings are visible. On the left side of the street, more buildings with various signs line the path, and an orange traffic cone is present in the mid-ground. The overall scene depicts a somewhat narrow urban street under what appears to be an overcast sky.

end of description

As the frames progress, the camera subtly pans to the right, gradually revealing the blue vending machine that was initially largely hidden behind the grey utility pole. The pole itself shifts further towards the far right edge of the frame, completely uncovering the vending machine's display. The vending machine is revealed to be an 'Asahi Soft Drink' branded machine with a '100 Special' price offer. Concurrently, additional air conditioning units and a dark utility box located further right and behind the vending machine become more clearly visible.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a wet, narrow city street stretches into the background under an overcast sky. To the immediate right, a blue vending machine filled with beverages is partially visible, positioned next to a graffiti-covered grey utility box on the sidewalk. Further along the right, a light-colored building features several air conditioning units, with an orange traffic cone and a parked motorcycle visible below them. On the left side, a multi-story building lined with various shops and signs extends into the distance.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward, causing the blue vending machine on the immediate right to gradually move out of view. This shift reveals more of the sidewalk and the light-colored building to its left, including additional crates that were previously obscured. Concurrently, a person carrying an umbrella emerges from the distant background, walking along the wet street towards the viewer's left side. This individual progresses closer to the first-frame viewpoint, appearing in the mid-left of the street by the final frame.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a wet urban street with buildings lining both sides. To the immediate right, a stack of red, green, blue, and yellow crates along with cardboard boxes rests beside a light blue door, with an orange traffic cone on the asphalt closer to the viewer. On the left, storefronts with Japanese signage adorn a building, while further down the street, two figures, one holding a white umbrella, walk away from the viewer. A white scooter is parked near a utility pole in the mid-ground right.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the stack of crates and boxes on the right side of the street progressively diminishes as items are removed. Simultaneously, the two figures on the left side of the street continue to walk further away from the viewer, eventually disappearing from view down the distant street. The orange cone and parked scooter remain stationary in their positions relative to the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a wet, narrow urban street receding into the distance under an overcast sky, flanked by multi-story buildings; an orange traffic cone rests on the street to the viewer's immediate right, while a white building wall with a dark utility box and a parked white scooter near a utility pole is also on the right, and shopfronts line the building on the left where two people with umbrellas are seen further down the street.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the orange cone, scooter, and surrounding buildings remain stationary relative to the viewer, but additional pedestrians with umbrellas appear further down the street on the left and move into the distance away from the viewer.
