The first frame presents a serene winter mountainscape featuring a blue-grey river with visible rocks flowing in the foreground, its banks laden with thick white snow. Across the river, an embankment rises to a charming village with multi-story buildings and varied architecture, nestled into a snow-covered hillside dotted with evergreen and bare trees. In the background, majestic snow-capped mountains stretch under a bright blue sky with a few white clouds and a faint crescent moon.

As frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts to the left, revealing more of a light blue bridge railing and a snow-covered path on the far left, adjacent to the river. Concurrently, the 'Aksent' watermark gradually emerges and clarifies in the upper right corner of the scene.
