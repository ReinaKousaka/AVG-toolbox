In the foreground, grey paving stones cover the ground directly in front of the viewer. In the midground, a traditional Chinese building facade spans the width, featuring two partially open, reddish-brown wooden doors with intricate lattice patterns, centered before the viewer. A wooden column is visible to the right of the doors, and another is partially seen at the far left edge. To the right of the right door, a grey brick wall section houses a yellow and white sign on the ground, with a lattice window above it. Through the open doors, an interior space with tiled flooring reveals a dark wooden table with an object on it to the left, a dark wooden chair to the right, and a large dark-framed scroll hanging on the far back wall.

Through the sequence, the two large wooden doors in the midground progressively swing wider outwards, moving away from the center. This action continually reveals more of the room's interior behind them. As the doors fully open, a second dark wooden chair to the left of the table and a larger view of the white back wall with two distinct framed items become visible deeper within the room. Concurrently, the viewer's perspective subtly advances into the scene, making the interior objects appear larger and closer by the final frame.

The first frame displays wide-open wooden doors with intricate latticework windows, framing a view into a room with a tiled floor. Centered within this room, a dark wooden table with an ornate display is flanked by two matching wooden chairs, all set against a white back wall adorned with two large framed posters.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward into the room, revealing more of its depth. The previously partially obscured dark wooden structures along both the viewer's left and right side walls become fully visible, extending from the foreground towards the back. Decorative red and yellow elements appear hanging from the wooden structure on the right, while a small framed picture becomes distinct on the left side wall further back.
