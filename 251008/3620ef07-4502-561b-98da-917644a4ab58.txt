The first frame presents a street scene with a large tree trunk on the far left and a vintage street lamp post prominently on the right, both vertically framing a paved sidewalk where people and cyclists move away from the viewer. A historic red-bricked building is visible on the far left behind the tree, while a concrete wall on the right borders a green area with numerous trees and distant tall buildings under a grey sky.

As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward; the street lamp post and the large tree on the left recede out of view. The red-bricked building on the far left becomes more prominent, revealing more of its facade, while distant urban structures behind the trees on the right also become clearer.
