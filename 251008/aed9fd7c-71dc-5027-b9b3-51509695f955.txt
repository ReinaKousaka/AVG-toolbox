The first frame displays a covered outdoor patio with a seating area—including a sofa, coffee table with a lantern, and armchairs—situated against a light brick wall on the left, beneath a central ceiling fan, while a swimming pool with water features and lush trees are visible to the right and in the background under a blue sky.
