The first frame captures an asphalt road leading forward, with a cyclist on a red bike positioned in the immediate foreground-left and three pedestrians walking towards the viewer on the right sidewalk. In the midground, a red car is parked on a diverging path to the left, behind which stands a two-story house covered in ivy; green trees line both sides of the road and hillside.

As the frames progress, the cyclist exits the scene to the far left, while the three pedestrians move past the viewer on the right sidewalk, eventually exiting the frame to the viewer's left. The viewpoint advances slightly, revealing more of the left-curving road and a white recycling bin structure that emerges from behind the fence on the right.
