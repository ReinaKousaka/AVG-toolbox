The first frame displays a rain-soaked city street at night, viewed from a low angle. In the foreground, a wet sidewalk with yellow tactile paving strips runs from left to right, with a dark utility box visible on the far right. In the midground, two white taxis with illuminated roof signs are stationary or moving very slowly on the wet asphalt road, facing away and slightly to the right of the viewer, with the leading car's red brake lights reflecting on the ground. A small green bush sits between the sidewalk and the street on the left, while trees and distant building lights line the street receding into the rainy background.

As the frames advance, the leading white taxi slowly inches forward, its front left wheel creating an increasingly pronounced splash of water that rises and extends forward. The second taxi to its right also progresses subtly, maintaining its relative position. The wet road surface continually reflects the cars' lights more intensely as they move, while distant car headlights become slightly brighter and more defined further down the street on the far left.
