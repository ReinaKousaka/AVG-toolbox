The first frame shows a train track curving slightly right into the forested distance, bordered by dense green and some autumnal trees on the left, under an overcast sky, with overhead wires spanning above and an orange circular sign prominently on the far left.
end of description
As the train moves forward, the orange sign rapidly exits the frame to the viewer's left and behind. The surrounding forest and ground continually advance past the viewer, revealing new sections of dense foliage, with the autumnal trees on the left becoming progressively closer and more defined. Additionally, overhead power line pylons, initially visible further ahead on the left, sequentially approach and pass by the viewer's left side.
