The first frame captures a snowy landscape with a prominent red informational sign and a frosty bare tree in the foreground. Behind them, a multi-story building with a curved gray section and brick facades is visible, featuring large windows. To the left, a snow-covered path leads toward other distant campus buildings, including one with a steeple, all under a clear blue sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly pans right, causing the red sign to gradually move out of view to the right. This shift reveals more of the main building's front entrance and the snow-covered ground in front of it. The frosty tree, initially right of center, also moves further to the right within the frame.

The first frame shows a snow-covered scene under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a path runs from the lower left towards the mid-right, bordered by snow and large, light-colored rocks on the left. A bicycle is parked on the snowy ground to the left of the path. The midground is dominated by a multi-story modern building with a curved gray facade and sections of light brown brick, featuring numerous windows; its main entrance is towards the center-right. To the immediate right of this building is a frost-covered tree. In the background on the far left, other beige buildings and distant vehicles are visible.

Across the subsequent frames, the camera slowly pans to the right. This motion gradually reveals more of the main building's right-hand facade and more of the frost-covered tree situated to its right, both shifting slightly to the left within the frame. Simultaneously, the buildings and vehicles in the far left background progressively move out of view. No new objects are introduced into the scene; rather, existing elements are dynamically re-framed.
