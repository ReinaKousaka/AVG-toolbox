In the first frame, snow-covered train tracks extend from the bottom-left and bottom-right towards the center, receding into the distance. To the immediate right, a vertical pole supports overhead power lines, which stretch across the upper portion of the frame. On the left side, a long, snow-covered wooden building with an open loading dock area containing colorful boxes is visible alongside the tracks. Further to the right and slightly behind the wooden building, a red train is parked next to a larger, snow-covered station building. Majestic snow-capped mountains dominate the background, with a bright blue sky above.
end of description
The camera moves forward along the tracks and slightly to the right. The vertical pole, initially in the mid-right foreground, moves progressively left and out of view, revealing more snowy tracks and the station platform to the right and directly ahead. The long wooden building, positioned to the viewer's left, becomes increasingly visible as the camera moves alongside it, exposing more of its loading bay details. Concurrently, the red train and adjacent station building, initially in the mid-right, are gradually passed by the camera, appearing further to the right and revealing more of the area beyond them. Finally, a multi-story brown building behind the wooden structure on the left becomes clearly visible as the camera progresses forward.
