The first frame displays a wide, sunlit dirt path stretching into the distance, centrally positioned. To the viewer's left, a large dark-barked tree trunk stands prominently in the foreground, with another slightly behind it, followed by a line of evergreen and red-leafed trees. To the right, numerous small maple trees with vibrant red and orange leaves dot a grassy area covered in fallen yellow leaves, with a small wooden sign visible further right.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the path. The large foreground trees on the viewer's left in the initial frame gradually recede and move further left, eventually exiting the frame. Concurrently, the maple trees and the wooden sign initially on the right also recede to the left, while new sections of the path and additional autumn-colored trees continuously emerge ahead and to the right, maintaining the autumnal pathway scene.

In the first frame, two large tree trunks dominate the left foreground, with a wooden bench partially visible behind the leftmost trunk. A dirt path stretches from the viewer into the distance, bordered by numerous trees showcasing vibrant autumn foliage, mainly red and orange on the right and a mix of yellow, green, and red on the left. The sky, speckled with white clouds, is visible above the tree line, and fallen leaves cover the ground flanking the path.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the path. The two large tree trunks and the wooden bench on the left shift further left and eventually out of frame, revealing more of the path they once partially obscured. Distant people walking on the path, initially in the mid-background of the first frame, grow slightly larger and more discernible as the camera advances towards them. The surrounding autumn trees continue to line the path as new sections of the scenic route become visible in the foreground.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame features a wide, light-colored dirt path extending from the viewer's immediate front into the midground. A prominent dark-barked tree trunk stands in the left foreground, partially obscuring a cluster of trees with yellow and green foliage further left. To the right of the path, numerous trees display vibrant red and orange autumn leaves, with fallen leaves scattered on the ground. The path is flanked by trees with varied autumn colors and some evergreens in the mid-distance, all beneath a blue sky with scattered white clouds in the background. A 'SEOUL WALKER' watermark is present in the bottom left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint advances smoothly along the path. The large tree trunk on the immediate left gradually moves out of the frame to the viewer's left, revealing more of the path and the trees behind it relative to the original position. Distant, indistinct figures initially observed ahead on the path become slightly larger and more discernible as the camera moves forward from the first-frame viewpoint. The scene continuously reveals new sections of the path and the autumn foliage further into the park.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a light-colored dirt path extending from the bottom center towards the distant background, flanked by ground covered in fallen autumn leaves. To the viewer's left, several tall green evergreen trees stand alongside trees displaying vibrant red and orange autumn foliage, with indistinct figures walking further back. To the right, numerous trees with rich red and some brown autumn leaves line the path, also with fallen leaves scattered on the ground. A bright blue sky with a few wispy clouds is visible above the trees in the background.
end of description
The camera subtly moves forward, causing the path and surrounding trees to appear slightly closer and revealing a fraction more of the scene ahead. The relative positions of the trees on both sides shift minimally, indicating a very gradual progression through the autumn park. Minor, slow changes are also observed in the shadows cast upon the path.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a serene autumn park scene with a light brown, unpaved path extending from the bottom center into the distance, flanked by abundant trees. On the left, a tall evergreen tree is prominent near the foreground, followed by a mix of trees with red, orange, and green foliage lining the path, and small figures are visible among them further back. On the right, a vibrant red-leafed tree stands closer to the viewer, with more similarly colored trees receding along the path into the mid-ground. The ground on both sides of the path is covered with dry grass and scattered fallen leaves, all beneath a clear blue sky dotted with white clouds. A "SEOUL WALKER" watermark appears in the bottom-left corner.
end of description
The viewer begins a slow, steady forward motion along the path. As the camera moves forward from its initial position, objects that were further down the path in the first frame, such as distant trees and people, progressively become closer and more detailed. Concurrently, the immediate foreground visible in the first frame gradually moves behind the viewer's current position, exiting the bottom of the frame. This continuous forward progression allows for a closer look at the winding path and the vibrant autumn foliage ahead, without revealing any entirely new objects or scenes that were previously hidden from the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a scenic path stretching from the foreground into the background, flanked by numerous trees showcasing autumn foliage. A prominent tall evergreen tree stands slightly left of the path's center, extending upwards, with smaller red-leafed trees positioned to its left and closer to the viewer. To the right, a dense canopy of trees with vibrant red and orange leaves lines the path, while the light-colored path itself is scattered with fallen leaves. The ground on either side is covered with dry grass, and a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds is visible above the distant path, where faint figures can be seen walking. A "SEOUL WALKER" watermark is present in the bottom-left corner.
end of description
The camera slowly moves forward along the path, causing the foreground trees and ground to shift out of view towards the sides and behind the viewer's initial position. Concurrently, new segments of the path and additional autumn trees further along the original path are continuously revealed ahead. The distant figures, initially observed in the background of the first frame, progressively enlarge and draw closer, moving towards the viewer's evolving position. This steady forward motion consistently unveils more of the autumnal landscape ahead, maintaining the scene of red and green trees under a blue sky.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a path, likely dirt or gravel, extending from the viewer's foreground into the background, flanked by dried grassy areas. A tall green pine tree stands prominently to the left of the path in the midground, while numerous trees displaying vibrant red and some yellow autumn foliage line both sides of the path, receding into the distance. The background features blurry figures walking further down the path amidst more colorful trees, all set under a bright blue sky with sparse white clouds visible above the tree line.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the path relative to the first-frame position. The tall green pine tree on the left and the red-leafed trees on both sides slowly shift from the midground to the sides and eventually behind the initial viewpoint. The blurry figures in the background become slightly clearer and closer to the original midground position, while new sections of the path and distant autumn trees are continually revealed ahead of the first-frame's initial background.
