The first frame captures a snowy city street scene. To the left, a silver car is partially visible in the foreground on a wet road. Across the wet asphalt to the center-right, two white benches, dusted with snow, extend towards the viewer on the sidewalk. In the midground, a bus is stopped at a bus stop, with people gathered on the sidewalk waiting, and overhead trolley lines visible above the street. On the left side of the street, the "Hudson's Bay" building stands with storefronts, while on the right, a modern building with a "Chatime" sign features an illuminated entrance, and people walk along the sidewalk. Tall buildings rise in the background under an overcast sky, with snowflakes visibly falling throughout the scene.

The silver car on the left side of the frame slowly moves forward, gradually exiting the view towards the right. Simultaneously, a person wearing a dark coat and light pants enters the frame from the far right on the sidewalk, walking towards the viewer. Another individual behind them on the right sidewalk also progresses forward, approaching the viewer. The bus and the crowd at the bus stop remain largely stationary in the midground, while snow consistently falls across the entire scene.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a snowy city street scene with a long, articulated trolley bus stopped at a bus stop in the center, its brake lights illuminated. To the right of the viewer, several people wait under a shelter next to a modern building, and a snow-dusted white bench is visible in the foreground. On the left, a wet street leads past an older building displaying "HUDSON'S BAY" and a partially visible car in the bottom left. Tall city buildings rise in the background under an overcast sky, with light snow falling.
end of description
As the frames progress, the snowfall intensifies subtly, with more visible flakes descending across the entire scene. Consequently, the accumulation of snow on the white bench in the foreground and along the sidewalk becomes incrementally thicker relative to its initial state.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
A snowy urban street scene shows a red trolley bus stopped on the wet road to the viewer's left, with several people gathered at a bus stop shelter to the right. In the foreground, a snow-dusted wooden bench sits to the right, while tall buildings, including "Hudson's Bay" on the left and a modern structure with an "Arc'teryx" sign on the right, line the street.
end of description
The trolley bus gradually departs forward and to the left, revealing more of the wet road it occupied. Concurrently, a new person appears from the far right of the frame, slowly walking towards the bus stop area, as heavy snow continues to fall throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures a snowy city street scene with a partially visible bus and several people at a glass bus shelter on the far left, a snow-dusted bench in the foreground, and a dark, reflective modern building with an 'Arturia' sign under an awning dominating the midground to the right, all under falling snowflakes.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the bus on the far left slowly moves away from the first-frame viewpoint down the street. Concurrently, the people standing near the bus stop begin to disperse, walking further down the street to the left. The camera subtly pans right and zooms in slightly throughout the sequence, increasing the prominence of the right-hand building while snow continues to fall.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a snowy urban sidewalk, with a glass bus stop shelter occupying the left foreground where a person in a dark coat is visible. Further down the sidewalk, a group of people walk away from the viewer into the midground. To the right, a dark, modern building with a patterned panel on its far right edge rises, featuring an illuminated entrance overhang beneath which a person in a light jacket stands in the midground. Snowflakes are visibly falling across the entire wet scene under an overcast sky.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the person standing under the building's overhang on the right slowly backs away and shifts further to the right, mostly exiting the frame behind the patterned wall by the final frame. The falling snowflakes continue to blanket the entire scene, and the group of people on the sidewalk maintains their movement away from the viewer in the distance.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a wet city street under light precipitation and an overcast sky. On the right, a dark building with multiple black doors, featuring "CAUTION" signs and a wall-mounted light, hosts two pedestrians: one standing near the far right edge and another leaning against the wall further left. To the left, a building with glass storefronts and an awning borders a busy sidewalk where numerous pedestrians walk away into the distant urban background.
end of description
Across the following frames, the person initially standing on the far right slowly walks further away from the viewer, moving towards the left side of the scene. All other visible objects and pedestrians remain largely stationary, while the light snowfall persists throughout the entire sequence.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a snowy urban street scene from a low angle, with a black building wall to the right featuring "CAUTION" signs, a bright light, and a person standing next to it. To the left, a bus stop shelter holds several people, while pedestrians walk down the wet street ahead, flanked by distant buildings under an overcast sky.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, snowflakes consistently fall across the entire scene. The pedestrians in the midground continue walking away, the person by the black wall on the right remains largely stationary, and the bus stop occupants exhibit minor shifts. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the viewpoint remains static, capturing the ongoing snowfall and subtle human movements within the original environment.
