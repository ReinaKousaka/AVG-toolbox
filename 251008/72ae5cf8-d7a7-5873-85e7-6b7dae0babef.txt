In the first frame, the viewer is on a gray paved sidewalk. To the viewer's left is an asphalt road receding into the distance, with a dark SUV-like car driving away in the mid-ground. Further left, a sidewalk fronts the multi-story "HOTEL HIRSCHEN" building with wooden balconies and Swiss flags; a few pedestrians are visible there. To the viewer's right stands another multi-story building with "ESPRESSO-BAR" written on its facade. In the far background, majestic mountains rise at the end of the street.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The "ESPRESSO-BAR" building on the right and the "HOTEL HIRSCHEN" on the left appear closer, revealing more details of their facades, including a large door on the right building and a number "35" becoming visible on the sidewalk closer to the viewer. The dark SUV and pedestrians on the left sidewalk recede further down the street relative to the advancing viewpoint.

The first frame shows a view down a street in what appears to be a mountain village. To the right, a paved sidewalk occupies the foreground, bordered by a multi-story building with a light facade, dark wooden accents, and several windows, including a large dark-paneled section at the far right. A dark asphalt road extends from the center foreground into the midground, curving slightly to the left. On the left side of the road, another multi-story building with wooden balconies and a green awning (partially reading "HOTEL") runs parallel, with several pedestrians walking on its sidewalk and a turquoise car parked further down. In the background, more buildings line the curving street, and majestic, jagged mountains rise into a partly cloudy sky.

The viewpoint slowly advances forward down the street. As the viewer moves, the buildings on both sides become progressively closer, revealing more of their facades. The large dark-paneled section of the building on the right eventually moves out of frame, revealing more windows with flower boxes. Pedestrians on both sidewalks also appear to move, with new individuals entering from behind the initial viewpoint on the left.

The first frame presents a village street, with traditional wooden buildings featuring balconies on the left and a multi-story building with flower-filled window boxes on the right, all receding towards distant mountains. Numerous pedestrians populate both sidewalks, and a teal car is visible further down the street.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, more of the right-side building's facade and its "HOTEL RESTAURANT" sign become increasingly visible, moving closer to the initial viewpoint. Pedestrians initially ahead and to the left and right gradually move closer, then past the first-frame's position, while the teal car on the street also approaches the original viewpoint.
