The first frame displays a long, wide city street with a central sidewalk. To the left, a multi-lane road has vehicles moving away from the viewer, bordered by buildings, while to the right, a row of bare trees stands alongside parked cars and ornate buildings. A lone person walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk in the distance.

The person on the sidewalk continues walking further away. The white parked car on the right drives forward and is replaced by a large white delivery van, which also proceeds forward, revealing additional parked cars beyond. Simultaneously, vehicles on the road to the left drive past as the entire scene slowly progresses forward.

The first frame depicts a city street with a paved sidewalk extending into the distance, where a person walks away from the viewer. To the viewer's left, a multi-lane road features parked and moving cars alongside tall buildings, with a prominent lamp post nearby. To the right, a grassy strip with benches and bare trees separates the sidewalk from more buildings and parked cars, including a red-and-white bollard in the foreground.

In subsequent frames, the person on the sidewalk continues to walk further away from the first-frame viewpoint. Cars on the road to the viewer's left move forward, with new vehicles entering the frame from behind the first-frame viewpoint and proceeding down the street. The red-and-white bollard on the right side also gradually moves further away from the first-frame viewpoint.
