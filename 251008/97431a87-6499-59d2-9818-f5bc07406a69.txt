The first frame reveals a vibrant underwater coral reef with numerous hard and soft corals. In the mid-ground, a large golden-yellow branching coral stands prominently slightly right of center, while three fish are visible: one light damselfish centrally located above the golden coral, another light damselfish partially obscured in the lower right foreground, and a smaller dark fish near the top center.

Subsequently, the central damselfish slowly ascends and shifts slightly left, while the lower-right damselfish moves further right along the bottom. Simultaneously, a new dark fish emerges from the upper left and joins the existing dark fish near the top, with both traversing horizontally across the upper portion of the frame as other smaller fish intermittently appear around the established coral structures.
