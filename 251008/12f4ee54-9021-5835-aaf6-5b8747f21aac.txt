The first frame presents a vibrant city street scene at dusk or early evening. To the viewer's far left, a tree with green foliage partially obscures the sidewalk and a street bustling with distant vehicles and pedestrians moving away. Dominating the midground to the viewer's right is a row of brightly lit storefronts; the closest one features a large male mannequin in a white shirt and black pants with a raised arm, standing outside its entrance. Near the mannequin are two individuals: one in a dark hoodie and another with a white backpack, both to the viewer's front-right. Further left along this row, another establishment displays outdoor picnic tables and an A-frame sign on the sidewalk, with additional pedestrians scattered throughout the midground. Tall, illuminated buildings line the background under a darkening sky.
end of description
From the first-frame viewpoint, the person in the dark hoodie, initially in the front-right, begins walking forward and towards the left, eventually passing the mannequin. Concurrently, the individual with the white backpack, positioned behind and slightly left of the hooded person, also moves forward and leftward, gradually passing the mannequin from the initial viewpoint. As the scene progresses, the large mannequin and the storefront it occupies, originally in the front-right of the first frame, appear to draw nearer and shift further right in the field of view. The A-frame sign, initially further left than the mannequin, similarly shifts towards the right and becomes closer, indicating a change in the viewer's immediate surroundings.
