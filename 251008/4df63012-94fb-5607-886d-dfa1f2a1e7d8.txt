The first frame depicts a straight multi-lane road extending into the distance under a partly cloudy sky, flanked by buildings on both the left and right sides. In the mid-foreground, a crosswalk spans the road; to the left, parked scooters line storefronts, including a prominent '京美家具' sign, while to the right, a white car is parked beside more buildings and trees. A tall cellular tower is visible centrally in the background, and a navigation overlay occupies the top-left corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves steadily forward along the road. The crosswalk initially in the mid-foreground passes beneath the viewer, while a white scooter, first seen further down on the left, advances across the road towards the center, moving closer to the viewer's path. Concurrently, the parked white car on the right recedes and eventually moves out of frame to the bottom-right, and buildings on both sides continually shift towards the edges, reflecting the forward progression.

The first frame shows a multi-lane street extending into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings with storefronts and trees on both sides. Parked vehicles line the curbs, and an overhead blue road sign hangs in the mid-distance, while a tall communication tower is visible further down the road towards the center.
end of description
The viewpoint continuously moves forward along the street. A white scooter in the left lane drives ahead of the viewer, eventually turning right and moving out of frame, as other vehicles in the distance approach and recede.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
A city street extends into the distance with a paved road marked by white straight, left-turn, and right-turn arrows in the foreground. Multi-story buildings and trees line both the left and right sides of the street, with parked and moving cars visible along the road. A prominent blue overhead road sign is positioned in the mid-distance on the right, while a tall communications tower stands in the distant left.
end of description
The viewpoint moves forward along the road. The blue overhead road sign gradually rises and moves out of the top of the frame. Vehicles initially parked on the right and left, like the white van and black SUV, move out of frame to their respective sides as the viewer passes them. A new white sedan then appears on the left, moving closer to the viewer, followed by another white van.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures a bustling city street from a forward perspective, with multi-story buildings and storefronts lining both sides. Numerous cars are parked along the curbs to the immediate left and right, while other vehicles populate the multi-lane road ahead, leading towards a distant traffic light intersection and a communication tower on the far left.

end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, parked cars on the left and right are gradually passed. Vehicles ahead continue to move, with a black SUV shifting from the viewer's immediate left lane to further ahead, and a white sedan appearing in the left lane. A motorcycle also emerges from the viewer's left, moving towards the center of the road.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a wide city street extending directly in front of the viewer, flanked by multi-story buildings on both the left and right, many partially obscured by trees. Numerous vehicles, including cars, trucks, and motorcycles, are visible on the road, mostly moving away from the viewer into the mid-distance, while some cars are parked along the right curb. A tall communications tower stands prominently above the buildings on the far left, and an overhead gantry with a red traffic light hangs over the road in the mid-right distance.
end of description
From the initial viewpoint, traffic begins to flow as a silver SUV on the mid-left side of the road advances past the viewer's immediate left. Concurrently, a white SUV and a white sedan, previously on the right, proceed further down the street away from the viewer. On the far left, a white utility vehicle and a truck also move forward relative to the viewer, with several motorcycles and scooters also seen passing by on both sides of the road as the scene progresses.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a multi-lane road looking forward towards a distant intersection under an overcast sky. To the immediate left, a white SUV is partially visible, followed by a red truck and other queued vehicles, with multi-story buildings and trees lining the street beyond. On the right, a person on a white scooter is ahead of the viewer, followed by a white car, while multiple parked scooters and buildings with storefronts and trees extend along the sidewalk. Directly ahead, traffic lights are suspended above the road, showing red, and a white forward arrow is painted on the road surface. An informational overlay is present in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the viewer's vehicle moves forward, the white SUV on the left and the scooter and white sedan on the right also progressively advance, eventually receding from the immediate foreground. A black SUV, initially partially obscured by the white SUV to the left, becomes fully visible as the viewer draws closer. Concurrently, new sections of the roadside buildings, sidewalks, and parked scooters on both sides are revealed. The central traffic lights, initially red, remain so for most of the sequence before changing to green towards the final frames.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The viewer is positioned behind a scooter at a city intersection, facing forward on a multi-lane road with pedestrian crossings in the foreground. Buildings and trees line both sides of the street, with a green pharmacy storefront visible on the right, as overhead traffic lights display a red light and a green straight-ahead arrow.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the scooter and a white minivan directly ahead of the viewer move forward and to the left. A white sedan to the viewer's right also advances forward. Concurrently, the green straight-ahead arrow on the left overhead gantry turns red, while a new green left-turn arrow and another green straight-ahead light illuminate on a separate gantry to the right.
