The first frame captures a rainy street scene with a purple electric scooter leaning against a metal railing in the foreground on the right. To the left, a silver SUV and a red bus move away from the viewer on a wet road, backed by distant buildings. A sidewalk with green bushes and trees stretches along the right side.

As the frames progress, the purple scooter is removed from its foreground position. An orange traffic cone then appears near the tree trunk in the midground, roughly where the scooter was, while a white SUV and other vehicles continuously move further away on the road to the left. The visible rain appears to intensify, creating more splashing on the wet surfaces.
