In the foreground to the viewer's left is a large red sign with prominent Korean text. A wet, paved pedestrian street stretches straight ahead, flanked by small trees, leading to a street in the midground where cars and people with umbrellas are visible through the falling rain. To the viewer's right, a building displaying "No Brand Burger" signage and a large yellow advertisement featuring a woman is seen.

The camera subtly pulls back, revealing more of the storefronts and additional yellow advertisement signs to the left of the red sign. A green and white bus enters the midground from the right, slowly traversing the street towards the left. People with umbrellas and other vehicles continue to move through the rainy background, maintaining the street's activity.

The first frame displays a rainy city street and sidewalk. The wet pedestrian pavement in the foreground leads to a midground crosswalk, lined by trees on both sides. A green bus is visible on the far-left street and a silver SUV on the far-right street in the midground, with pedestrians holding umbrellas walking across the crosswalk and along the far-right sidewalk. Buildings flank the scene, with yellow display stands to the viewer's far left and large yellow advertisements on a building to the far right.

The green bus on the far left advances, while the silver SUV on the far right proceeds forward and then exits the scene. Pedestrians with umbrellas continue walking across the mid-distance crosswalk and along the right sidewalk, with a new person in a blue dress and pink umbrella appearing on the far-right side. A red and white bus emerges from the background to the far right, replacing the SUV, and a traffic light on the far left turns green.

The first frame shows a wet city street and sidewalk on a rainy day. Directly in front of the viewer, the wet sidewalk extends towards a crosswalk with yellow and white stripes. Small trees are positioned along the sidewalk and the street, with black bollards marking the crosswalk. To the far left, a building facade is visible, while a red and white bus is stopped to the right of the crosswalk. Several pedestrians with umbrellas are crossing the street in the distance, and one person with a white umbrella is walking towards the left on the far side of the street.
end of description
A dark umbrella slowly appears at the very top of the frame, partially obscuring the view as if held by the viewer, starting from the second frame and remaining. The person with the white umbrella on the right side of the street continues walking forward, progressively moving left relative to the viewer's initial position. Other pedestrians with umbrellas continue to move across the distant crosswalk. A "Rain Everyday" watermark gradually fades in at the bottom-left corner of the frames starting from the third frame.
