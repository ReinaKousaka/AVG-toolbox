The first frame presents an aerial view of a large, open-air football stadium, identified as "HEINZ FIELD" by text in the bottom-left. The viewer is positioned high above and slightly to the front-left of the stadium, looking down into its interior. A vibrant green playing field occupies the center, surrounded by numerous tiers of empty, predominantly orange-yellow seats. Large architectural structures, including covered stands, flank the stadium on the left, right, and at the far end (top), where a prominent Jumbotron is visible. Surrounding the stadium, urban infrastructure with buildings and highways extends into the distant background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera slowly moves upwards and backwards, causing the entire stadium to appear gradually smaller in the frame, revealing more of the surrounding urban landscape. Simultaneously, the viewpoint subtly orbits clockwise around the stadium from its initial position. This slight rotation shifts the stadium's front-left sections slightly towards the viewer's front-right, revealing more of the structure's left facade. Concurrently, the green field and seating bowl subtly rotate clockwise within the frame, with the jumbotron at the far end shifting further right.
