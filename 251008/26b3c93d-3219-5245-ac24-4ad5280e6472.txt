The black car then drives right and away from the viewer across the pedestrian crossing. A blue police car is newly revealed to the left, parked on the sidewalk near the ZARA entrance. Concurrently, the white SUV continues moving further right and away from the viewer, and a scooter subsequently enters from the left to cross the road, also moving right past the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame captures a bustling city street scene at dusk. In the foreground, a prominent zebra crossing spans the road, with a scooter carrying two riders moving from the bottom-left towards the center. Behind the scooter and slightly to its left, a blue police car with flashing lights and "POLIZIA" text is visible, also on the road. To the left, a large, ornate building housing a brightly lit ZARA store dominates the mid-ground, featuring multiple arched windows and a crowd of pedestrians on the sidewalk in front. To the right, another multi-story building with numerous windows extends into the background, with more pedestrians on its sidewalk and a partial view of a red car in the bottom right corner.
end of description
The scooter, initially positioned on the left side of the crosswalk, moves steadily forward and to the right, eventually exiting the frame. The blue police car, starting behind the scooter and slightly to its left, then advances onto the crosswalk and continues to move right across the viewer's field of vision. Concurrently, the red car in the bottom right corner moves further right and disappears from view. Pedestrians on both sidewalks continue their movement relative to the buildings, though no new objects are revealed.

The first frame displays a lively city street scene featuring a broad pedestrian crosswalk spanning the road in the foreground, with a dark metal barrier positioned to its bottom right. To the left, a sizable crowd of pedestrians are situated on the sidewalk and beginning to traverse the street on the crosswalk. Dominating the midground is a large building housing a 'ZARA' store, identifiable by its prominent sign and illuminated glass windows showcasing clothing. A blue and white police car is stopped on the street to the right of the crosswalk, and further right, another multi-storied building with numerous windows stands against a pale sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the pedestrians steadily advance across the crosswalk from the left side of the street towards the right sidewalk. Simultaneously, a white car gradually enters the scene from the far left, driving into the mid-left portion of the frame and passing the crosswalk. The blue and white police car remains stationary on the right side of the street throughout the sequence.

In the first frame, a white hatchback car is visible on the lower left, partially on a zebra crosswalk that spans the street directly in front of the viewer. Behind the crosswalk and street, a brightly lit ZARA store building occupies the center and left, showcasing display windows and a main entrance, with numerous pedestrians gathered on the sidewalk and entering/exiting. To the right, another multi-story building lines the street.
end of description
The white car proceeds from the left side of the frame across the crosswalk towards the right, progressively revealing its side and then its rear as it moves further to the right from the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, pedestrians continue to cross the street from left to right, including a person on an orange scooter who also moves rightward across the crosswalk, eventually passing out of view to the right behind the car.
