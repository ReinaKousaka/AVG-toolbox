In the first frame, white crosswalk stripes are prominent in the foreground. To the left, a silver pickup truck is partially visible, parked beside a 'Mexican Food' stand with an orange cone and green items. Behind these, a wide sidewalk features several pedestrians walking away from the viewer, flanked by a large building with colorful murals. On the right, a white police vehicle is parked on the street, with a "ONE WAY" sign above it and a digital advertising screen nearby. Further down the street on the right, additional buildings and a dark SUV in the far background complete the urban scene.

As frames progress, the group of pedestrians on the left sidewalk moves further into the background, becoming smaller. The dark SUV on the far right of the street also recedes further into the background. Subsequently, a yellow taxi cab emerges from the far right background and proceeds into the mid-right background, driving away from the viewer.

The first frame presents a city street with a wide sidewalk on the left, featuring colorful murals on an adjacent building extending into the background. White crosswalk lines are in the foreground, with an orange cone and green equipment on the far left of the sidewalk, while several pedestrians walk away towards the background-center. To the right, a white police car is parked on the street, behind which a yellow taxi drives away, with tall buildings and a 'ONE WAY' sign further down the street.

As the scene progresses, the cone and green equipment on the far left exit the frame, and a man in a dark jacket enters the mid-ground left of the sidewalk, walking towards the viewer. Simultaneously, the yellow taxi in the right background moves further away, and a traffic signal to the right changes to a red 'Don't Walk' hand.

The first frame captures a city street scene from a ground-level perspective. On the left sidewalk, a man in a black jacket and glasses walks towards the viewer, slightly to the left of the center. To his left, a long building wall is covered with a series of vibrant murals. Further down the sidewalk on the right, several pedestrians walk away from the viewer, while a tall digital advertising kiosk displays a blue graphic to their right. A white police car with flashing lights is partially visible on the street to the far right, next to a traffic light pole with a "ONE WAY" sign, and bare trees are visible between the sidewalk and the street. Tall buildings define the background on both sides.
end of description
The man in the black jacket continues walking forward, passing the viewer and gradually exiting the frame to the viewer's left. Concurrently, the group of pedestrians on the right sidewalk proceeds further away down the street. In the final frames, the text "7th AVENUE" appears at the bottom left of the viewer's screen as a newly revealed informational overlay.
