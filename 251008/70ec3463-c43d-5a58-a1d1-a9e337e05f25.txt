As the frames progress, the camera moves forward, tracking the central figure, causing the foreground left figure to move out of view to the left. A decorative gold plaque bearing "1486" on the right building's facade is newly revealed further along the wall. The street to the left and pedestrians ahead become increasingly visible.

In the first frame, a person in a grey hooded jacket and backpack, carrying two black bags, walks away from the viewer on a city sidewalk. To the right, a building with a decorative dark awning, displaying 'MACY'S' above it, runs along the sidewalk, featuring two fire hydrants near the bottom right. On the left, a large planter separates the sidewalk from a red-paved street, beyond which are tall buildings with advertising, including 'FOREVER 21', under an overcast sky.
end of description
The primary individual in the foreground continues walking away from the viewer, progressively revealing more of the sidewalk and the street to the left. Other pedestrians on the sidewalk also move or adjust their positions. A dark red SUV appears on the street to the left and drives past the planter towards the right side of the frame.

This sidewalk is covered by a dark, ornate awning extending from a building on the right, and across the red-laned street to the left, tall buildings with illuminated signs like "FOREVER 21" are visible.
end of description
As the video progresses, the two women in the foreground continue walking past the viewer towards the left, eventually exiting the frame from the lower left. The man with the shopping bags proceeds further away from the viewer down the sidewalk. A white car also emerges in the background, driving from left to right on the red street lane.

In the immediate foreground, a person in a grey hooded jacket with a backpack carries two black bags, walking away from the viewer, while a person in a long black coat walks to their left, also moving forward. To the far left, a brown planter is partially visible, leading to a bustling sidewalk further ahead with numerous pedestrians. Parallel to the sidewalk is a street with a distinct red bus lane and a grey traffic lane, where a white car is seen driving away from the viewer, with towering city buildings and large digital advertisements like "FOREVER 21" in the background.
end of description
As the video progresses, the foreground figures continue walking away from the viewer, revealing more of the street ahead. The white car on the street moves further into the distance, and a dark sedan subsequently appears and drives away from the viewer in the same lane. The "BUS" marking on the red lane becomes more clearly visible as objects in front of it move away.

The first frame presents a city sidewalk viewed looking down a street lined with buildings, including one displaying 'Forever 21', and a red bus lane to the left. A dark, ornate awning extends over the right side, shading several people standing near a building with red accents. Numerous pedestrians occupy the sidewalk, with a central group featuring a woman and child walking away from the viewer.
end of description
As frames advance, this central group progresses further away down the sidewalk. Simultaneously, a dark SUV enters the red bus lane from the left, moving across the frame behind the initial group of pedestrians, while other individuals on the sidewalk also shift their positions.

The first frame displays a street scene with a wide sidewalk on the right and a street with a red lane on the left. On the right, a building facade with red accents and ornate awnings extends into the mid-ground, with several pedestrians standing or walking near it. On the sidewalk, closer to the viewer and left of center, a woman in a cream jacket walks towards the viewer, followed by a man in a black jacket and jeans. Further away, towards the center and walking away from the viewer, are a woman in a long black coat holding hands with a child in a purple jacket, and a man with a backpack to their right. In the mid-ground on the left, traffic moves along the street, bordered by buildings with billboards, including one for "FOREVER 21". Tall skyscrapers are visible in the background under an overcast sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the woman in the cream jacket and the man in the black jacket continue walking towards and then past the viewer from the left side of the frame. Simultaneously, the woman in the black coat, the child in the purple jacket, and the man with the backpack continue walking further into the background, away from the viewer. As the foreground pedestrians move, a small white dog on a leash and a girl in a striped scarf emerge from the far left of the frame, walking towards the viewer. Vehicles continue to move along the street to the left, while pedestrians near the store facade on the right shift their positions slightly.

The first frame displays a bustling city street scene from a pedestrian's perspective. In the immediate foreground to the left, a person wearing a blue beanie and a striped scarf, with a dark coat, is partially visible, holding an object. A tall, dark pole with a decorative top stands just to their left. To the left of the sidewalk, a red-marked lane carries traffic, with a silver SUV driving away from the viewer into the mid-distance. The right side of the frame features an ornate building facade with a decorative awning and red-framed windows, extending into the background.

In the distant left background, tall city buildings are adorned with large digital billboards, including "FOREVER 21" and "MALUMA".

Throughout the subsequent frames, the person in the blue beanie and striped scarf in the immediate foreground walks forward, gradually moving past the left edge of the frame. The silver SUV on the red-marked lane continues driving away from the viewer, moving deeper into the left background. Most other pedestrians, including the group in the mid-right, also continue walking away from the viewer along the street. A new woman in a white beanie, holding a phone and a patterned bag, emerges from behind and to the left of the initial foreground figure, walking towards the viewer.
