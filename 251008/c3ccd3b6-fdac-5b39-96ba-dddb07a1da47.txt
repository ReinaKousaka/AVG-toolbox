The first frame depicts a bustling city street extending away from the viewer, flanked by buildings on both sides. A rack of blue rental bicycles is prominent in the foreground left, while parked cars line the right side of the street, beside a building adorned with lights and storefronts. Pedestrians populate both sidewalks and the crosswalk in the mid-ground, with a dense urban skyline and bright signs visible in the distant background.

end of description
A white car in the distant background drives forward towards the viewer, becoming more visible centrally. Concurrently, pedestrians on the mid-ground sidewalks and crosswalk dynamically shift positions, and a person with a stroller slowly traverses the street from right to left in the mid-ground.
