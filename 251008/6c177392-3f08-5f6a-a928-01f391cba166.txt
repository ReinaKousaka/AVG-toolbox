The first frame presents a paved road with a yellow center line curving towards the left, bordered by a green guardrail on its left and a wooden fence adjacent to a rocky, tree-covered slope on its right. Beyond the guardrail, a body of water and a multi-story building with a red roof are visible, nestled against a large mountain under a clear blue sky.

As the viewpoint progresses forward along the road, the guardrail and wooden fence recede, continuously revealing more of the autumn-foliaged mountain slope to the right. Concurrently, a tall, colorful pole adorned with a solar panel structure appears from behind the left guardrail, becoming increasingly prominent and moving closer to the viewer.
