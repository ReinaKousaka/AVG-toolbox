The first frame displays a city intersection with a zebra crossing prominent in the center; a white building with air conditioning units and a notice board occupies the left foreground, while a building with a green awning and a light-colored door is in the right foreground, and a dark van is partially visible mid-left, near the crossing.
end of description
The dark van proceeds left across the intersection and exits the frame. A yellow taxi and then a dark vehicle subsequently appear from the right, crossing the intersection from right to left, with a red traffic light becoming visible above the intersection to the right. Finally, a white car enters the intersection from the right, following the preceding vehicles as they continue moving left out of the scene.

The first frame presents a street intersection with a crosswalk in the foreground, various multi-story buildings across the street in the background, and numerous overhead wires; a yellow taxi and a black van are stationary on the left, while a white car crosses the street from right to left in the midground.
end of description
The white car continues moving left and exits the scene, as the black van on the left also progresses forward. Subsequently, a black SUV enters the frame from the right, moving left across the intersection. This black SUV proceeds left while the initial black van exits to the left. Finally, a second black van-like vehicle appears from the right, trailing the first black SUV as both continue moving left across the intersection.

In the first frame, a street intersection is seen under an overcast sky. A black SUV drives left across a crosswalk in the mid-ground, while a black minivan is parked further right. To the left, a utility pole with a traffic light and street sign stands beside multi-story buildings. On the right, shops with a pink facade are visible on the ground floor of a building complex, with overhead wires crisscrossing the entire scene.
end of description
The black SUV continues moving left and exits the frame. Subsequently, a white scooter enters from the right, crossing the intersection leftwards, as a pedestrian with a bicycle appears on the far left sidewalk, moving towards the viewer. Finally, a dark blue hatchback car enters from the right, following the path of the scooter across the intersection.

The first frame captures a street scene featuring a masked person on the far left sidewalk, a black hatchback followed by a white hatchback driving rightward across a crosswalk, and utility poles with a green traffic light and street sign on the left. Buildings, including a multi-story brown structure with a pink storefront on the right, line the street under an overcast sky, with a distant antenna tower visible in the background.
end of description
Both cars continue moving right across the crosswalk, exiting the frame rightward as the traffic light on the far right building changes from green to amber, then to red. Subsequently, a small white van behind the left utility pole becomes more visible as the path ahead clears.
