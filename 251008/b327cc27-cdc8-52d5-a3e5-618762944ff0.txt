The first frame depicts a wet city street from a forward-moving perspective, with a blue SUV and a silver car prominent in the immediate right foreground, while a pink and green van is parked on the far left. A line of cars and multiple motorcycles extend into the midground, flanked by ornate buildings and trees on the left, leading to distant skyscrapers under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the blue SUV, silver car, and the line of parked cars on the right to gradually exit the frame behind the viewer. Simultaneously, the pink and green van and the buildings on the left recede behind the viewer, revealing more of the street ahead. New vehicles appear from the distant background, moving towards and then past the original first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
In the first frame, a multi-lane road stretches forward, with the viewer seemingly positioned within a vehicle. To the viewer's immediate left, a person on a motorcycle is present, followed by a row of shops/buildings and trees extending into the mid-ground. To the right, a line of stationary cars in traffic occupies a separate lane, with a white truck bearing "ICE" further down the queue and a concrete wall/barrier behind them. In the background, tall high-rise buildings dominate the right skyline, under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The motorcycle on the left gradually moves past the buildings, revealing new sections of the roadside. The stationary vehicles in the right lane appear to shift position relative to the viewer, with the white truck bearing "ICE" becoming more prominent and closer. New portions of the road ahead and the buildings on the left become visible as the camera advances.

In the first frame, a multi-lane road stretches into the distance, with a person on a motorcycle positioned in the lower-left, next to a tree-lined sidewalk and multi-story buildings. To the right, a white truck with 'ICE' written on its side is visible, followed by a dark-colored car, both next to a raised curb separating them from a line of other parked vehicles. Tall skyscrapers dominate the distant background under a hazy sky.
end of description
The white truck and the black car on the right move forward and out of frame, revealing a clearer view of the line of stationary parked cars behind them, previously obscured to the right of the first-frame viewpoint. A blue circular sign, initially behind the white truck, becomes fully visible on the right as vehicles advance past it. The overall scene indicates the viewer's position is also moving forward, causing the buildings and trees on the left to recede.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a multi-lane city road extending into the distance under a hazy sky. To the left, a row of multi-story buildings with storefronts and trees lines a sidewalk, where a motorcyclist and a silver van are positioned. To the right, a striped curb separates the road from a line of parked cars, behind which stand modern buildings and several towering skyscrapers, including a prominent slender one in the far background.
end of description
As the viewer slowly moves forward, the motorcyclist and silver van on the left side of the road advance further ahead into the distance. Concurrently, on the right, the black sedan and white SUV nearest the viewer also shift forward relative to the initial viewpoint, indicating a continuous, slow progression along the street.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
A multi-lane road extends into the hazy distance, flanked by multi-story buildings and trees on the left, and a striped median separating parked cars from the main thoroughfare on the right, with towering skyscrapers in the background.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the buildings on the left approach, and the motorcycle on the left continues moving away from the viewer. Subsequently, more motorcycles and a white car emerge and advance from behind the parked vehicles on the right, moving into and then past the right side of the original frame.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A multi-lane city street extends forward under an overcast sky, bordered by buildings and lush trees. On the immediate left, a blue-painted building with a Malaysian flag and a silver SUV are visible, while numerous cars and motorcycles populate the road, separated by a central divider on the right.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer's perspective advances along the street. The blue building and Malaysian flag on the left recede, making way for a prominent, illuminated "Kopitiam" sign that emerges and then moves past the viewer. Simultaneously, vehicles on both sides flow forward, and a red car appears on the far right near construction barriers, further revealing the urban landscape ahead.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a wide city street looking forward, with a covered walkway and trees lining the left side, and a striped curb with a lamppost and more trees on the right. Cars and motorcycles occupy both sides of the road, including a white car mid-right and a distant bus centrally, all against a backdrop of tall city buildings under a hazy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the prominent white car initially mid-right shifts further right and disappears from view, replaced by a dark SUV and motorcycles behind it approaching the viewer on the right side of the road. Concurrently, a silver SUV previously further down the left lane moves closer to the viewer, while the lamppost on the right side also approaches before exiting the frame to the right. This forward progression reveals more of the buildings further down the street on the left, and causes the construction barriers on the far right to gradually exit the frame.
