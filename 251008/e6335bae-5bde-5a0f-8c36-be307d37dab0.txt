To the viewer's immediate left stands a grey utility building on a concrete base amidst a vibrant green grassy slope, partially secured by a green mesh fence. A paved road curves from the lower center towards the right, leading into the mid-ground. An orange triangular warning sign with an exclamation mark is positioned on the right edge of the road, next to some exposed earth, while a metal guardrail is further right. Beyond the road, a dense forest covers a steep hillside to the right, and a vast green pasture with rocky outcrops rises sharply to the left. Distant mountains shrouded in mist and clouds dominate the background, with power lines visible high up on the right.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the grey building on the left recedes and moves out of frame to the viewer's left. The orange warning sign and disturbed earth, initially to the right of the immediate path, shift past the viewer's position to the lower left. The road ahead curves further to the right, revealing more of the grassy hillside and forest, with a new wooden utility pole emerging into view on the left slope.
