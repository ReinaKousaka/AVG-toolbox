The first frame depicts a bustling, rain-slicked temple courtyard featuring a low red building with banners and "Omikuji" signs on the left, and a large red multi-tiered temple structure on the right, all under a hazy sky with a distant tower visible. Numerous pedestrians, almost all holding umbrellas, are dispersed across the grey tiled plaza, some queuing at the left building and others walking towards or away from the viewer.

Throughout the subsequent frames, a man in a grey jacket and green pants walks from the mid-left towards the mid-right, passing closer to the viewer. Other individuals, mainly to the right of the man, also continue their slow movement across the wet plaza from the mid-ground towards the viewer. The surrounding buildings remain fixed from the first-frame viewpoint.
