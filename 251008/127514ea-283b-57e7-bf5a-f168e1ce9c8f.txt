A dilapidated two-story building with mixed materials occupies the left and center, partially obscured by a green chain-link fence in front of it. To the right, a utility pole with a yellow "Times Parking" sign stands beside an asphalt street curving away, while the foreground features pavement with long shadows.

From frame three onwards, the front-left portion of a white vehicle emerges at the far left edge, closest to the viewer. This vehicle continues moving slowly rightward, progressively revealing more of itself on the left side of the scene through subsequent frames.

The first frame displays an asphalt ground in the foreground with elongated shadows and a yellow arrow marking visible on the right. A green chain-link fence horizontally spans the mid-ground, separating the viewer from a two-story, dilapidated building behind it, constructed from various materials like wood and corrugated metal. To the right of the building, a yellow "Times Parking" sign with a left-pointing arrow is situated above a larger yellow sign detailing parking rates. A utility pole with multiple wires stands to the far right, with other urban buildings extending into the background under a clear blue sky.

No significant dynamic changes or newly revealed objects are discernible across the subsequent frames.

The first frame displays an asphalt ground with an orange arrow pointing right, overlaid by shadows. Across the mid-foreground, a green chain-link fence stretches horizontally, behind which stands a two-story dilapidated building constructed from varied materials like corrugated metal and wood. The building, occupying most of the background, features multiple windows and balconies. To the right, a utility pole with overhead wires is visible, bearing a yellow "Times Parking" sign pointing left, while a large yellow and red parking information sign is affixed to the building/fence below it. Farther to the right in the background, other buildings and a street are dimly seen, all beneath a clear blue sky.
end of description
Over the subsequent frames, the camera slowly moves to the right relative to the initial viewpoint. This movement progressively reveals more of the dilapidated building's left facade, which was partially out of frame initially. Concurrently, objects on the right side, specifically the utility pole and the "Times Parking" sign, shift further towards the frame's right edge, appearing to leave the scene. By the final frames, a small white rectangular instruction sign on the leftmost green fence panel, previously partially obscured by a fence post, becomes fully visible to the viewer's left. The shadows cast across the asphalt foreground also subtly shift position from left to right.
