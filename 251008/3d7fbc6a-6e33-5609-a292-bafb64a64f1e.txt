The first frame depicts a snow-covered path extending from the viewer's immediate foreground into the distance, flanked by snow-laden pine trees on the left and a rising snow-covered hillside with rocky outcrops on the right. Ahead on the path, a person in a yellow jacket and blue pants walks away from the viewer, followed by another in a blue jacket slightly further ahead, with faint figures visible in the far distance; a red-marked wooden pole stands mid-ground to the right of the path.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the path, causing the individuals ahead to recede further from the first-frame viewpoint. The red-marked wooden pole on the right approaches the viewer and then eventually exits the frame to the right, revealing more of the snow-covered hillside that was previously behind it.
