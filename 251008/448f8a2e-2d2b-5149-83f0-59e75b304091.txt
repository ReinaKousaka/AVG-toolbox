The first frame reveals a flagstone pavement in the foreground leading to a grand traditional East Asian gate structure in the midground, characterized by red pillars, red-brown walls, and ornate colorful eaves, flanked by two white cylindrical markers. Through the gate's wide central opening, a smaller, multi-tiered building is visible further back, beyond which hazy mountains stretch across the distant horizon.

A person in dark attire first appears on the raised platform inside the gate, to the right of the central path, then walks left across the opening and enters the archway on the viewer's left. Simultaneously, another person becomes visible near the distant building, also moving from right to left relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Both individuals eventually pass out of view to the left within the complex.

The first frame shows the viewer positioned on a wide, light-colored stone-paved ground looking towards a grand architectural structure. Immediately in front, several wide stone steps lead up to a large red gate building, which has three visible openings framed by red pillars and ornate colorful eaves. Through the central opening, a distant multi-tiered, dark-roofed traditional building is visible, with hazy mountains behind it. To the left of the steps, a stone railing with a decorative animal at its base is present, while a patterned lantern-like object rests on the stone ground to the right of the steps. People are sparsely visible within the gate structure: one person walks away on the far left, and a small group stands in the central opening.

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint slowly moves forward and slightly upward towards the steps and the gate structure. The decorative lantern on the bottom right of the initial view gradually exits the frame as the camera advances. Concurrently, a new individual holding a white umbrella walks from the far left of the gate's left opening across the path, while the initial person continues moving further left. The group within the central gate opening also shifts slightly, with one person raising a white umbrella. The ground inside the gate appears consistently wet.

In the first frame, three large stone steps lead up to a wet, paved stone floor bordered by dark red wooden pillars and open doors of an archway. Beyond the archway, a distant traditional building with tiered roofs stands slightly right of center, with a group of people, one holding a white umbrella, visible to its left.

end of description

The viewer moves forward and upward, ascending the steps and entering the archway, causing the steps to disappear from the bottom of the frame and the wet, paved floor to dominate. The red pillars pass on either side, and the distant building and the group of people with the umbrella ahead become larger and more defined, revealing more of the wet ground and surrounding structures beyond the archway relative to the initial viewpoint.
