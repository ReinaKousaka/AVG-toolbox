The first frame displays a long, irregular stone staircase ascending towards the viewer's top-center, bordered by green bushes and bamboo handrails on both sides. At the top of these stairs, a red and dark-colored structure is partially visible, while two small animals, one dark and one light, are positioned on the upper steps. end of description. As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward and upward along the staircase. Both the dark and light animals move further up the stairs, eventually disappearing from view at the top. The red structure at the top of the stairs becomes more prominent before receding slightly as the camera continues its ascent.

A stone staircase ascends from the viewer towards a bright sky, flanked by green bamboo railings and lush foliage on both sides. Bare trees are visible in the far background to the left, and a dark wooden structure appears at the top right beyond the stairs.
end of description
The camera slowly ascends the staircase, gradually revealing more of the landing at the top. A small, grey, furry animal then emerges from behind the right railing, moving towards the top-center of the stairs, and a light-colored building becomes visible behind the landing.

In the foreground, grey stone steps with irregular shapes ascend directly away from the viewer. A green bamboo handrail extends from the bottom-left to the top-center along the left side, paralleling the steps, with lush green foliage and bushes below it. A similar bamboo handrail mirrors this on the right side, extending from the bottom-right towards the top-center, also bordered by greenery. At the top of the stairs in the background, a building with large windows is visible under a cloudy sky, partially obscured by sparse trees and the upper railing sections.
end of description
The camera gradually moves forward and slightly upward, ascending the stone steps. This motion causes the central stone steps, initially further away, to progressively advance towards and pass beyond the original first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the bamboo railings on both sides appear to lower relative to the frame, revealing more of their structure that was initially below the first-frame's direct line of sight. The building at the top of the stairs, positioned in the background of the initial frame, subtly becomes larger and incrementally closer to the first-frame viewpoint. No new objects are introduced; the scene primarily changes due to the shifting camera perspective.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A path of large, dark grey stone steps leads upwards and away from the viewer in the foreground, flanked by bamboo railings and green foliage on both sides. At the top of these steps, a paved area extends towards a modern building with large glass windows reflecting the sky, situated centrally in the background. To the right of the steps, a reddish wooden structure is partially visible behind some rocks and greenery.

end of description

From the fifth frame, a person wearing a light top and dark pants gradually emerges from behind the rock formation and reddish structure to the right of the paved area, at the top of the stone steps. They appear facing the viewer. Over the subsequent frames, this person steps onto the paved path and moves further left and slightly closer to the viewer, approaching the top of the steps.
