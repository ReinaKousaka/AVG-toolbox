The first frame presents a narrow urban alley extending forward from the viewer's perspective. On the immediate left is a "WINE BAR" with a black facade, a yellow awning, and two red chairs with a wooden table outside. To the right, a white building with a glass storefront and awning is visible. Two men are walking away from the viewer down the green-paved alley towards distant buildings, overhead wires, and decorative string lights.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective advances steadily down the alley. The two men move further into the distance, while the "WINE BAR" and its outdoor seating recede and eventually exit the frame to the left. The continuous forward movement reveals more of the alley's length and the buildings further ahead on both sides.

First, a narrow alleyway extends into the distance under an overcast sky. To the immediate left, an open storefront with a yellow awning displays bottles and has two red chairs and a black table outside; to the right, a white building with a dark awning partially obscures a window. Two people walk away from the viewer down the greenish-gray brick-paved alley, flanked by buildings on both sides. end of description. The camera slowly moves forward, causing the two walkers to recede further down the alley and the foreground buildings to pass out of view, revealing more of the alley's depth.

The first frame depicts a narrow urban alleyway paved with greenish-gray bricks, extending away from the viewer into the distance. To the immediate left, a dark cabinet with several bottles sits near the bottom, with a red chair partially visible below it, next to a building featuring large windows and a bright yellow awning overhead. To the right, a plain white tiled building wall occupies the frame's side. Two people are seen walking away from the viewer down the alley, towards the background where more buildings and utility wires are visible under an overcast sky.
end of description
The camera smoothly moves forward down the alley, causing the red chair and cabinet on the left to gradually exit the frame as the viewpoint advances past them. As the viewer progresses, more of the storefronts and signs along the left building, beneath the yellow awning, become visible. The two pedestrians continue walking further away into the distance relative to the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the buildings and overhead wires in the alley's background approach the viewer, increasing in size within the frame.

The first frame captures a narrow alleyway with light green pavers receding into the distance. A yellow awning and a white circular sign with Korean text are prominent on the left, while a plain white wall, pipes, and some refuse are on the right, with two individuals walking away in the midground.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward through the alley, the two individuals recede further into the distance, and the buildings on both sides draw closer to the viewer. The circular sign on the left and the red sign on the right move out of view as the viewpoint passes them, revealing more of the path ahead.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a narrow, green-paved alley lined with buildings; a yellow awning and a '수련집' sign are prominently on the left, while a white building with a '회' sign and a yellow door stands on the right. Three people walk ahead of the viewer into the alley's midground, past a glass-fronted shop on the left and a parked scooter on the right.
end of description
As the camera moves forward into the alley, the initial foreground objects on both sides recede out of view. The three people continue further down the alley, and the previously midground sections of the alley, including more shops and building facades, are progressively revealed ahead of the original first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a narrow paved alleyway stretching into the distance, flanked by buildings under an overcast sky. To the left, a building with large glass windows and a black awning has potted plants near the viewer. On the right, a white building displays a red Korean sign (화) above an open yellow door, with two stacked dark chairs and a utility pole further down this side. Several people walk away from the viewer deeper into the alley, and a scooter is parked further along the right side on the light-colored pavers.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward into the alley, causing the open yellow door on the right to further reveal a shop's interior with a person behind a counter and posters inside, while the walking individuals and the parked scooter recede further into the distance relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a narrow, paved alleyway receding into the distance under a pale sky. To the immediate left, a storefront with large glass windows and a black awning is visible, with a white planter containing green foliage positioned in the midground. On the right, a light-colored wall appears closest to the viewer, followed by a grey utility pole plastered with stickers, a small wooden table, and two dark chairs. Further ahead in the alley's midground, a white scooter is parked on the right, and a small group of people walks away from the viewer towards the background, flanked by buildings with various signs and awnings.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the alley. Objects initially on the viewer's immediate left, like the storefront and planter, and on the immediate right, such as the wall and utility pole, gradually shift to the sides and then *behind* the first-frame viewpoint. The white scooter and table on the right also move further *to the right* and then *behind* the initial position. Consequently, new sections of the alley, including additional building facades, overhead wires, an air conditioning unit, and more illuminated signs, are continuously revealed *further ahead* in the path relative to the first-frame perspective.
