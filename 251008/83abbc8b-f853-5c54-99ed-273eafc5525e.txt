In the first frame, a paved two-lane road stretches directly away from the viewer, featuring a solid white line on the right shoulder and double solid yellow lines delineating lanes to the left. A lone cyclist, wearing a white jersey, is visible in the middle distance, riding away from the viewer on the right side of the road. To the left, a steep, dark, rocky embankment with patches of snow and dense evergreen trees rises, while a less steep, brown, dirt and rock embankment with sparse green vegetation lines the right side. An overcast sky is visible above the distant treeline and hills.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, following the cyclist who recedes further into the distance. The road and its markings, along with the adjacent embankments, continuously advance towards and past the viewer. The patches of snow on the left embankment gradually appear less prominent as the forward movement continues, revealing more of the rocky and forested terrain previously in the middle ground.

The first frame captures a paved mountain road stretching forward, featuring a cyclist ahead of the viewer on the right side near the white line. To the left is a forested slope with snow patches, while a rocky incline rises to the right; in the far distance, a gate and another faint cyclist are visible on the road.
end of description
As frames progress, the initial cyclist moves further away from the first-frame viewpoint, steadily pedaling down the road. A second cyclist, initially a faint object further ahead on the road, becomes progressively clearer and closer to the gate, still remaining ahead of the first cyclist relative to the original viewpoint. Both cyclists continue receding into the distance towards the gate, remaining within the road scene ahead of the original viewpoint.
