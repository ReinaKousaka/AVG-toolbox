The first frame presents a narrow asphalt road winding uphill, flanked on the left by a hedge partially obscuring a white house, and on the right by a prominent dark stone wall. Further up the road on the right, a blue van is parked beside another smaller stone wall, with a tree-covered hillside and cloudy sky in the background.

As the viewer progresses, the right stone wall recedes, revealing a dark green garage door and a large white house situated higher on the hillside, both appearing to the right of the original viewpoint. Concurrently, the blue van is passed, shifting left in the frame, while more of the white house on the left becomes visible.

In the first frame, an asphalt road stretches forward, curving slightly left into the distance. A vibrant green hedge runs along the road's left side, with part of a white house visible behind it in the mid-left. On the right, a blue minivan is parked adjacent to a stone wall with black metal fencing, behind which a gate and a sign are partially visible. A steep, tree-covered hillside rises in the background on the right, topped by a distant white house, all under a partially cloudy blue sky. Digital overlays display speed, grade, and distance in the top right.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the blue minivan on the right exits the frame, revealing the full sign behind it. The road ahead, which was previously unseen, becomes more prominent, showing a continued gentle curve to the left. The hedge on the left and the stone wall/fence on the right extend further into view from the bottom, while the white house on the far left becomes slightly more visible as the viewer approaches. The distant white house on the hillside remains visible but appears slightly further away as the perspective shifts.
