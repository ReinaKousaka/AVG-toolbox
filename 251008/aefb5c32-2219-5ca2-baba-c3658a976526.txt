The first frame depicts a wide street extending into the distance, lined on both sides by multi-story buildings under an overcast sky. On the left, several vehicles are parked along a sidewalk featuring pedestrians, shops, and streetlights adorned with red banners. In the two-lane road ahead, a dark gray SUV and a silver sedan are visible moving away, with a blue bus further in the distance. To the right, a building with a red facade and "平常人饭店" sign stands beside a sidewalk where a lone person is visible, against a backdrop of distant mountains.
end of description
From the second frame onwards, the dark gray SUV and silver sedan continuously move further away from the first-frame viewpoint, receding down the road. Orange traffic cones progressively appear on the left side of the road, extending from the middle ground towards the foreground relative to the initial viewpoint. A pedestrian on the right sidewalk, initially near the red building, walks further down the street away from the first-frame viewpoint. Additional pedestrians also appear and move on both sidewalks. The entire scene subtly shifts forward, suggesting the viewer's perspective is advancing down the street, causing road markings to pass by the original viewpoint's location.

The first frame displays a multi-lane city road receding into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings adorned with red banners and traditional lanterns on streetlights, leading towards mountains visible in the background under an overcast sky. On the road, a dark SUV is positioned in front of a blue bus in the left lane, while a silver car occupies the right lane; a person walks forward on the right sidewalk.
end of description
The dark SUV in the left lane moves forward, progressively exiting the frame towards the left foreground. Concurrently, the blue bus advances significantly closer to the viewer, now dominating the left side of the road, while the silver car in the right lane also moves forward. The person on the right sidewalk continues walking ahead, gradually moving further to the right foreground relative to the viewer's static position.

A city street view shows a large green and blue bus on the left foreground, with a silver sedan and white SUV driving ahead in the mid-ground. Parked cars line the left curb, while decorative street lamps with red Chinese flags flank both sides of the road, leading towards multi-story buildings and distant mountains under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the green and blue bus exits the left foreground by frame 5. The cars ahead recede, and the street lamps and a white SUV from the parked lane on the far left pass by the viewer, revealing more of the street and buildings in the distance.

The first frame depicts a city street extending into the distance, lined by multi-story buildings on both the left and right, with mountains in the far background under an overcast sky. In the foreground, a white SUV is on the left, an arrow marks the road, and several cars and a motorbike are further ahead, while streetlights adorned with red Chinese flags decorate the route.
end of description
The foreground white SUV on the left moves forward, gradually exiting the frame to the left, while other vehicles in the midground also advance further down the street away from the viewer. A pedestrian subsequently appears on the right sidewalk in the midground and walks towards the viewer, as the overall viewpoint subtly shifts forward.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a street scene with a pedestrian crossing directly in front of the viewer. To the left, a tall building with various windows and a red-toned section is visible, with a red car partially in view on the far left. On the right, a sidewalk borders the road, with a woman and child standing near a pedestrian crossing sign. Multiple cars are present in the middle distance, driving away from the viewer down the street. Decorative street lamps adorned with red Chinese flags line both sides of the road, extending into the background where more buildings and mountains are visible under an overcast sky.
end of description
From the second frame, the red car on the left and the two pedestrians on the right sidewalk begin moving forward relative to the viewer's fixed position. The red car advances across the pedestrian crossing, eventually moving past the initial viewpoint and exiting the frame to the far left by the fifth frame. Concurrently, the two pedestrians walk forward, gradually exiting the frame to the right. Following the red car, a silver car, initially positioned further back on the left, moves progressively closer to the viewpoint, then another silver car takes its place, followed by a light blue vehicle that also advances towards the foreground from the left.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a street extending into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings and ornate street lamps displaying red Chinese flags. On the far left, a red car is parked, and a silver car in the left lane is moving away from the viewer, with other vehicles further down the road and mountains visible in the hazy background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the silver car moves further away from the viewer to the left. The red parked car on the far left is gradually replaced by a row of white parked cars that appear closer to the viewer. A white SUV then enters from the bottom-left, moving forward in the left lane towards the background, while the overall viewpoint slowly advances, revealing more of the road ahead.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a street scene looking forward down a multi-lane road under an overcast sky. On the left, a tall building with a red and white facade lines the street, with several cars (white, silver, black) parked alongside it. On the right, a sidewalk features a tall pole adorned with two red Chinese flags, a blue pedestrian crossing sign, and a red hexagonal stop sign, leading to multi-story buildings, some appearing unfinished. Mountains, partially obscured by clouds, are visible in the far background, beyond the buildings. In the mid-distance, a black van and other cars are visible on the road, driving away from the viewer.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The red stop sign and the blue pedestrian crossing sign on the right side of the road gradually shift out of the frame to the right. A black sedan, initially parked on the far left, begins to move forward as the viewer progresses. Vehicles further down the road, including the black van, continue to recede into the distance, revealing more of the street and buildings.
