To the viewer's immediate left, a storefront with large windows displays LG advertisements, fronted by several stacked white air conditioning units. On the immediate right, a tall blue sign with Korean text and a single white AC unit are visible, with numerous tangled wires overhead. The alley recedes into the background, where closed metal shutters and green bags are present.
end of description.
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward into the alley. The initial LG units on the left and the blue sign on the right recede from view, while the alley's path ahead, the cluttered overhead wires on the right wall, and the distant green bags progressively appear closer and more central within the frame.

The first frame shows a narrow, dark alleyway at night. To the immediate right, stacked air conditioning units are visible, while further along the right wall are tangled wires, electrical boxes, and various signs, including a prominent blue one. On the left, a brightly lit storefront with large glass panels reflects light, and a building with closed metal roll-down shutters is further back, with two green garbage bags resting in front of it. The alley recedes into darkness in the distance.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward into the alley. The air conditioning units on the immediate right progressively move out of frame, revealing more of the right-hand wall and a gray door with horizontal colored stripes. On the left, a new orange sign becomes clearly visible within the illuminated storefront's interior. The green garbage bags and the shuttered building on the left appear closer to the viewer, while the alley's deep background shows slightly more detail as the camera advances.

The first frame shows a narrow, dimly lit alley at night, with a wet, reflective ground stretching into the background. To the viewer's immediate left, two large, bulging green sacks rest on the ground in the foreground. Along the left side, a brightly lit shop with glass doors is visible, followed by several storefronts with closed, horizontally striped metal roller shutters, topped by various blue and white Korean signs. On the right, a building with a metal gate and more striped roller shutters (yellow, red, blue) is present, with an air conditioning unit attached below. The alley recedes into darkness in the background, with overhead wires crisscrossing.

end of description

The viewpoint steadily advances forward into the alley, causing objects to appear closer and then recede past the viewer's position. The two green sacks on the left move from the foreground towards the midground and then out of the immediate frame to the viewer's left. The closed storefronts and their striped roller shutters on both sides become more detailed and fill a larger portion of the frame as the camera approaches and then passes them. An air conditioning unit on the right and a green utility box on the left appear and then recede from view. Further into the alley, a streetlamp becomes more prominent in the background, and additional signs on the buildings emerge from the increasing illumination.

The first frame shows a narrow, wet alley at night, bordered by buildings with closed roller shutters. To the viewer's immediate left are several light green garbage bags, while the right features an outdoor air conditioning unit and various signs hanging above. end of description. Subsequent frames reveal a subtle camera pan right, gradually exposing a red fire extinguisher box on the right wall, initially at the far right edge above the air conditioner, and new red signage appearing higher up the same wall, maintaining their positions relative to the original right side.

A narrow, wet alleyway stretches ahead, illuminated by a single streetlamp in the midground. To the left, a closed storefront with horizontal yellow, red, and blue stripes has a pile of dirty snow at its base, topped by a blue sign with Korean text ("유진애드프린팅"). To the right, another closed storefront with light tan and red stripes displays a prominent red sign with Korean text and two red fire extinguishers mounted on the wall; above it, a large yellow sign ("숙성 하정 전문 전광 스티커") and a smaller blue sign ("마스타") are visible. The background shows more darkened buildings and faint signs deeper in the alley.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward into the alley, the storefronts on both sides become more prominent and the fire extinguisher sign on the right recedes out of frame. The yellow and blue signs on the right move higher and partially out of the top right, while a new blue and white sign and another green/white sign become visible further down the alley on the right. The streetlamp and reflections on the wet ground shift, revealing more of the dark, narrow path ahead.

The first frame displays a narrow, wet alleyway at night, lined with closed shopfronts; the one on the left features a corrugated metal shutter with red, yellow, and blue stripes, while the right has a similar shutter with red stripes. A pile of snow or slush is visible at the bottom left, and a blue-green vertical sign with Korean text ("마스타") stands further down the right wall, with another blue sign partially obscured on the left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward into the alley. The blue-green "마스타" sign on the right approaches the viewer and shifts rightward, revealing more of the reddish-orange building facade and an awning behind it. Concurrently, the snow pile on the bottom left also draws closer as the camera advances deeper into the alley.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a dark, wet alleyway at night, flanked by closed shops. On the left, a shop features a horizontally striped metal shutter, with snow on the ground near its base, next to another with a plain gray shutter and a beige awning. On the right, a brick-textured building houses a shop with a metal door and a striped awning.
end of description
The subsequent frames show a continuous forward movement through the alley. As the viewpoint advances, the initial foreground elements recede, and the wet pavement reflections shift. The shops lining both sides of the alley progressively become closer, revealing more details of their facades and signage deeper within the narrow passage.
