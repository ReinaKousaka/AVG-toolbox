The first frame captures a wet, dark street at night, extending away from the viewer. In the foreground and mid-ground, a rain-slicked asphalt road with reflective yellow markings stretches forward, reflecting overhead streetlights. To the left of the viewer, a dark, lush area borders the road, with two cars parked further along the street. To the right, a dark brick building with a large window and some green foliage runs alongside a curb, where a visible channel of flowing water accumulates. In the distance, the street continues uphill under the glow of streetlights, with blurred trees and buildings visible. Rain is actively falling, creating visible streaks and splashes across the entire scene.

Throughout the subsequent frames, continuous heavy rain consistently falls across the entire scene, causing constant ripples and splashes on the wet road directly in front of the viewer. The reflections of streetlights on the asphalt, also directly in front, constantly shift and shimmer with the falling drops. A faint 'U' shaped road marking on the left side of the road in the foreground, initially barely visible, steadily gains clarity as if the first-frame viewpoint is subtly moving forward. Concurrently, the flow and accumulation of water in the drainage channel on the right side of the road, adjacent to the viewer, visibly intensify. A utility pole positioned in the mid-ground on the left edge of the road, relative to the first-frame viewpoint, also becomes slightly more pronounced and closer.

The first frame captures a dark, wet street at night, looking forward down a narrow path with reflective yellow lines, flanked by a brick building and a parked black car on the right, and an elevated green area with two parked cars on the left, all under the visible streaks of falling rain illuminated by a street lamp.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the scene remains largely static with no new objects or scenes revealed; the only dynamic element is the continuous, heavy rain falling across the visible area, causing subtle shifts in the reflections on the wet ground.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a wet asphalt street stretches from the viewer into the distance, marked by yellow dashed lines. To the viewer's left, a dark utility pole stands in the mid-ground, with a light-colored vehicle parked behind it and a darker one further back along a green verge. On the viewer's right, a black car is parked next to a low brick wall topped with greenery, part of a building featuring a large curved window above. A street light illuminates the road further down, revealing a tunnel-like opening created by foliage in the distance, under heavy rainfall.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the scene remains static in terms of objects, but the heavy rainfall continues dynamically. The visible streaks of falling rain intensify and lessen slightly, constantly hitting the wet ground. This creates continuous shimmering reflections on the road and occasional small splashes where raindrops make contact.
