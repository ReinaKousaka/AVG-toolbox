frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame shows the interior of a well-lit road tunnel, viewed from the perspective of moving forward. A two-lane road with white dashed lines extends directly ahead, leading into the distance. On both the left and right, white tiled walls featuring a continuous red horizontal stripe line the tunnel, meeting an arched concrete ceiling overhead, which is illuminated by evenly spaced circular lights. Towards the far end of the tunnel, a bright light marks the exit, and rectangular panels are visible on both side walls in the mid-distance.

end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves continuously forward through the tunnel. The white dashed road lines and tiled walls on both sides move from the distance towards and then past the viewer. Concurrently, the rectangular panels on the left and right walls, initially further away, gradually approach the viewer. The bright exit at the end of the tunnel appears progressively closer and larger as the viewer advances towards it.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows the interior of a long, arched tunnel, viewed from a vehicle driving straight ahead. A paved road, centered relative to the viewer, extends into the distance with two white lines defining lanes. On both sides, the tunnel walls feature white tiles with a prominent red horizontal stripe, transitioning to a darker, concrete-like arched ceiling above, all receding into the distance. Numerous lights are mounted along the upper walls/ceiling, illuminating the tunnel, and a brightly lit, circular archway is visible far ahead, marking a distant section of the tunnel.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward through the tunnel. The white-tiled walls and overhead lights continually advance towards and past the viewer, with new sections of the tunnel wall and lights appearing from the front and moving to the sides. The brightly lit archway, initially far ahead, steadily approaches the viewer, growing larger and clearer while remaining centered in the forward view, indicating continuous forward motion. The overall scene remains consistent in structure, but objects in the environment shift from ahead of the viewer to beside and behind them as the vehicle progresses deeper into the tunnel.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The viewer is inside a vehicle looking straight into a long, arched tunnel. A two-lane road extends forward from directly beneath the viewer, flanked by white tiled walls with a red stripe, illuminated by lights on the upper walls and ceiling. A prominent white semi-circular light fixture is positioned overhead, slightly ahead of the viewer, with the tunnel vanishing into the distance.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the white light arch moves overhead and recedes behind the viewer's initial position. Subsequently, large circular ventilation fans become visible on the tunnel ceiling directly ahead, approaching the viewer's original location as the vehicle moves deeper into the tunnel, revealing new sections of the wall and ceiling further along the path.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows the interior of a well-lit tunnel from a forward-looking perspective, with an arched concrete ceiling. Three large circular ventilation ducts are visible overhead, slightly to the left, while numerous lights illuminate the path along both upper walls. The walls are lined with white tiles featuring a continuous red stripe, flanking a two-lane road marked by white lines that recedes into the distance.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward through the tunnel; the overhead ventilation ducts pass above and behind the viewer. The tiled walls and lights along both sides move from being ahead to passing by the viewer's sides and eventually receding behind. A yellow signpost on the right wall, initially far ahead in the distance, grows larger and approaches the viewer's position.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a straight-ahead view inside a brightly lit, arched tunnel, featuring a gray concrete ceiling and white-tiled walls marked with a red horizontal stripe. A two-lane road with white markings extends into the distance, where green lights are visible, while various service features like lights, a blue bin, and a yellow-and-black striped barrier are positioned along the tunnel walls to the right and left, extending forward from the viewer.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily moves forward through the tunnel. Objects along the tunnel walls, such as the lights, the blue bin, and the yellow-and-black striped barrier initially seen in the mid-ground, continuously approach the viewer's position, pass by on either side, and recede behind the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows the viewer inside a well-lit tunnel, looking straight ahead down two lanes demarcated by white lines on a grey road. The tunnel's semi-circular ceiling is dark grey, while the walls below it are grey with a lower section of white rectangular tiles marked by a continuous red horizontal stripe, all receding into the distance. Numerous overhead lights illuminate the path, and far ahead on the ceiling, a series of green arrow-shaped lights are visible. In the foreground, a black and yellow striped warning marker is partially visible on the right wall.
end of description
As the vehicle progresses, the green arrow lights on the tunnel ceiling move closer and pass overhead, indicating forward motion. A digital display panel on the upper left wall, initially distant, reveals a '118' reading as it draws nearer to the left of the viewer. Subsequently, orange safety cones and a barricade appear ahead on the left side, marking what appears to be an exit or alcove. These safety markers then pass to the immediate left of the viewer, and a new red and white striped barrel-like barrier becomes visible on the right side of the road further ahead.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a long tunnel with a dark, arched ceiling and white tiled side walls featuring a continuous red stripe. Bright lights illuminate the tunnel from along the walls, revealing a two-lane road marked with white lines that extends towards a bright point in the far distance. A yellow and black checkered barrel is positioned on the far left, close to the viewer, while dark rectangular objects are visible on the right wall in the middle distance.
end of description
As the frames advance, the viewpoint moves steadily forward into the tunnel, causing the illuminated walls and ceiling details to continuously pass by on both sides. The barrel and the rectangular objects on the right wall recede and move out of the frame to the viewer's immediate left and right respectively, while the bright distant point, signaling the tunnel's end, gradually draws closer.
