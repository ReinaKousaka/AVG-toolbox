In the first frame, a man in a dark jacket walks away from the viewer, centered between two large recreational vehicles (RVs). To the viewer's left is the side of a light-colored RV with red and black accents, extending from the foreground to the midground, with "ARIA" visible. To the viewer's right is the side of a dark RV with white and gray abstract designs, also extending from the foreground to the midground, featuring a deployed awning above a window. In the background, between the RVs, palm trees and distant vehicles in a lot are visible under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The man continues walking briefly before turning to face the RV on the right, then presses a button on its side. A large panel on the right RV begins to pivot open, moving upwards and outwards from the RV's body. As it fully opens, it reveals a newly exposed outdoor entertainment system, comprising a large flat-screen television and a soundbar, recessed into the side of the RV. The man then gestures towards the now visible screen with a pleased expression.
