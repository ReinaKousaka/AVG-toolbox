The first frame shows a room with olive green walls; a dark teal credenza holding barware is centered under a bookshelf packed with books and a plant. To the credenza's right, a white fireplace mantel displays an artwork, while a partially visible wooden dining table with a red chair and striped rug is on the far right, and a floor lamp and red leather chair are partially seen on the far left.

As the frames progress, the camera subtly pans left, expanding the view of the dining area to the right of the initial viewpoint. This movement fully reveals more of the wooden dining table, a red cross-back chair, a lighter blue-grey chair, and a woven pendant light hanging above the table. Simultaneously, the lamp and red leather chair on the extreme left of the first frame gradually move further out of view.
