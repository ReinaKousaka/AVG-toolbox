The first frame shows a road curving slightly right into the distance, with a white building featuring three white stupas and two people on the left, and a green tree-covered mountain slope dominating the background and right, alongside a red-roofed building. end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the white building and stupas recede to the left, revealing more of its long white wall adorned with red text, while the red-roofed building on the right moves out of sight. Power poles and wires traverse the scene, and a white car briefly appears ahead on the left side of the road before passing. Further ahead on the right, a blue and white sign and a larger white information board with red borders become more prominent as the mountain continues to flank the right side.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a paved road curving slightly to the left, occupying the lower center. To the left of the road is a white wall with red text in both Chinese and Tibetan. On the right, green grass slopes upwards, featuring a red and white sign board in the foreground, and further back, a red building with a blue roof, a white car, and a wooden structure. Several utility poles stand along the right side of the road, which is flanked by steep, tree-covered mountains, particularly dense on the right. The sky above is a clear blue with some scattered white clouds.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the white wall with red text on the left gradually extends and then exits the frame on the left, while the red and white sign board on the right also moves out of view. A new blue sign, displaying "格塘村" (Getang Village) in Chinese, becomes fully visible to the right of the road where the previous sign was, also passing the initial right-frame position. Utility poles on the right appear closer, revealing more poles further down the road. The red building, white car, and wooden structure on the right side pass the first-frame's mid-ground, becoming more central and then receding. The mountainous valley scenery continuously unfolds, revealing more of the path ahead and deeper into the valley.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a paved road stretching into a mountain valley under a clear blue sky, flanked by steep, green-covered mountains. To the viewer's immediate left, a partial white building with red text is visible, alongside a riverbed and a white guardrail, while to the right stands a red building with a blue roof, an attached wooden structure, a silver covered car, and two motorcycles.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the initial white building on the left and the red building, covered car, and motorcycles on the right recede and eventually move behind the initial viewpoint. A pedestrian crossing appears on the road ahead of the first frame's position, and a person becomes visible on the right, near where the motorcycles were previously. Subsequently, a green sign with red text is revealed further ahead on the right.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a two-lane asphalt road stretching directly ahead, bordered on the left by a metal guardrail next to a stream and dense green bushes, and on the right by a grassy slope featuring multiple utility poles and a green informational sign with red text. Towering green mountains loom on both sides of the road, meeting a blue sky with scattered white clouds. A large, square grid-like sign post stands prominently on the mid-left side, over the guardrail.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The green informational sign, initially on the mid-right, and the square sign post, initially on the mid-left, recede towards and then past the viewer's immediate right and left, respectively, revealing more of the road and additional utility poles further down the right side of the road. Foreground elements like the guardrail and road markings continuously shift past the viewer as the mountainous valley unfolds further ahead.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a paved road stretching into the distance, bordered on the left by a white guardrail alongside a riverbed, and on the right by a grassy verge with white fence posts and a utility pole. Steep, green mountains ascend on both sides under a clear blue sky dotted with white clouds; a section of reddish-brown rock is visible on the upper right mountain slope.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses along the road, the utility pole on the right moves out of frame to the right. Simultaneously, several new trees with light green foliage emerge on the right side of the road, appearing successively larger as the viewer approaches and passes them. The guardrail and fence posts also move past the viewer to the left and right respectively, while the distant mountains seem to draw nearer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
First, a paved road leads away from the viewer towards a mountain pass, bordered on the left by a metal guardrail, a river, and a steep green mountain with power lines, and on the right by a concrete curb, grassy slope with white posts, and young green trees ascending to another mountain. A clear blue sky with white clouds stretches above the converging mountain peaks in the distance, where a small vehicle is barely visible on the road.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the white posts and trees on the right, and the guardrail and river on the left, progressively move closer and pass the viewer, appearing to recede behind. The utility pole initially on the right also moves past the viewer. The distant vehicle on the road ahead remains far, while the surrounding mountainous landscape slowly reveals more of its slopes.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a paved road extending into the distance, with a metal guardrail and rocky riverbed to the viewer's left, flanked by a steep, green mountain. To the viewer's right, a grassy slope ascends, lined with white posts and young leafy trees, leading up to another green mountain, all under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves steadily forward, causing the road markings, the guardrail, the riverbed, and the trees and posts on the right to continuously approach and then recede past the viewer. The winding road and the mountainous landscape further ahead gradually draw closer, revealing more details of the valley as the journey continues.
