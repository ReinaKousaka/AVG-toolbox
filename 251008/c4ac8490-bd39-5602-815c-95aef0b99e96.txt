The first frame presents a dark, wet street scene at night, viewed from a low perspective. A tree trunk occupies the far left foreground, alongside a low, light-colored wall, while a car with intensely bright headlights approaches from the distant center-right, strongly reflecting on the water-covered road and leaf-strewn ground.

The car steadily moves closer and shifts rightward across the frames, its dark form becoming clearer as its headlight reflections stretch further on the wet asphalt. As the vehicle continues past the viewer and exits the frame to the right, a traffic light displaying red and green signals and a street sign are revealed in the middle distance, alongside clearer details of the rain-slicked pavement.

The first frame displays a street scene at night or dusk, with a long, light-colored wall stretching along the left side from foreground to mid-ground, bearing faint reddish marks. A wet sidewalk covered with green leaves runs parallel to the wall, extending towards the background. To the right, a large tree trunk stands beside a dark utility box, beyond which lies a wet street reflecting overhead streetlights. In the distant background, more trees line the street under a dark sky, and faint lights are visible.

The water level on the wet sidewalk and road progressively rises throughout the frames, making puddles more pronounced. Rain streaks become increasingly visible, indicating ongoing rainfall, while reflections of distant streetlights on the road surface grow clearer. A faint red light, likely a traffic signal, appears and intensifies to the far right beyond the utility box. Additionally, dynamic shifts in light and shadow patterns are observed on the wall to the left.

In the first frame, a wet night street scene is observed from a slightly low vantage point. To the immediate left, a light-colored concrete wall extends from the bottom-left corner towards the center. Above this wall, a building featuring a glowing "BABARAT" sign is visible. A wet sidewalk, strewn with light-colored leaves or petals, recedes into the background from the foreground center. Dark utility boxes are partially visible to the viewer's immediate right. Further along the street, trees with green leaves line the path, illuminated by streetlights, while a wet road in the far background reflects traffic lights showing both red and green.
end of description
The camera gradually shifts backward and slightly to the right, expanding the field of view. The dark utility boxes previously on the viewer's immediate right slowly move out of frame. This motion reveals more of the wet street and brings a white pedestrian crossing and a small orange cone into view on the sidewalk further ahead. Reflections of traffic lights on the wet road become more defined, showcasing a prominent red light at the intersection further down the street.
