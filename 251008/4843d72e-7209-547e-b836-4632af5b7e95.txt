In the first frame, a city street scene at twilight shows a person in a dark hoodie partially visible on the immediate right, positioned beside a brightly lit fountain within a reflective pool. A concrete barrier separates this area from a wide sidewalk on the left, where pedestrians walk away from the viewer, with a bicycle parked further left. Across a central plaza, another person walks from left to right, all set against a backdrop of towering illuminated buildings and distant city traffic.
end of description
As frames progress, a woman in a black jacket and white pants, initially among the midground pedestrians on the left sidewalk, walks towards the viewer, becoming the closest pedestrian. Simultaneously, the person crossing the plaza continues moving further right relative to the initial viewpoint, and background vehicles along with other pedestrians gradually recede into the distance.
