The first frame displays a city street with a marked crosswalk in the foreground. A person walks across the crosswalk from left to right, moving away from the viewer, while a utility pole stands centrally with a red traffic light and green pedestrian signal positioned above and to the far left. To the right, a white building with a red and black ground-floor storefront and a blue sign above it is visible, flanked by a darker building further right and a light yellow building to the left in the background.

The pedestrian continues walking further away from the viewer towards the left background. Subsequently, a cyclist enters from the far right of the scene, moving leftwards across the foreground, passing in front of the red-and-black storefront located to the right of the initial viewpoint.
