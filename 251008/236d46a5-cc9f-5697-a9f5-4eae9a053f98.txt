The first frame captures a large, open-air buffet area featuring a central dark wooden table laden with fresh vegetables and fruits in woven baskets, including tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, limes, and avocados, positioned directly in front of the viewer. Behind this, a chef in a white uniform and hat stands with his back to the viewer, attending to a cooking station; to his left are bottles of oil and dressings, and to his right, stacks of plates are held in wooden racks. In the mid-ground and background, other diners are visible at tables to the far left and right, within a rustic setting of wooden pillars and a dark canopy, with lush outdoor greenery visible beyond.
end of description
A person in a white top enters the frame from the far left, moving across the buffet area. This individual then passes the bottles of oil and dressings positioned to the left of the central chef. They continue moving right, becoming partially obscured behind the chef's left side and the adjacent buffet section. The person then almost fully exits the frame, while the chef makes minor, subtle adjustments to his stance.
