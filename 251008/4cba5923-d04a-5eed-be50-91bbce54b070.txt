The first frame depicts a city street at twilight, looking forward down the road. On the immediate left, a concrete sidewalk features a person in a red coat walking away from the viewer, past illuminated shrubs, and a building displaying Japanese text for "整形外科". The center and right are occupied by an asphalt road where two white cars are driving away from the viewer. To the right, commercial buildings line the street, including one with a dark wooden facade and another with a red awning marked "Du Reine." Utility poles and numerous wires crisscross the sky above the buildings on both sides, with more structures receding into the distance under a dusky sky.

From the initial viewpoint, the person on the left sidewalk continues to walk further away down the street. Simultaneously, the two white cars on the road also proceed into the distance away from the viewer. A dark-colored car then emerges from behind the second white car, joining the flow of traffic and likewise moving further away from the viewer. No other new objects or significant changes occur within the visible scene's periphery or foreground.

The first frame presents a city street at dusk, flanked by multi-story buildings. On the left, a light-colored building with Japanese text and illuminated shrubs near the bottom stands alongside a sidewalk where a white car is visible further down. To the right, a white building features a red "Du Reine" awning, while the street recedes into the distance under a cloudy sky crisscrossed by utility wires, with faint vehicle headlights visible in the mid-ground.

Over the subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly advances along the left sidewalk. An approaching car with bright headlights becomes progressively closer and clearer, moving towards the viewer from the distance, and the white car previously further down on the left also appears to move forward relative to the viewer.

In the first frame, a city street is visible, stretching into the distance towards the center. To the viewer's immediate left, a sidewalk runs parallel to the street, bordered by a building with a closed beige shutter, followed by a white parked car and an illuminated yellow sign on a pole. On the right side of the street, a dark grey multi-story building dominates the midground, featuring large windows and an illuminated entrance, while a building with a red awning ('Du Re') is partially seen on the far right foreground with steps leading up. Several cars with bright headlights are clustered in the distant center of the road, and utility poles and overhead wires crisscross against a cloudy, twilight sky.
end of description
A silver car, initially visible in the mid-distance on the right side of the road with its headlights on, begins to move towards the viewer. It steadily approaches, passing the midground buildings on the right. The car continues its trajectory, becoming larger in the frame as it gets closer to the viewer. Finally, the silver car exits the scene to the viewer's right foreground.
