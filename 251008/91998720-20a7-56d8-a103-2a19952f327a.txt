A white Kia SUV is parked in the immediate foreground to the left, with two red stools on the sidewalk next to it. To the left, a row of brightly lit restaurant storefronts with numerous Korean signs lines the street, where people are dining both outside on the sidewalk and inside. The street, extending into the midground, has a black car partially on the left sidewalk and other vehicles further down. On the right sidewalk, people are walking, with tall glass buildings and a construction site visible in the background.
