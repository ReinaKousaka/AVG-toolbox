In the first frame, a bright, sunny street scene is depicted, with a clear blue sky overhead. To the immediate right, a dark pole is partially visible, casting a shadow of the viewer on the concrete sidewalk. A two-story building occupies the mid-right, featuring a cream-colored lower facade with a "ENGEL & VOLKERS" storefront, large display windows showing an office interior, and a dark entrance door to its right; the upper floor is red brick. Along the mid-left, a dark SUV is parked nearest to the viewer, followed by a silver SUV, lining the street next to the sidewalk, which extends into the background past more buildings and a lamppost.

The camera smoothly pans to the left, gradually revealing more of the red brick building to the immediate left of the "ENGEL & VOLKERS" storefront. The dark pole on the far right recedes, and the "ENGEL & VOLKERS" sign, initially mid-right, shifts towards the center-right of the frame. As the pan progresses, more of the street and the distant buildings on the left become prominent, revealing additional parked cars further down the block. The viewer's shadow on the sidewalk also moves, shifting left and eventually off the bottom-right edge of the frame.

The first frame depicts a street scene with a white building on the immediate right foreground, partially showing an "ENGEL" sign, next to a three-story red brick building featuring multiple dark windows and a dark doorway. To the left, a white SUV is parked on the side of a road that extends into the distance with trees and further buildings under a clear blue sky.

As the scene progresses, the viewpoint shifts slightly forward and right relative to the first frame, fully revealing the "ENGEL & VÃ–LKERS" sign on the white building and an additional doorway on the brick structure. Concurrently, a silver pickup truck appears from the background on the road to the left of the stationary white SUV and drives past it, moving closer to the viewer's original position.
