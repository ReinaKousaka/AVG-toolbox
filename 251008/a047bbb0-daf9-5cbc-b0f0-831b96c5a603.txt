The first frame displays a two-lane road curving slightly left into the distance, bordered by towering reddish-orange rocky cliffs with sparse vegetation on both sides under a blue sky with contrails, revealing distant reddish hills ahead.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the road, the foreground shifts and the previously distant landscape ahead appears closer; a dark tunnel entrance is gradually revealed on the left cliff face, emerging from what was initially beyond the curve of the road in the first frame.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a reddish-brown asphalt road with double yellow lines on the left and a single white line on the right, curving gently to the left and receding into the distance from the viewer. Steep, reddish-brown rock formations, partially covered with green shrubs and small trees, rise on both the left and right sides, flanking the road. A prominent green pine tree stands to the mid-right, situated between the road and the right rock face, while a small, dark tunnel entrance is visible further down the road on the left side. Beyond the immediate rock formations, more distant red mesas are visible, all beneath a bright blue sky streaked with white contrails.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the prominent pine tree on the mid-right to shift further right and eventually move out of the frame. The tunnel entrance on the road's left side steadily grows closer from its initial distant position. Simultaneously, the rock formations on both sides move past the viewer, revealing a distinctive pointed rock formation on the far left, initially hidden behind the left cliff, as the perspective shifts forward.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a reddish-brown road curving ahead, flanked by green and brown vegetation, with a dark vehicle shadow at the bottom center. Straight ahead, a dark tunnel entrance is visible within a massive red rock formation, while a distinct light-colored peak rises on the far left beneath a blue sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the viewpoint advances along the road, causing the tunnel entrance directly ahead to grow larger and closer. Objects to the left and right, like vegetation and rock faces, shift further behind the viewer, while the distant pointed peak on the far left remains visible, also appearing slightly closer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the foreground, a red-orange road curves left with double yellow and white lines, leading towards red-orange rocky hills in the midground. A dark tunnel entrance with a yellow interior is visible slightly right of center, nested within the hills and flanked by green trees and shrubs. Above, a bright blue sky displays white clouds and two distinct 'X'-shaped contrails.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the road, the tunnel ahead appears closer and larger. Simultaneously, a distinctive light-colored, pointed rock formation emerges into view on the left side of the frame, becoming prominent beyond the receding trees, while the surrounding red-orange hills and sky remain ahead.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a reddish-brown road with double yellow lines extending directly ahead into a vast landscape of reddish-orange rock formations and sparse green vegetation under a blue sky marked by an 'X' shaped contrail. In the far left background, a distinct light-colored peaked mountain stands, while a dark tunnel entrance is visible straight ahead, slightly to the right, embedded within the main rock wall.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the road recedes, and the tunnel entrance steadily grows larger and closer. A new yellow warning sign, positioned on a post to the right of the road, gradually emerges into view closer to the tunnel, eventually passing to the right of the first-frame's initial visible area as the scene advances.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a reddish-brown road extending from the foreground and curving slightly right towards a dark tunnel entrance visible within a large reddish-brown rock face in the midground-right. To the left, a light-colored, pyramidal rock formation stands tall against the sky, flanked by sparse green trees and bushes along the road's edge, mirroring similar vegetation on the right where a small blue sign is also present. The top portion of the frame features a bright blue sky with white clouds and two intersecting contrails.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the road, the tunnel entrance in the reddish-brown rock face steadily approaches and enlarges. Simultaneously, the prominent pyramidal rock formation on the left slowly recedes towards the left and slightly behind the viewer. A brown diamond-shaped sign, initially hidden, emerges on the left side of the road and moves progressively closer to the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A reddish-brown road, featuring a double yellow center line and a white right shoulder line, curves gently to the right in the foreground, leading towards a dark tunnel entrance carved into a large, horizontally striated reddish-orange rock formation in the midground on the right. To the left of the road, more brush and smaller rock formations ascend, with a prominent light-colored, pointed mountain peaking in the far left background. The sky above is bright blue, marked by two intersecting white contrails forming an 'X' in the upper center.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the road, causing the tunnel entrance and the surrounding reddish-orange rock formation on the right to grow larger and closer. Concurrently, the brush and trees lining both sides of the road appear to approach and pass the viewer. A pine tree on the left foreground becomes significantly more prominent as the scene progresses.
