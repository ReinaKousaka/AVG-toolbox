In the first frame, a dark, classical female bust adorned with beaded necklaces is prominent in the foreground to the right, facing left. Behind it, a tall, ornate light-colored wooden lamp with a dark, textured cylindrical shade stands centrally, partially reflected in a golden-framed mirror to its right. To the left, a light-colored statue of an angelic figure holds a dark hat above its head, against a dark green wall with a framed picture.
end of description
The camera slowly pans to the right. The dark hat and the angelic statue on the far left of the initial frame gradually move out of view to the left. Simultaneously, a second, identical ornate lamp with an illuminated shade emerges from the right side of the frame, positioned to the right of the first lamp and closer to the viewer than the mirror. The dark bust in the foreground remains visible, shifting its position slightly towards the left relative to the frame's center.
