The first frame shows a night street scene dominated by a zebra crossing in the foreground, stretching from the lower-left towards the mid-right. Several pedestrians are mid-crossing, moving from left to right, with one individual in a teal shirt partially visible at the far-left edge. To the right of the crossing, a white and orange bus is stopped at an intersection. Behind the bus, a large, multi-story building with numerous illuminated windows occupies the right side of the frame, while more distant, taller buildings with lights pierce the dark sky in the background to the left. Streetlights and traffic lights (some green on the left, red on the right) illuminate the intersection. A construction barrier with partial text "Welcome to" is visible on the left, behind the crossing pedestrians.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the group of pedestrians continues to move across the zebra crossing from the viewer's left to right, eventually exiting the frame. The person in the teal shirt, initially at the far left, moves further into view and then proceeds across the crossing. Concurrently, the traffic light on the far left side of the intersection transitions from green to red. The bus at the intersection remains stationary to the right of the pedestrians.

The first frame depicts a nighttime city street with multiple pedestrians on a zebra crosswalk and an adjacent sidewalk. To the immediate left, a person in a light blue dress with a white bag and another person on rollerblades are crossing from left to right, while further left on the sidewalk, three more individuals walk away from the viewer past a prominent white construction wall displaying partial text and a QR code. In the mid-ground and right, a wide street intersection is visible, flanked by tall, illuminated buildings and traffic lights showing red and green signals.
end of description
Subsequently, all pedestrians continue moving forward and away from the viewer across the crosswalk and along the sidewalk. As they progress, the white construction wall to the left is further revealed, displaying "Welcome to Chuo City," and more of the street beyond the initial intersection becomes visible.
