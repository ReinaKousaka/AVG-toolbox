The first frame depicts a street scene from a forward-moving perspective. A silver car is centrally positioned ahead on the road, with a red car parked on the left sidewalk further back and a black car on the right nearer to the viewer. Buildings with visible shops at ground level and residential floors above line both sides of the street, extending into the distance, and are partially covered by green trees overhanging the road. A motor scooter is parked on the left sidewalk, and a navigation overlay is in the top-left corner.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The silver car ahead remains in front, while the red car on the left and the black car on the right move towards the respective frame edges as the viewer passes their original positions. A motorcycle with a rider, initially further down the street to the right of the black car, approaches and then moves past the viewer on the right side of the road. The buildings and trees, initially in the midground, shift closer and then recede towards the frame edges, revealing more of the road and distant structures ahead of the initial viewpoint.

The first frame displays a street scene from a moving vehicle's perspective, looking directly forward down a multi-lane road. The road surface is visible in the foreground. To the viewer's immediate left, a red car is parked, followed by a white truck, with storefronts and multi-story buildings beyond, all partially obscured by numerous green trees. Directly ahead, a silver car is driving in the same lane, with other vehicles receding into the distance. To the right, a dark sedan is in a parallel lane, with more parked cars, storefronts, and multi-story buildings also lined by trees. The sky, mostly clear, is visible above the buildings and tree canopies.

As the viewpoint progresses forward from its initial position, objects on the sides like the parked red car and white truck on the left appear to move backward and further left relative to the first-frame viewpoint, eventually moving behind it and exiting the frame. Concurrently, the silver car directly ahead and the dark car on the right move further away from the first-frame viewpoint as the camera follows the flow of traffic. The buildings and trees lining the street also shift backward and outward relative to the fixed initial viewpoint as the camera passes them. New segments of the road, additional parked vehicles, and more distant parts of the buildings and trees are continuously revealed directly ahead, appearing to approach the first-frame viewpoint.
