In the first frame, a street scene is visible under a clear blue sky. A prominent bare-branched tree stands on the tiled sidewalk in the foreground, positioned to the right of a paved road with a yellow centerline. To the left, a white SUV is parked, partially obscuring a yellow cylindrical object, while grey multi-story buildings line the road's left side, extending into the background. On the right, a building partially covered in black tarp is visible, with a lighter building just beyond it, and the sidewalk continues into the distance. Distant mountains are faintly visible in the far background.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward, progressively revealing more of the street ahead. The parked white SUV on the left gradually shifts further behind the initial viewpoint's lateral position. Meanwhile, the sidewalk and the building on the right, covered in black tarp, progressively extend into view further ahead of the initial viewpoint. A small figure, identified as a person, appears on the distant sidewalk ahead of the initial viewpoint around the middle frames, walking towards the viewer.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame captures a street with a prominent, leafless tree positioned centrally on the left sidewalk, casting a shadow rightward. To the left, a paved road features two cars and is flanked by multi-story gray buildings, while to the right, a wider sidewalk leads to a building largely obscured by a black tarp, presenting a small structure and an overhead light fixture.
end of description
In the following frames, a person in a light jacket emerges on the right sidewalk, walking away from the viewer and progressing further into the background past the tree. Concurrently, the dark car on the left road slightly shifts forward, and by the later frames, a second, more distant figure becomes faintly visible even further down the right sidewalk.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a street scene under a clear blue sky. On the right, a building partially draped in dark tarpaulin features reflective storefront windows and a security camera positioned on its upper right. A large, bare tree trunk stands prominently in the left foreground, partially obscuring a grey sedan parked on the adjacent road. A paved sidewalk with tactile paving extends centrally towards the background, flanked by other bare trees. Multi-story buildings line the left side of the street, where distant pedestrians are visible, while a white building appears further down on the right.
end of description
The viewer continuously moves forward along the sidewalk. The large bare tree trunk in the left foreground moves out of frame to the left, revealing more of the street and buildings on that side. The grey sedan on the left road progresses further away, while the security camera on the upper right of the initial building disappears from view to the right. A red mailbox-like object attached to the white building on the right becomes more distinctly visible as the viewpoint advances, with pedestrians continuing into the distance on the left.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a large tree trunk occupies the far left foreground. A gray sedan is parked on the street in the mid-ground to the left, with a street lamp post just beyond it, and gray buildings line the street further back. On the right, a paved sidewalk displays tree shadows, leading to a white building with a dark facade on its right, near which a small red object is attached to a pole.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the gray sedan on the left drives away, while two people appear further down the street on the left sidewalk, walking towards the viewer's initial position. The street lamp post, previously on the left mid-ground, and the red object, on the right mid-ground, eventually move off-screen to the left and right respectively as the white building on the right moves closer, revealing more of its facade.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a street scene with a bare tree in the center-left on a paved sidewalk, running parallel to a road featuring a parked grey car and buildings further left. A white brick building with a railing and dry bushes occupies the mid-right, while a grey pole stands in the foreground left; distant mountains are visible under a blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the pole, tree, and parked car shift left and recede relative to the initial frame. The white building on the right also moves right and backward from its original position, while a blue figure and an orange cone further down the sidewalk become progressively closer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a street scene is viewed from ground level, looking forward. A bare-branched tree stands prominently in the left foreground, casting a shadow on the sidewalk. To the left of the tree, a dark grey building lines the street, with several parked cars visible. On the right, a two-story building with white brick on the lower level and grey siding above features a white railing along a short set of stairs leading to an entrance, with dry brown foliage in the bottom right corner. The paved sidewalk extends into the distance, bordered by buildings and trees, with mountains visible under a clear blue sky in the far background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk. The tree in the foreground gradually shifts further to the left, partially exiting the frame, while its shadow on the sidewalk also changes shape and position relative to the camera's new perspective. The white railing on the right appears to shorten as the camera moves past it, revealing more of the building's facade, including two mailboxes near the entrance. Objects in the distance, like the person in blue on the sidewalk and the buildings, appear closer as the viewer advances.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A paved street stretches forward from the viewer, bordered on the right by a sidewalk and a light gray brick building with a white railing in front of it. On the far left, a bare-branched tree trunk and its shadows frame the scene, with a dark gray multi-story building and parked cars visible along the street's left side. In the mid-right, a person in blue is walking away on the sidewalk, while distant mountains and a clear blue sky complete the background.
end of description
The person in blue, initially on the mid-right sidewalk, continuously walks further away from the first-frame viewpoint, eventually exiting the frame towards the right. Simultaneously, sunlight shifts subtly across the right-side building, creating slightly elongated shadows. The "SEOUL WALKER" watermark progressively becomes more visible in the bottom-left corner throughout the sequence.
