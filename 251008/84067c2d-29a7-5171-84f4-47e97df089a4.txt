The first frame captures a bustling night-time city street. To the viewer's immediate left, a sidewalk runs alongside a building featuring a purple circular sign and an orange traffic cone. This sidewalk leads into a covered walkway with recessed lighting, where several pedestrians are visible further down. The street in the mid-ground, marked with yellow crosshatchings, has a black van on its right side, with other vehicles and their headlights visible in the distance, moving away from the viewer. On the right side of the street, brightly lit storefronts with various neon signs, including "2nd STREET," illuminate a sidewalk where more pedestrians are present, along with a silver car and a parking sign.
end of description
The black van on the street's right side begins to move forward and gradually exits the frame to the right. Concurrently, a scooter with a rider, initially on the far right, proceeds forward and disappears from the frame to the viewer's right. Subsequently, a white SUV enters the frame from the right, moving towards the viewer. A second white car then appears behind the white SUV, also progressing towards the viewer on the right side of the street.
