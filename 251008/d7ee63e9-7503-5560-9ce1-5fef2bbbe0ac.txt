end of description
As frames progress, pedestrians move from right to left along the sidewalk, passing the first-frame viewpoint. The initial group, including the blue umbrella, exits to the left, while new individuals, like a woman with a black umbrella and a beige bag, enter from the right and proceed left. Traffic also moves in the background to the left.
