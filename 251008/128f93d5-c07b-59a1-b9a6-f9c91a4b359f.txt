The first frame depicts a bustling pedestrian street flanked by multi-story buildings under an overcast sky. To the viewer's left, a "SUSHI" shop with a large window and dark awning is followed by another store with a dark wooden facade and an A-frame sign on the sidewalk. To the right, a half-timbered building with brown and yellow accents and blue shutters features a green sign above a shop window, with a red merchandise display rack extending onto the pavement. Numerous pedestrians occupy the middle ground, walking in various directions, while the street recedes into the background, revealing more buildings and distant greenery.

The viewer's perspective steadily advances forward along the street. Pedestrians throughout the scene continuously move and change their relative positions. As the camera progresses, initial foreground objects like the "SUSHI" shop and the merchandise rack recede or pass out of view to the left and right. Concurrently, buildings and details initially in the mid-ground and background move closer, revealing more architectural detail as new sections of the street become visible.
