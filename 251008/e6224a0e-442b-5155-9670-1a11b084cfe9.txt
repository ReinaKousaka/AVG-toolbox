As the camera moves forward and slightly right, the dark red car exits the frame to the left, revealing more of the blue truck. The two women continue walking away, now accompanied by a man in a yellow shirt and later a small brown dog, all moving further to the right relative to the initial viewpoint. More of a green vintage car parked behind the red one, and additional people and background details, become visible as the viewpoint shifts.

To its right, in the mid-ground, are a stationary red vintage convertible, followed by a green vintage car, and then a black vintage car, all parked in a row on a wooden pier surface marked with white lines. In the background, white buildings with blue awnings, including one labeled "PIER SEAFOOD," line the left, while further right, more buildings with distinctive blue roofs and palm trees are visible under a clear blue sky. Numerous people are scattered throughout the scene, with a woman in a purple floral top and dark pants prominent in the mid-right.

Over the subsequent frames, the woman in the purple floral top and dark pants slowly walks towards the right side of the frame, moving slightly further away from the viewer's initial position. A man in a blue shirt, initially partially obscured behind her, becomes more visible as he walks alongside and slightly behind her, also moving towards the right and further into the mid-ground. Other people in the background and mid-ground also exhibit minor movements, maintaining the bustling atmosphere of the pier, while the parked vintage cars remain stationary.
