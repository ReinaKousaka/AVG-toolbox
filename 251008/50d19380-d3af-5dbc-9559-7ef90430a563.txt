In the first frame, the viewer faces down a brightly lit mall corridor. The tiled floor extends into the distance, with a group of approximately seven people walking away from the viewer in the midground on the left. To the left, a "STEVE MADDEN" store entrance and other storefronts are visible, leading to an escalator in the background. On the right, a white metal security gate, composed of vertical bars, partially blocks the entrance to a store, behind which a dark counter and some merchandise are faintly visible. A series of white, open-frame display units stand along the right wall, leading towards the gated entrance. The ceiling is illuminated by rectangular light panels.

The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing more of the interior of the store behind the security gate on the right side. Additional shelves and items, including what appears to be a display of beauty products or small goods, become more clearly visible further to the right of the initial view. The group of people in the midground continues to move away from the viewer, progressing deeper into the mall's left corridor. The overall scene remains consistent, with the primary dynamic change being this subtle shift in perspective on the right.

The first frame shows a brightly lit mall corridor with a tiled floor leading forward. To the left, stores and an escalator are visible with people walking away in the distance, while a masked woman approaches in the left foreground; on the right, a partially open store entrance is gated, revealing interior display shelves and anti-theft pedestals.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the metal security gate on the right continues retracting further right, fully exposing the store's interior shelves and a digital sign displaying "LIMITED OFFERS" and "20% OFF" to the right of the initial gate position. Concurrently, the masked woman passes by the viewer's left side, continuing her path towards the left edge of the frame, as other distant pedestrians move further into the mall.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
A wide, tiled mall corridor stretches into the distance, with a partially visible person on the viewer's far left walking away and an escalator further back. On the right, white security gates open to a retail store revealing wooden shelves stocked with merchandise, while several people walk away in the midground.
end of description
The person on the far left continues moving away and exits the scene leftwards relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The midground group of people recedes further into the distance from the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, a person with a yellow bag, initially less prominent behind the foreground, becomes clearer while moving leftwards in the midground, and more of the retail store's shelves, previously further to the right, become visible.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a well-lit shopping mall corridor with a light-tiled floor extending into the background. On the left, an escalator ascends, accompanied by a large planter, while several people walk away from the viewer along the wide aisle. To the right, multiple white anti-theft gates stand at the entrance of a retail store, which is packed with shelves of merchandise and separated from the main path by a dark wooden wall.
end of description
As the frames progress, people move within the scene; the individual in the light blue top walks left and deeper into the mall, while the pair in dark clothes continues further away from the viewer in the central aisle. A person is seen moving around inside the store on the right, and towards the sequence's end, another individual appears on the far left, walking initially towards and then past the viewer to the left.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The initial frame displays a well-lit mall corridor with a tiled floor, featuring two white security gates on the right foreground leading to a store entrance with wooden and red paneling. Two men walk away from the viewer in the mid-ground, while on the left, a person is visible near a planter and an escalator in the background.

end of description
As frames progress, the two men continue to recede into the background, moving further away from the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the rightmost security gate moves forward into the frame, fully revealing its interactive display panels.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a bright mall corridor with a tiled floor leading into the distance. In the immediate foreground to the right, a white digital display stand is partially visible. Further back on the right is a wooden pillar followed by an open storefront with two security gate pylons. In the mid-ground, two people walk away from the viewer, passing two yellow "STOP" signs; to their left, a large potted plant in a grey vase and a rectangular grey trash receptacle are situated. An ascending escalator with a glass railing is on the far left, while the background reveals a long, brightly lit corridor with various shops.
end of description
The two individuals in the mid-ground continue walking away from the viewer, progressively moving deeper into the mall corridor. Concurrently, a person within the store on the right becomes more clearly visible as they move towards the entrance area. The viewer's perspective slowly tracks forward, causing the digital display on the far right foreground to gradually move out of frame. By the final frames, an additional person becomes visible near the trash receptacle on the left, alongside the figure near the escalator.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a brightly lit indoor mall hallway with a light-tiled floor. To the viewer's left, a large white structure with an escalator leads upwards, and a tall plant in a vase stands in the mid-ground, with two people further left. In the distance, yellow "PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE" barriers block part of the hallway, beyond which two people walk away from the viewer. To the viewer's right, a wooden beam partially obscures a store entrance with two white security gates, inside which a person browses shelves. The hallway recedes into the background, lined with storefronts and overhead lighting.
end of description
The two individuals initially walking away in the center of the frame continue further down the hallway, receding into the distance. The person previously visible inside the store on the right moves deeper within the store. A new person enters the store from the viewer's right side, becoming fully visible as they pass the security gates. Subsequently, another individual, wearing a blue jacket, walks from the far left past the large plant, moving towards the right side of the frame and entering the store.
