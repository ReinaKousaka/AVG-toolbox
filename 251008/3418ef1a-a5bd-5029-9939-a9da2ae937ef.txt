frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame shows a view directly down a set of train tracks that curve gently to the right into the distance. To the immediate left of the tracks, a small building with a brown roof and white facade is partially visible, behind which stands a large, grey corrugated metal industrial building. Further left are sparse trees and a power pole with overhead lines. To the right of the tracks, a narrow concrete platform runs alongside a grassy embankment covered with trees and shrubs. In the far background, the tracks lead towards a bridge-like structure, all under a clear blue sky with faint contrails.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks. The small building on the left recedes, revealing more of its lower facade and immediate surroundings. A concrete retaining wall gradually emerges along the left side of the tracks, replacing the lower vegetation, while a metal railing appears along the concrete platform to the right. The large grey building and the wooded embankment on the right become closer and more prominent as the train approaches the distant bridge structure.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a view looking down a pair of train tracks receding into the distance. To the left, a long, light-gray corrugated metal building runs parallel, separated by a concrete path and grass. To the right, a similar concrete path with a metal railing is flanked by green bushes and trees. Overhead wires are faintly visible against the clear blue sky above, and a bridge-like structure is discernible further down the tracks.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks. Graffiti in blue and red letters gradually appears and grows larger on the left-side corrugated building, which was clean in the first frame, as the viewer approaches it. Further along the left side, a utility pole supporting overhead wires becomes visible and passes by the viewer's field of vision.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a train track extending directly away from the viewer into the distance under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's immediate left, a long, grey corrugated building runs parallel to the tracks, while to the right, a gravel path borders a grassy bank with dense trees, also stretching into the distance. An overhead bridge or structure is visible further down the tracks.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, causing the building and the landscape on both sides to recede past the viewer. A tall utility pole with overhead lines, initially ahead on the left, approaches and then passes the viewer, revealing more of the track and surroundings ahead.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a view looking forward along train tracks. Centered, two train tracks with gravel ballast extend towards the horizon. To the immediate left, a long, white industrial-style building runs parallel to the tracks, separated by a grassy strip and a chain-link fence. Further along the tracks on the left, beyond the initial white building, glimpses of other industrial structures are visible. To the right, a dense, verdant slope covered with trees and foliage runs parallel to the tracks. Overhead, catenary wires are visible against a clear blue sky with faint contrails; a support pole stands on the right side of the tracks in the mid-ground, with another further in the distance.
end of description
As the camera moves forward along the tracks from the first-frame viewpoint, the white building and fence initially on the left move from being beside the viewer to progressively behind the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, an industrial area, previously further along the tracks and partially obscured, becomes fully visible ahead of the initial viewpoint on the left, featuring stacked white materials. The treeline on the right also moves from being beside the viewer to receding behind the initial viewpoint. Overhead catenary poles, initially ahead on the right and further down the tracks, pass by the initial viewpoint, with new poles appearing and then passing by on the left and right sides.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows train tracks extending directly into the distance, flanked by gravel. To the left, a grassy strip and fence precede industrial buildings with stacked white materials and shelving, while to the right, a platform and dense treeline run alongside the tracks, all under a clear blue sky with overhead wires.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the industrial buildings and stacked materials on the left gradually recede and pass out of view. Concurrently, the treeline and platform on the right move past the viewer, with a utility pole displaying "2 4m" becoming prominent and passing to the immediate right of the viewpoint before receding into the background.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A train track stretches centrally into the distance under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's left, an open-sided storage facility filled with stacked materials stands beside the tracks, with a light-colored industrial building visible further behind it. To the right, dense trees and bushes line a hillside, and overhead power lines traverse the sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the storage facility on the left and the initial dense foliage on the right gradually move out of frame. The industrial building to the left becomes more prominent, revealing a blue vehicle or object parked in front of it. A utility pole emerges into view on the right, passing by as the scene progresses.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
Immediately in front of the viewer, railway tracks extend into the distance. To the immediate left, beyond a gravel strip, grass, and a wire fence, a concrete platform supports a large, grey industrial building with visible loading bays and blue industrial containers. A lighter, perhaps temporary, structure is partially visible further to the upper left of this building. To the right, a gravel strip and grass lead to a dense treeline, interspersed with a utility pole carrying overhead wires that traverse the sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the foreground elements, including the industrial building on the left and the treeline and utility pole on the right, appear to recede into the distance. New sections of the industrial building, showing more loading bays and blue objects, continuously become visible on the left side. Similarly, new parts of the treeline and additional utility poles emerge from the distance on the right and pass by. This progression consistently reveals more of the railway environment as the viewer advances.
