The first frame shows the viewer on a multi-lane city road, directly behind a person in a blue shirt on a scooter, moving forward. Ahead, other scooters and a white car are also moving away, while the road is flanked by multi-story residential buildings on the left, and trees with streetlights on the right, all leading towards distant cityscapes under a clear sky. end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward, causing all vehicles—including the blue-shirted scooter, the two scooters ahead (black and pink), and the white car—to advance further along the road away from the original viewpoint. A new scooter with a yellow-clad driver becomes clearly visible behind the pink-shirted scooter in the right lane, also moving forward.

The first frame captures a sunny day on a multi-lane road, seen from the perspective of someone on a scooter, with the back of a person in a blue shirt on another scooter directly ahead. To the right, a white car, two other scooters, a dense line of trees, and a traffic sign with multiple 'no' symbols are visible further ahead, while to the left, a white barrier separates the viewer's path from a lower road with more scooters and distant residential buildings.
end of description
As the scene progresses, all visible vehicles, including the lead scooter and those to the right, move further ahead, receding into the distance relative to the initial viewpoint. Scooters on the lower left road also advance, and a new red circular 10 km/h speed limit sign becomes fully visible further ahead on the left, near the distinctive streetlights.

From a forward-moving perspective on a road, a person on a green e-scooter is directly ahead of the viewer, flanked by a white barrier to the immediate left. Further ahead, the road is divided by a median with distinctive streetlights, with other scooters and a white car visible in the mid-ground, while buildings line the distant left and dense trees the right under a clear sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the '10t' weight limit sign, initially in the mid-left above the median, steadily approaches and then passes to the viewer's left. The immediate white barrier on the left recedes out of view, revealing a wider roadway and more buildings further back on the left. All vehicles ahead, including the person on the blue e-scooter directly in front, maintain their relative positions as the road continues to unfold ahead of the viewer.

In the first frame, the viewer looks down a multi-lane road in an urban environment. Immediately in the foreground, a person in a blue shirt on a scooter is visible, along with two other scooters further to the right. A low median with green foliage separates the viewer's lane from a parallel road on the left, where several other scooters are present. A prominent streetlight with an ornate top stands to the left of the viewer's path, part of a series extending into the distance. A white car is visible further down the road, and on the far left, a large building complex is visible, with dense trees lining the right side of the road.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the streetlights and roadside features on both sides advance towards and past the viewer, while the initial scooters and the white car move further into the distance along the road. Simultaneously, new sections of the road and additional scooters on the left path emerge into view from behind the initial positions.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a multi-lane road from a forward-moving perspective under a clear blue sky. In the immediate foreground is the road surface, with a white car visible further ahead in the main lane. A median strip adorned with low green bushes separates this main lane from a parallel lane on the left, where a person on a scooter is seen. To the far right, another person on a scooter travels in a lane bordered by a dense line of green trees. Tall streetlights with distinctive decorative tops line the median, extending into the distant horizon where buildings and more trees are visible.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the white car and the scooter on the right, initially ahead, continue to advance further ahead from the first-frame viewpoint; the right scooter eventually exits the frame to the right. The scooter on the left progresses further ahead in its lane, while another scooter appears behind it, remaining to the left. The streetlights and median strip gradually pass the first-frame viewpoint, and formerly distant buildings and a large billboard on the left become more clearly visible further ahead.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a straight road extending into the distance, with a white car centrally ahead and a person on a moped to the far right. To the left, a green median with streetlights separates the main road from a parallel path where another moped is seen, with buildings and a billboard visible in the distant background. end of description. As the viewpoint moves forward, the streetlights and trees on the right pass by, while the moped on the left advances and eventually passes the viewer's original position. The white car continues ahead, maintaining its relative distance as the buildings on the left become more defined.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows the viewer on a paved road looking ahead, with a white car in the middle lane and a person on a motorcycle to its right, both driving away. To the left, a flowerbed with red blooms separates the road from a pedestrian walkway where two people on scooters are visible. Along both sides of the road are guardrails and a series of distinct streetlights extending into the distance. In the background, a large blue billboard and multiple buildings are present on the left, partially obscured by trees, while more buildings and trees appear on the right side of the frame.
end of description
As the viewer progresses, the road's features like streetlights, guardrails, and flowerbeds continuously shift from ahead towards the sides and past the initial viewpoint. The white car and motorcycle ahead move further into the distance, while additional scooters and their riders appear on the pedestrian path to the left, also moving ahead relative to the viewer's initial position. The large blue billboard on the left, initially partly obscured, becomes more fully visible, revealing its text and additional background buildings beyond it. New background buildings and trees continuously emerge and expand into view on both the left and right sides of the road as the camera moves forward.
