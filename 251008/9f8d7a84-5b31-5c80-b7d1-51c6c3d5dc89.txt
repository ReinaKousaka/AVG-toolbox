First, a dirt path curves from the bottom left into a dense evergreen forest, where moss-covered trees rise vertically. A large, mossy fallen log lies horizontally across the lower middle to the right, partially obscuring the undergrowth behind it.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly moves forward and slightly to the right through the forest. As it progresses, the fallen log recedes to the viewer's right and slightly downwards, revealing more of the forest floor and additional fallen branches further back to its right, while the path extends deeper into the woodland ahead.
