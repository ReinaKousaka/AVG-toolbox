The first frame presents a city street scene at dusk from a sidewalk perspective. To the left, outdoor cafe seating is visible in front of a building adorned with illuminated signs, notably "Coffee 50 안경" and a bright pink "프리미엄." On the right, a line of parked rental bicycles stretches along the sidewalk, where a person in a dark coat stands facing slightly away. Down the paved sidewalk, a person in a white jacket walks away from the viewer, while further right, a street is congested with vehicles, including a large white truck, leading towards distant tall buildings with lit windows.
end of description
The person in the white jacket steadily walks further into the distance along the sidewalk, moving away from the viewer's initial position. All other visible elements, including the person by the bicycles and the vehicles on the street, remain essentially static relative to the first-frame viewpoint across the subsequent frames.

The initial frame depicts an urban night street scene, with a sidewalk on the left foreground featuring cafe furniture and various Korean-language signs, including a prominent pink banner reading "프리미엄 와," lining a building. On the midground sidewalk, a person in a white jacket walks away from the viewer, while to their right, a street with parked bicycles and several vehicles stretches into the distance, flanked by tall illuminated buildings and bare trees.
end of description
Chronologically, the person continues walking further away from the viewer along the sidewalk. As they move, a small wooden stand or cart, previously partially obscured, becomes fully revealed further down the sidewalk on the right side from the viewer's initial position. Vehicles on the street beyond the person remain largely static, with minimal discernible movement.

The first frame shows a nighttime street scene with a brightly lit building on the left, featuring a large pink and yellow neon sign above and various posters, including a prominent blue vertical sign in the foreground. A paved sidewalk extends centrally away from the viewer, where a person in a white jacket walks into the mid-ground, paralleled on the right by a street with several cars and distant tall buildings.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the person in the white jacket continues walking further away from the viewer along the sidewalk. A new individual emerges inside the building to the left, initially behind the blue sign, then becomes fully visible and moves around within the interior. Vehicles on the street to the right show subtle movements, indicating ongoing traffic.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a vibrant street scene at dusk features a building on the left with a neon pink sign and a glass-front shop where a masked person is visible inside. On the central sidewalk, two pedestrians walk away from the viewer past a wooden A-frame sign, while on the right, traffic moves along a street bordered by trees and illuminated high-rise buildings in the distance.
end of description
Subsequently, the masked person inside the shop on the left recedes further within and eventually exits the frame. The two pedestrians on the central sidewalk continue walking away, progressing further into the distance relative to the viewer. Concurrently, the dark SUV on the right moves forward past the viewer, with other vehicles also advancing, as the overall viewpoint subtly shifts forward.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a nighttime city street scene, with brightly lit commercial buildings on the left, featuring a large real estate advertisement and restaurant fronts with orange awnings and brown sandwich board signs. In the mid-ground, two pedestrians walk away from the viewer on the sidewalk. To the right, a tree and a street lamp stand before a line of parked cars and moving traffic, with distant tall buildings illuminating the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the two pedestrians continue walking further away from the viewer. Simultaneously, a large red vehicle gradually emerges from the distant background, moving forward on the street and becoming more prominent as it approaches the mid-ground.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a twilight city street, with a building on the immediate left featuring a large window displaying Korean text and a person's image, in front of which two brown A-frame signs stand with Korean script. Further down the sidewalk to the left, another storefront with an awning is visible, and in the midground, a pedestrian in a dark coat and mask walks towards the viewer, while another person walks away in the distance. To the right, a street with moving and parked cars runs parallel to the sidewalk, adorned with a tall advertising sign for food.

end of description

The pedestrian in the dark coat and mask continues walking towards the viewer, then moves past the food sign and exits the frame to the right, revealing a red fire hydrant behind where they stood. Concurrently, the other pedestrian in the light top proceeds further down the sidewalk into the distance. Vehicles on the street also exhibit subtle movements, with a white van on the far right beginning to move forward out of view.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a city street at dusk, with a woman in a dark winter coat, mask, and hat walking towards the viewer on the right, holding bags, with a red fire hydrant behind her. To the left, a brick building has a bright storefront displaying goods under an orange awning, a wooden door with an "OPEN" sign, and a lantern. In the midground, a pedestrian walks away on the sidewalk, and a white car is stopped at an intersection amidst other vehicles. Tall city buildings, streetlights, and a yellow illuminated sign mark the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the woman on the right moves forward, passing the viewer and eventually exiting the frame to the left. The viewpoint subtly advances, revealing more of the storefront's length on the left and making a red street bollard near the curb more prominent. Consequently, the 'OPEN' sign on the far left door recedes out of view relative to the initial frame's position. The pedestrian in the midground continues walking further away from the first-frame viewpoint, while the traffic in the distance remains largely static.
