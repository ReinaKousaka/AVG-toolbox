In the first frame, a modern building with numerous illuminated windows occupies the central and upper-left background, featuring a dark sign with Japanese text and the Mitsubishi logo visible below its main entrance. To the left of the sign is a white metal fence, while a low green hedge runs along the base of a concrete wall to its right. Two men walk across the wet asphalt road in the foreground: one in a light shirt with a backpack is moving right across the center-right, and another, mostly obscured, is on the far right, both ahead of the viewer.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward and slightly to the right, the man initially in the center-right foreground exits the frame to the right. The camera continues to track the second man, revealing more of the building's facade and a long, well-maintained hedge along a paved pathway that extends to the right of the initial sign. A new, taller building and a third person walking further ahead on the path emerge into view on the far right, previously behind the first-frame's right edge. The Mitsubishi sign recedes towards the left side of the frame as the path opens up.

A paved path extends forward with a yellow tactile strip underfoot, leading away from the viewer. A person with a backpack is centered in the path, walking away. To the viewer's immediate right are green foliage and an orange traffic cone. To the left, a modern building with illuminated windows rises, behind a low green hedge that runs along the path. Further ahead and to the right, a multi-story building with illuminated windows is partially obscured by trees, while a small house and a streetlight are visible in the distance behind the hedge.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the paved path from the first-frame viewpoint, the person ahead continues walking away and recedes further into the distance. The orange traffic cone on the immediate right in the first frame moves out of view, and a wider street with a taller building is revealed further to the right. Another individual emerges from behind the central green hedge, moving from the left-mid-distance towards the first-frame viewpoint, eventually passing the initial foreground person. The urban scene ahead and to the right expands as the viewer progresses.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a dark paved pathway with a yellow tactile strip, bordered by a green hedge on the left and lush foliage on the right, leading towards a large illuminated building in the midground. A woman walks towards the viewer on the left side of the pathway, while a man with a backpack walks away from the viewer slightly right of center, with a street visible further right.
end of description
The woman walking towards the viewer continues to advance, passing to the viewer's left. The man walking away from the viewer proceeds further down the pathway, and additional pedestrians are revealed walking ahead of him, further away from the viewer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures a nighttime street scene from a ground-level perspective. In the immediate foreground, a woman with dark hair is partially visible on the far left, walking towards the viewer. Slightly to her right and further into the frame, a man with a dark backpack walks away from the viewer along a paved sidewalk that features yellow tactile paving. To the left of the sidewalk is a dense green hedge, behind which stands a large, multi-story building with illuminated windows, extending into the midground. On the right side of the sidewalk, lush green trees and bushes line the path, with streetlights and other buildings visible in the midground and background, and a man walking towards the viewer further down the path on the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the woman on the far left quickly walks out of view to the left of the frame. The man with the backpack continues walking away from the viewer, moving deeper into the scene along the sidewalk. Simultaneously, the man initially in the midground-right approaches closer to the viewer, while another individual emerges from the distant midground-right, following him, both walking towards the viewer on the same sidewalk. The entire urban streetscape, including the buildings and foliage on both sides, slowly shifts, creating the impression of the viewer moving forward along the path.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays three individuals walking away from the viewer on a lit sidewalk at night, bordered by a dense green hedge on the left and foreground foliage on the right, with urban buildings and streetlights visible in the background. The closest person on the right is partially obscured by the foliage, while two others are further ahead on the sidewalk, one with a backpack and the other slightly further back.
end of description
Over subsequent frames, the person initially closest to the viewer on the right moves leftward, eventually exiting the frame completely, to the left of their initial first-frame position. Simultaneously, the two individuals on the sidewalk continue walking forward, further away from the viewer, with the person closer to the viewer pulling out and looking at a phone.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a dense green hedge runs along the left side, paralleling a sidewalk with yellow tactile paving on the right. Two individuals walk away from the viewer on this sidewalk; the person on the left wears a backpack, while the one on the right, closer to the viewer, wears a face mask and holds a phone. In the background, a multi-story building with illuminated windows stands on the left, with streetlights and other urban buildings visible further along the path on the right under a dark night sky.
end of description
The two individuals continue walking forward along the sidewalk, progressively moving further away from the viewer. The person initially on the right, closer to the viewer, gradually recedes and moves out of the frame to the right. The person on the left also moves further into the distance. As they proceed, more of the urban street scene, including additional distant buildings and streetlights, becomes increasingly visible further ahead along the path.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a person wearing a dark jacket and light pants, carrying a backpack, walks away from the viewer on a sidewalk with yellow tactile paving. To the viewer's immediate left, a tall, dense green hedge runs parallel, extending forward. To the right of the sidewalk, a street with white markings and orange traffic cones is visible, bordered by several small trees and bushes. In the midground, a multi-story building with large windows and a lamppost stands to the left, while another multi-story building with lit windows is further to the right. The background shows a dark night sky with distant city lights and more buildings.
end of description
The person continues walking forward and further away from the viewer along the sidewalk. As they proceed, the scene subtly widens, revealing more of the street and buildings ahead to the right, though no entirely new objects are introduced into the frame's scope that were not already implicitly present in the forward direction of the initial viewpoint.
