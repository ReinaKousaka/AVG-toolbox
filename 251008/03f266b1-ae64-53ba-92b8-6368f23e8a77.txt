The viewer is positioned on a wet sidewalk at night, looking down a rainy city street. To the immediate right, a sidewalk with a curb and a large light-colored banner are visible, while a wide, wet asphalt road, reflecting streetlights and distant car headlights, stretches centrally into the distance, marked with white and yellow lines. Along the left, a row of trees, streetlights, and a bus stop shelter are present, mirroring more distant trees and lights on the right side of the road, with faint city buildings and an overhead blue sign in the background.

The scene largely remains static, depicting a continuous rainy night. A light-colored car, initially a distant form with bright headlights in the center-right lane of the main road, begins to move towards the viewer. The car progressively advances, its headlights and reflections on the wet road becoming clearer and more defined as it approaches the viewer's viewpoint from the mid-distance.

The first frame depicts a wet, dark city street at night during rainfall. A wide asphalt road, marked with a broken white lane line, stretches from the foreground center into the distance, reflecting streetlights and vehicle headlights. On the right, a sidewalk with a yellow curb features dark trees and a partially visible white and pink banner in the near foreground. A light-colored car, with its headlights on, is in the midground on the left lane, driving towards the viewer and reflecting on the wet pavement. Further along the left side of the road, a bus stop with a blue illuminated sign is visible, nestled among trees with distant buildings and city lights glowing in the background.

The light-colored car on the mid-left moves closer to the viewer before passing towards the bus stop on the far left. As it proceeds, a substantial splash of water erupts from the road in the center-left where the car just was, rising and then dissipating. Subsequently, two individuals at the bus stop become more distinctly visible on the far left. The white and pink banner on the immediate right also subtly billows.

The viewer observes a wet, dark city street at night, looking down a road reflecting numerous streetlights and distant building lights. A bus stop shelter with a blue roof is visible on the far left, while a line of trees and utility poles runs along the right sidewalk. A median with more trees and streetlights separates the road from buildings further left, all beneath a sky partially obscured by rain streaks on a surface close to the viewer.

A light-colored traffic cone appears on the wet road slightly right of center in the mid-distance. Concurrently, a distant traffic light on the right side of the road changes to red. Subsequently, the traffic cone disappears from its position on the road. Throughout, light reflections on the wet asphalt continuously ripple and shift, indicating persistent rain.
