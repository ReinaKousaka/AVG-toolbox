The first frame depicts two cyclists riding away from the viewer on a paved road, which stretches into the distance under a blue sky with scattered clouds. To the viewer's left, a rocky hill covered with evergreen and deciduous trees rises, while to the right, a forested valley with distant snowy peaks extends.

As the scene progresses, the cyclists continue forward, and the road ahead gradually becomes more visible, revealing its gentle curve to the left. The cyclist on the left briefly raises their left arm, pointing towards the hillside to their left, in frames 3 and 8, before lowering it.
