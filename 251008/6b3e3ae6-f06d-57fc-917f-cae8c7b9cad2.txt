The first frame displays a bright blue sky above a clear blue ocean on the left, meeting a rugged coastline. In the midground, a tall, narrow rock formation stands in the sea near the coast, while a steep, shadowed cliff face dominates the right side. Below the cliff, dense green vegetation covers the land, with a faint dirt path visible through sparser vegetation in the left midground and foreground.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily advances forward and slightly upwards along the coastline, causing the winding dirt path in the midground to become increasingly defined and closer to the viewer. The steep, rocky cliff on the right progressively rises higher in the frame, revealing more of its rugged surface as the camera glides past. Meanwhile, the dense green vegetation below shifts, showing more texture and detail, and the distant ocean and rock formation subtly shift further to the left in the frame due to the forward movement.

The first frame presents a coastal scene under a bright blue sky with the sun high on the right. To the left, a vibrant turquoise ocean stretches horizontally, meeting a rocky shoreline. In the foreground, a dirt path is flanked by lush green and yellow-green vegetation, while a steep, rugged cliff face rises vertically to the right. A prominent, tall rock formation stands in the distance along the coast, slightly left of center.
end of description
The viewpoint glides forward along the path, causing the immediate foreground vegetation to blur and revealing more of the rocky coastline and the vibrant turquoise water to the left. As the camera progresses, additional sections of the shore and the base of the towering cliff on the right become visible, while the distant rock formation slowly shifts further left in the frame.

The first frame displays a vibrant coastal landscape under a bright blue sky, with a sun flare emanating from the top right. A vast turquoise ocean occupies the left side, meeting a rugged coastline that curves from the foreground right towards the distant center-left. Along this coast, green scrub and rocky terrain are prominent, leading to a tall, slender sea stack in the mid-distance, while a large, dark mountain rises sharply on the right.
end of description
The viewpoint continuously moves forward along the coastline, parallel to the water. New sections of the rocky shore, verdant scrub, and a dirt path, initially behind the first-frame viewpoint, are progressively revealed in the foreground and move past the viewer towards the background. The distant sea stack and the sprawling mountain on the right maintain their relative positions in the evolving landscape.
