The first frame displays a vast mountain landscape under a clear blue sky, with a prominent, rugged peak covered in vibrant green grass in the mid-ground, slightly right of center. Distant hazy blue-green mountains extend to the left horizon, and another rocky formation is partially visible to the far right. The text "Pointe de Chavassse 2021m Alt." is overlaid centrally in the upper sky.

Subsequently, the viewpoint subtly glides forward and slightly closer to the central mountain peak. The descriptive text gradually fades out from the upper sky, revealing an unobstructed view of the increasingly detailed green slopes and rocky features as the camera continues its smooth, unaltering trajectory.

The first frame displays a vast mountainous panorama under a clear blue sky, with a prominent, rugged rocky peak covered in vibrant green grass dominating the foreground-midground. To its left, a sun-drenched green ridge extends into the distance, while layered blue mountains form the far horizon in front of the viewer.
end of description
The camera gradually pans right, causing the central peak to shift subtly left relative to the frame while revealing more expansive green slopes and rocky formations to its right, all remaining in front of the original viewpoint. As the movement continues, the grassy terrain immediately beside the initial peak becomes more prominent, showcasing additional peaks and valleys further to the right. A brief lens flare also appears in the top-left sky.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a rugged, grassy mountain ridge dominates the midground, extending from the lower left towards the upper right, with its steep rocky face prominent to the viewer's immediate right. Beyond this ridge, to the left, green valleys and distant mountain ranges recede into a hazy horizon, while to the right, more forested and rocky peaks are visible further back. The upper half of the frame is a clear, bright blue sky with a faint lens flare in the upper left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera moves forward and slightly upward, tracking along the crest of the prominent mountain ridge. This motion reveals more of the grassy, rocky terrain directly ahead on the ridge's path, and a discernible dirt trail becomes increasingly visible on its surface, previously hidden from the first-frame viewpoint. The surrounding mountainous landscape to the left and right remains visible but recedes further into the background.
