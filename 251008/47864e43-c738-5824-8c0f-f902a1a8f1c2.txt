The first frame displays a lively outdoor shopping promenade. In the immediate foreground, a man in a black mask and t-shirt walks left to right, while a group of three, including a man in blue shorts and mask, walk right to left. To the left is a large white wall adorned with a fashion advertisement featuring a leg and shoe, along with "DIOR" text. On the right, a dark-bricked storefront with illuminated windows, displaying "RRL & CO." and "RALPH'S BAR" signs, lines the path. A tall, dark pillar stands centrally on the tiled walkway, and above, a second-story walkway with people is visible.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves steadily forward through the promenade. The initial foreground pedestrians pass by, with the man on the left exiting the frame and the group from the right continuing towards and past the viewer. This movement reveals more of the "COMING SOON" and "I.T" advertisement on the left wall, and new masked pedestrians emerge from the background on the right, approaching the viewer. The central pillar and elements of the background shift proportionally to the viewer's forward progression, showcasing more of the shops lining the right side.
