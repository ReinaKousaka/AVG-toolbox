The viewer is positioned within a covered pedestrian shopping arcade, looking down a central walkway that recedes into the distance. To the immediate right, a shop with wooden doors, a hanging curtain, and two yellow stools features a large menu board in front. On the left, a bright "A-PRICE" store with a green-framed facade is partially cordoned off by a red barrier rope, beside which a white three-wheeled delivery scooter and several bicycles are parked. A man in a white shirt stands near the scooter, while other pedestrians walk further down the central walkway, which is lined with numerous shops, signs, and hanging banners under a ribbed ceiling.
end of description
From the initial viewpoint, the man in the white shirt near the scooter on the left turns to face away from the viewer and begins walking further down the central walkway. Simultaneously, a person on a bicycle on the far left moves deeper into the "A-PRICE" store. Pedestrians in the midground and background continue their movement, walking further away from the viewer down the arcade.

The first frame captures a covered shopping arcade looking forward, featuring a white delivery tricycle with a person standing next to it on the foreground left, a tall food signboard on the foreground right, and several pedestrians walking deeper into the scene on a tiled path.
end of description
Following frames show the person on the left pushing the delivery tricycle forward and slightly right relative to its initial position, while pedestrians further down the arcade continue to recede. Concurrently, a group of people previously in the mid-distance approaches the viewer along the central pathway, transitioning from mid-ground towards the foreground.

In the first frame, a covered shopping arcade stretches directly away from the viewer. On the immediate left foreground, the torso of a person in a white shirt and a bicycle wheel are partially visible. A patterned tiled walkway extends into the background, bordered by shop fronts; on the left, a person in dark clothing stands by a shuttered shop displaying Japanese signs, including "A-PRICE", while another in a green shirt walks further away. On the right, a line of shops, some shuttered, feature overhead banners, and a group of pedestrians, prominently a man in a dark jacket and a woman in a black top, walk towards the viewer. The arcade's arched ceiling with lighting spans overhead, leading to a vibrant, sign-filled background.
end of description
The person in the white shirt moves further left and partially out of frame. The couple walking towards the viewer on the right advances, passing directly in front of the viewer and eventually out of frame to the immediate right. Other pedestrians previously behind them continue to move closer towards the viewer, occupying the mid-right space. The person in the green shirt on the left continues walking further into the background, moving away from the viewer.

The first frame depicts a covered shopping arcade with a man in a light shirt walking towards the viewer on the right side of the path, and a blurry figure partially visible at the bottom right. To the left, a man stands by a closed shop looking at his phone, while the arcade stretches into the background lined with shops and banners.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the man initially in the front-right walks past the viewer and exits to the right, followed by the newly clarified woman (from the blurry figure), wearing a blue shirt and carrying a tan bag, who also moves towards and past the viewer, exiting the frame to the right. Meanwhile, people further down the arcade continue walking away from the viewer towards the background.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
A covered shopping arcade stretches into the distance, illuminated by overhead lights and numerous shop signs. In the foreground, a man in a dark hoodie stands on the far left, looking at his phone, positioned next to a beige roll-down shutter and a red Japanese sign with a blue circular traffic sign above it. The central tiled walkway leads into the midground, where several pedestrians walk in various directions, including a person in a green shirt walking away on the left and another man walking towards the viewer on the right. Storefronts with shutters and banners line both sides of the arcade, with a small white bag visible on the ground to the right.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the man on the far left remains relatively stationary, engrossed in his phone. The man walking towards the viewer from the midground on the right side of the central path progressively draws closer, eventually entering the near-foreground while holding a white plastic bag. Other pedestrians in the midground continue their movement further away down the arcade.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a vibrant, covered shopping alley stretching away from the viewer, illuminated by numerous storefronts and overhead banners. In the immediate foreground, a man in a blue shirt walks from right to left, while a person in a green shirt walks directly away into the distance. On the viewer's left, a person in a grey shirt stands near a display, and the right side features a closed shop shutter and a red bicycle, all resting on a tiled floor.
end of description
Through subsequent frames, the man in the blue shirt moves past the viewer and exits the scene to the left, while the green-shirted person continues further into the alley. Simultaneously, a new individual in a brown shirt is revealed standing on the right side of the alley, near the previously seen red bicycle, as a group of people in the midground approaches closer to the viewer.
