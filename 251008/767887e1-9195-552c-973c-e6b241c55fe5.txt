The first frame shows a multi-lane city street viewed from a moving vehicle, with a large blue bus in the immediate left foreground and a blue and white van further ahead in the center lane, flanked by multi-story buildings and parked cars on both sides receding into the hazy distance.
end of description
As frames progress, the blue bus moves left out of view, revealing more of the sidewalk and parked vehicles on the left side of the viewer's original position. New vehicles, including a scooter with a rider and several cars, emerge from the background on the left side of the road, moving towards and then past the initial camera position. The street light pole, initially in the middle-left, moves closer to the viewer and then upward out of frame, while the blue and white van slowly recedes further down the street, indicating continuous forward motion.

The first frame depicts a city street with a gray asphalt road extending forward, featuring a blue and white van centrally ahead. To the left, a sidewalk has pedestrians, a white pickup, a scooter, multi-story buildings with trees, and a prominent streetlamp further down. To the right, parked cars line a sidewalk next to more multi-story buildings with shops and pedestrians.

Subsequently, the blue and white van moves further ahead, away from the first-frame viewpoint. On the left, the streetlamp, all pedestrians (including a newly revealed person carrying bags), and the scooter rider move progressively past the initial viewpoint, with a large red and white truck becoming visible further ahead on the left, also passing.

In the first frame, a man walks away from the viewer on the far left sidewalk, holding a white bag. Directly in front, a light blue and white van faces away from the viewer on a multi-lane street. To the left, a light pole with a green sign stands beside the sidewalk, behind which are parked vehicles, a person on a moped, and multi-story buildings with trees. To the right, more parked cars line the street, leading to a continuous row of multi-story buildings. The street extends into the background, flanked by buildings on both sides under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward along the street. The man on the far left moves out of frame, and the light pole with the green sign passes to the left of the viewer, revealing more of the street ahead. Additional vehicles, including other vans and cars, appear behind and alongside the blue and white van which remains generally ahead, while more pedestrians and parked cars become visible further down the street on both sides. The buildings on either side progressively reveal more of their facades and ground-floor shops as the viewpoint advances.
