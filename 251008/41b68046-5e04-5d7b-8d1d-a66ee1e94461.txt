The first frame captures a multi-story building in the evening, directly in front of the viewer. To the left, a row of bright streetlights illuminates dense green trees lining the street, where several cars are partially visible. The building's lower levels feature a light-colored, ornate stone facade with a large arched entrance in the center-right, flanked by two flags and smaller trees. Its upper floors are darker with numerous windows, some illuminated, and a tall palm tree stands in front of the building to the right of the arch.
end of description. The camera slowly pans right and slightly zooms in, gradually moving the leafy trees and streetlights from the far left out of the frame to the viewer's left. Concurrently, more of the building's upper facade and its lower right side, initially to the right of the first frame's center, become increasingly visible and central. The prominent palm tree remains in the midground as the perspective shifts further right, and vehicles on the street below dynamically change their positions in front of the building.

The first frame displays a nighttime view of a tall, multi-story building facade, illuminated by streetlights. A prominent, light-colored base with a large arched entrance is centrally positioned, slightly to the viewer's left. A tall palm tree stands directly in front of the building, just to the right of the arch, while flags (including an American flag) hang to the arch's left. Further right, a dense green tree and a section of the building with arched windows are visible, and green foliage from another tree appears at the far left and top. Many windows on the upper, darker stories are dimly lit.

end of description

The camera slowly pans to the viewer's left, gradually revealing more of the building's facade and street features that were previously located immediately to the left of the first frame's visible area. As the pan continues, the palm tree and the dense green tree initially on the right side of the first frame shift towards the right edge and eventually move out of sight. New storefronts, additional streetlights, and parked vehicles emerge into view from the left, extending the street scene further along to the left of where the arched entrance was initially centered.
