The first frame shows a wet asphalt road reflecting city lights at night, extending into the distance. On the viewer's right, a dark blue pickup truck is parked on the sidewalk next to some white bundled objects. To the left, a black car is parked on the street in front of multiple illuminated storefronts, including a "Subway" restaurant. Multi-story buildings line both sides of the street, and streetlights are visible overhead, with traffic lights showing red and green further down the road.

A yellow truck subsequently appears in the midground, entering from the right side of the street and traveling left, passing behind the stationary blue pickup truck. This yellow truck then continues driving across the main road, moving towards the left. A white car briefly emerges in the far left lane, moving towards the viewer from the distance, as the yellow truck proceeds further left and exits the scene.
