The first frame displays an outdoor restaurant patio covered by a large light-colored canopy, featuring numerous empty tables draped in red tablecloths with matching wicker chairs extending from the midground into the background. To the far left, a man in a white shirt leans over a wooden counter, near a wooden lectern, while another individual is partially seated at a table closer to the viewer. Beyond the covered seating area, lush green foliage and trees are visible through glass panels in the background.

Following frames show the man on the far left slightly adjusting his position. A new man in a white shirt enters from the far right background of the initial frame, progressively walking across the restaurant space towards the left midground relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
