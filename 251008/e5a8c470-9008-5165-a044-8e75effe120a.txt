The viewer is inside a boat cabin, looking forward. A woman in a blue and white striped shirt and straw hat stands in the mid-ground, facing away, with a cream L-shaped sofa and a wooden table to her left. To her right are two captain's chairs and a helm station, beyond which large windows reveal a sunny marina with boats, water, and distant city buildings.
end of description
The woman slowly walks forward towards the front left of the cabin, gradually revealing more of the helm station and its instruments, located to the right of her initial position. She then turns to her left, pivoting towards the sofa, eventually making her face visible to the viewer.
