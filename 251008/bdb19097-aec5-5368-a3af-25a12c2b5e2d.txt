The first frame presents a wet city street at night, with a brick sidewalk on the right leading to illuminated storefronts and a green poster. To the left, a glistening asphalt road with a crosswalk stretches into the distance, where a dark car with headlights is partially visible amidst buildings adorned with neon signs.

The viewpoint subtly shifts right, revealing additional white and black advertising posters on the rightmost storefront, previously obscured. A dark trash bin, positioned behind the central pole and to its left relative to the original viewing axis, also becomes visible. Concurrently, the dark car on the road advances forward and further away from the initial viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a wet city street and sidewalk at night, illuminated by streetlights and building signs. A prominent utility pole stands in the left-center foreground, with a black kiosk and bags of trash situated behind it on the sidewalk, while a bright green advertising board is visible on the right next to a building entrance. Illuminated buildings line both sides of the street, and distant cars are visible on the wet asphalt, reflecting the ambient light.

Across subsequent frames, the foreground utility pole and the black kiosk on the sidewalk progressively disappear, expanding the view to the left. This reveals more of the wet street, distant buildings, and a black car parked further along the street to the left. The ambient light and rain continue, with a "Rain Everyday" watermark appearing in the bottom left corner towards the end.

The first frame shows a wet street and sidewalk at night, illuminated by streetlights and building signs. To the viewer's immediate right, a green signboard with drink advertisements leans against a building with a dark entrance panel. On the left, a multi-paneled advertising board stands next to a streetlight pole, at the base of which are several trash bags. In the midground, a dark vehicle is parked on the wet street, with multiple trees lining the sidewalk. The background features more distant buildings with glowing signs and traffic lights.

Throughout the sequence, rain visibly falls, creating reflective puddles on the street and sidewalk. A white car moves from the far left of the street in the background, appearing in frame 5, and gradually drives past the midground parked vehicle, exiting the frame to the right by frame 8. In the final frames, a small "Rain Everyday" watermark appears in the bottom-left corner.
