In the first frame, a prominent brown house with a reddish roof and green shutters occupies the left foreground, with a smaller brown house positioned behind it on a green grassy slope to the right. A village of numerous houses is visible further back on a tree-covered hillside, set against a towering, light-colored rocky cliff face in the background, from which a waterfall descends on the far left.

The camera then slowly pans right, gradually revealing more of the distant village and hillside, including a new, larger building on the far right relative to the initial view. As the pan continues, a small bare tree also emerges on the right side of the grassy slope, while the waterfall on the far left progressively recedes from view.
