In the first frame, a narrow asphalt road extends into the distance, with buildings lining both sides under an overcast sky. To the immediate right, a building features a light beige lower half with a red and white striped barrier, and a gray vertical wooden paneled upper half with windows, a blue garage door, and two large gray trash bins in front. Further down the street on the left, a white car is visible next to a building with wooden siding, partially obscured by foliage. A tall, thin metal structure stands in the mid-distance slightly right of center.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The buildings on both the right and left sides become closer, revealing more of their facades and surroundings previously further down the street from the initial position. The blue garage door and the trash bins on the right move out of view to the right, and a new section of the right-hand building with gray vertical panels becomes visible. A black motorcycle is newly revealed on the left, parked in front of the building with wooden siding, next to the white car that also moves closer.
