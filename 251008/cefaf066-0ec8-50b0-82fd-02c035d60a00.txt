The first frame depicts a cobblestone pathway stretching into the distance, bordered by long, rectangular planters filled with dense green bushes on both sides. To the left, several open dark grey restaurant umbrellas with wooden supports extend above the bushes. In the background, a multi-story, light-colored building with windows and dark shutters is visible above the pathway and umbrellas, while green tree foliage is prominent in the upper left and upper right corners.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the cobblestone path. The green bushes in the foreground on both sides appear to recede, revealing more of the path ahead and clearer views of the street scene. Pedestrian figures, initially indistinct in the distant mid-ground of the first frame, become slightly more defined as they walk towards the viewer on the path. The background building and distant street remain generally in their positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint, but appear closer as the camera advances.

The first frame presents a paved outdoor walkway bordered by rows of green bushes in planters on both sides, with two dark cafe umbrellas partially visible on the left. In the distant background, a pale yellow building lines a street where a blue car and a few small figures are just discernible.
end of description
Over the subsequent frames, the camera subtly moves forward along the path. The blue car in the background gradually disappears as it moves further away, while several new individuals emerge and walk further into the distance along the street, and a light-colored umbrella on the mid-right becomes more visible.

A paved pedestrian street stretches into the distance, bordered by dense green foliage in planters on both sides. On the left, a dark outdoor umbrella is visible, while a lighter one is partially seen on the right, with a lush tree canopy overhead. In the midground, several people are walking along the path and a bicycle is parked on the right, with multi-story buildings lining the street in the background.
end of description
Over the subsequent frames, the camera subtly shifts its perspective, revealing slightly more of the immediate foreground pavement and periphery of the scene. All visible elements, including the foliage, umbrellas, buildings, and the distant people and bicycle, remain largely static in their positions relative to the initial frame's viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a paved pedestrian walkway extending forward, flanked by lush green hedges in planters on the left and various green bushes and small trees in planters on the right, leading towards a street lined with buildings and people in the distance. To the immediate left is a dark outdoor umbrella, while further down the right side, several bicycles are parked; buildings with yellow and light-colored facades rise behind the foliage on both sides of the street.
end of description
A white car initially in the mid-ground on the left side of the street moves forward and then out of frame to the left, while people in the mid-distance are seen moving and gathering. In later frames, a person's shoulder and head briefly appear on the far left, moving past the viewer, and a red 'M' Metro sign becomes visible on the building facade on the distant right.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows the back of a person's head and left shoulder in the immediate foreground, obscuring the left side. To the left and right, closer to the viewer, are dense green bushes. A cobblestone path extends forward into the midground, flanked by a hedge on the left and a tree canopy overhead on the right. Further down the path, numerous people are visible, some walking and others standing near a line of parked bicycles on the right. Buildings line both sides of the street, with a light-colored building featuring a red 'M' metro sign and a 'BALLY' storefront sign prominent on the right in the midground, while more buildings recede into the distance under a bright sky.
end of description
The person in the foreground walks forward, gradually revealing their entire back and the text on their black t-shirt, which reads "ARCTIC MONKEYS" and a list of tour dates for "SUMMER 2023". The street scene, including the buildings, people, and bicycles, remains consistently in front of the first-frame viewpoint, only becoming slightly more prominent as the foreground subject moves away from the camera.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A person in a black "ARCTIC MONKEYS" t-shirt walks away from the viewer on a cobblestone street, flanked by green foliage planters and an umbrella to the left. Ahead, the street features parked bicycles, pedestrians, and buildings housing a "BALLY" store and a red 'M' subway sign on the right.
end of description
As the central figure proceeds forward, the scene opens up, revealing more of the street ahead. Pedestrians further down the street subtly change positions, and a person sitting on a bench to the viewer's right becomes fully visible, alongside a newly revealed advertising billboard positioned further right on the sidewalk.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts an urban street scene with a man in a black t-shirt and a dark apron-like garment standing with his back to the viewer on a cobblestone sidewalk in the foreground. To his right, a row of parked bicycles lines the path, while beyond them, pedestrians, multi-story buildings with storefronts (including "BALLY"), and a red "M" metro sign are visible. Green leaves from a tree overhang the scene from the upper right, and a dark vertical display stand is present on the far right, partially obscuring a person.
end of description
Across the sequence, a person wearing a yellow top and white pants, initially largely obscured by the dark display stand on the far right, gradually comes into fuller view as the viewpoint subtly shifts right, revealing more of their upper body.
