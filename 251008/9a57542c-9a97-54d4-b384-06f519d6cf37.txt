The viewer is on a paved road flanked by buildings on the left and a natural rock wall on the right, under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left, a red building with black wrought-iron balconies has an open doorway revealing a person partially inside. Further along the curving road on the left, more colorful buildings in yellow and red recede into the distance. On the right, a steep rock face covered in green foliage borders the street, with several scooters parked along the curb and a person standing near them. In the mid-distance, a white van is visible on the road, with a tree-covered hill rising in the background.

In the following frames, the person in the doorway on the left recedes further inside the building. The white van, initially in the distance, steadily approaches the viewer along the road. Concurrently, the person by the scooters on the right bends down and then moves out of the frame to the right. The overall viewpoint subtly advances forward along the street.
