The initial frame depicts a modern two-story house with light stucco walls and dark grey trim, featuring a small tree centered in the grassy foreground and a concrete driveway leading to a grey garage door on the right. The house's dark front door with vertical glass panels is to the left of the tree, flanked by stone veneer columns, with dark-framed windows on both floors and a cloudy sky overhead.

As the viewer approaches and shifts slightly right, the central tree appears larger and moves left within the frame, and the house number "5511" becomes clearly visible on the left stone column. The front entrance, initially appearing as a distinct door, is revealed to be a large dark window or sliding door as the perspective changes.
