The first frame displays a scenic mountain road winding forward under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds. In the foreground, shadows fall on the asphalt road, which features a white dashed center line. To the left, a silver guardrail runs alongside the road, behind which a light-colored building with a corrugated roof is partially visible, flanked by a tall evergreen tree and distant blue mountains. To the right, a stone retaining wall borders a steep, heavily wooded hillside.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the guardrail, building, and large evergreen tree on the left progressively recede to the viewer's left and behind. Simultaneously, the stone retaining wall on the right moves to the viewer's right and behind. A metal gate structure then emerges on the right side of the road, becoming fully visible before also receding to the right, as the winding road ahead continues to reveal itself.
