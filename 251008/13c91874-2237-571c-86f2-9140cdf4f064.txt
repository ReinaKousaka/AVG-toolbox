The first frame shows a street scene with a white SUV parked in the foreground left and a white commercial van, an "ACE ENDICO" delivery vehicle, parked behind it. On the right, a dark-paneled building with large windows lines the sidewalk, where a person in a grey shirt and dark pants walks away from the viewer in the mid-ground. Tall multi-story buildings stretch into the background on the left under a clear blue sky, with a road running between the parked vehicles and the buildings.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the person walks further away from the viewer, moving down the sidewalk towards the background. The parked white SUV and the ACE ENDICO van remain stationary on the left, and the buildings along the street also stay in their initial positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame displays a sunny city street with a wide paved sidewalk extending into the distance on the right, bordered by a building featuring dark-framed windows and decorative pillars. To the viewer's left, a white service van (ACE ENDICO) is parked alongside the curb, partially obscuring another white van (Spectrum) further down the street, both adjacent to multistory brick buildings. A person in a grey shirt and dark pants is walking on the sidewalk towards the left, positioned between the viewer and the first van. end of description. The person continues to walk left, moving past the viewer and out of the frame, while the overall viewpoint subtly advances forward, progressively revealing more of the street and buildings ahead.

The first frame depicts a sunny city street looking forward along a concrete sidewalk, with a building featuring dark-framed windows and an awning stretching along the right from the foreground into the mid-ground. To the viewer's left, a white van is partially visible in the immediate foreground, followed by a parked white Spectrum van and other vehicles on a cobblestone road, flanked by multi-story buildings that line the street into the distance.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, a shadow originating from the viewer's left foreground gradually shifts and recedes across the sidewalk towards the right as the viewpoint subtly moves forward.

A white Spectrum van is visible in the foreground to the left, parked on a cobblestone street. Behind it, further to the left, a yellow truck with ladders and a white USPS truck are partially visible. A concrete sidewalk stretches from the immediate foreground, center-left, extending straight ahead into the distance. To the right, a dark-colored building with multiple large, dark-framed windows and an overhead awning runs alongside the sidewalk, extending into the midground. Several black bollards line the left edge of the sidewalk, and a street sign pole with multiple signs is further ahead. In the background, tall urban buildings line both sides of the street under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the sidewalk. The Spectrum van and other vehicles initially to the left of the first-frame viewpoint appear to recede and eventually move behind the current viewer's position, thus moving further left and behind the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, new sections of the sidewalk and the dark-windowed building on the right, which were previously further ahead of the first-frame viewpoint, are revealed and become closer. The distant street and buildings ahead of the initial viewpoint also draw nearer as the perspective advances.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a sunny city street looking forward, with a white Spectrum van parked at the lower left. A concrete sidewalk extends centrally into the distance, flanked on the right by a dark building facade with multiple glass windows and a black awning, and on the left by a street with parked cars, a USPS truck, and various street signs. Tall buildings line the background under a blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the Spectrum van on the far left moves forward and exits the scene from the lower left. Simultaneously, the viewer advances along the sidewalk, bringing the dark building facade on the right closer and revealing more architectural details of its intricate windows and a wall lamp. The vehicles initially to the left of the viewer become more distant as the perspective moves forward.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a city street from a sidewalk perspective, revealing a street on the left with parked vehicles (a black SUV and white USPS truck), traffic bollards, and a multi-story building, alongside a prominent street sign. Straight ahead, the sidewalk extends past an outdoor dining structure ("COMMON GROUND NYC") and distant buildings, while to the right, a building with dark-framed windows reflects the scene under an awning.
end of description
As the frames advance, the camera moves forward along the sidewalk, bringing the street sign on the left and the building on the right closer. A white van also becomes visible in the far left of the street, appearing beyond the previously parked vehicles.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a street scene with a white street sign prominently on the immediate left, partially obscuring a white van and a USPS truck parked behind it, adjacent to an outdoor dining structure labeled 'COMMON GROUND NYC' further along the street. To the right, a building with dark-framed windows and an awning extends from the right edge, while more city buildings line the street into the background.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward, causing the initial street sign, white van, and USPS truck to recede and eventually exit the frame on the left. As the camera progresses, the 'COMMON GROUND NYC' structure and the building on the right with dark windows pass by, revealing new sections of the sidewalk and another outdoor dining area further down the street on the right.
