The first frame depicts a narrow city street, with a dark pickup truck and a silver sedan in the left foreground, a white sedan directly ahead, and a grey sedan on the right, all surrounded by parked cars, buildings, and trees under a hazy sky.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the initial foreground vehicles gradually exit the frame to the sides and behind the viewer. A large white pickup truck with a dark cargo container replaces the silver sedan on the left, while a blue Pepsi truck and a person with a yellow-laden cart appear further down the street to the left of the central white sedan. New pedestrians and vehicles continually emerge from the vanishing point ahead, passing to the sides as more distant city buildings become progressively clearer.
