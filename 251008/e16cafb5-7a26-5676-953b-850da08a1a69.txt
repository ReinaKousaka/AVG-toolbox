In the first frame, a bustling night market scene unfolds. In the immediate foreground to the right, a person in a dark cap partially holds a menu board with Chinese text. Extending across the midground from left to right is a food stall laden with rows of light brown, thick vegetables topped with green leaves, alongside numerous skewered meats behind a clear barrier. Behind the stall, two vendors are actively grilling food, with the rightmost vendor, wearing a black cap and apron, prominently turning items on a grill from which steam rises. To the midground left, a crowded walkway features multiple people, including one person in a white shirt walking away from the viewer. The background reveals more illuminated stalls and market activity.

From the second frame, a "A WALK CHINA" watermark appears in the bottom-left corner. Throughout the sequence, the vendor on the right continues to cook food on the grill, frequently turning skewers, which causes steam to visibly plume upwards from the stall. The vendor to her left also tends to items on the grill within the stall area. Simultaneously, the people in the walkway to the midground-left continue to move further away from the viewer, deeper into the market scene. Additionally, more skewers of food are gradually added to the grill by the vendors.
