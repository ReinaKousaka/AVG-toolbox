The first frame captures a rainy night on a city street, bustling with pedestrians under umbrellas. A person holding a light blue umbrella occupies the left foreground, partially obscuring a shop's "SALE" signs, while further right, a person with a black umbrella walks away. The midground features numerous people walking down a wet pavement, flanked by illuminated Japanese shopfronts on the left and a "SUBNADE" building with a blue sign on the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, all pedestrians continuously move away from the viewer down the wet street. The foreground figures holding the light blue and black umbrellas proceed further into the distance, revealing more of the "SALE" signs on the left storefront. A group previously in the midground—consisting of a man with a clear umbrella, a woman in a hijab with a black umbrella, and a child—moves closer to the viewer's original position. Eventually, a new person in a light jacket, previously obscured, emerges on the far left by the storefront, looking at a phone.

The first frame shows a wet city street at night, with a person partially visible in the left foreground holding a phone. Ahead, a person with a large clear umbrella walks away from the viewer in the center-right, while another dark umbrella is partially visible in the far right foreground. The tiled sidewalk, featuring a yellow tactile strip, extends into the distance, flanked by brightly lit buildings with Japanese signage on both sides, and more pedestrians are visible further down the street.
end of description
The person with the clear umbrella gradually moves further away down the street. Subsequently, a person holding a black umbrella and wearing a light headscarf emerges from the right foreground, walking towards the viewer. Simultaneously, another individual with a yellow backpack and a polka-dotted umbrella appears in the mid-distance, walking away down the left side of the street. As these individuals continue moving past the initial viewpoint, the illuminated sign on the left building dynamically changes its display to clearly advertise an "Autumn Sale." The left storefront interior also becomes more visible, revealing merchandise shelves as the scene progresses.

The first frame displays a rainy city street at night, with a blue storefront building featuring display windows and a partially visible yellow "Sale" sign on the far left. A wet, tiled sidewalk with a yellow tactile strip extends from the foreground into the distance, populated by numerous pedestrians holding umbrellas, with one large black umbrella with white dots prominent in the mid-right. In the background, illuminated buildings, streetlights, and signs with Japanese text line the busy urban street under a dark sky.
end of description
As frames progress, the viewpoint subtly advances forward along the sidewalk. The person with the yellow backpack and black umbrella moves further away and exits to the right. More pedestrians with umbrellas, including a man in a blue puffer jacket and a woman in a blue poncho, emerge into the mid-ground and continue walking away from the viewer, revealing additional details of the busy street and illuminated storefronts in the background.

On a rainy night, the left side of the frame shows a blue-tiled building with a large food poster and glowing Japanese signs along a wet sidewalk. In the right midground, a person in a blue poncho faces the viewer, adjusting their hood, with another person holding a white umbrella just behind them. The street extends into the background, bustling with many umbrella-carrying pedestrians and illuminated buildings.
end of description
The person in the blue poncho moves right and exits the frame, followed by the individual with the white umbrella also moving right. Simultaneously, a new person with a dark umbrella and an orange-trimmed jacket enters from the right midground, moving towards the right foreground, as the first-frame viewpoint shifts slightly right and forward, revealing more of the building's facade on the left and causing the blue pillar from the extreme left to exit the frame.

The first frame depicts a rainy night scene on a city sidewalk, with a low-angle viewpoint. To the immediate left, a dark blue tiled building facade features large glass windows displaying food images and multiple Japanese signs, including a partially visible one nearest the viewer. A yellow awning extends from the building into the midground, above further illuminated shop windows. A patterned pedestrian sidewalk, bisected by a yellow tactile strip, stretches into the distance, crowded with numerous people holding umbrellas (clear, white, and dark blue) and walking in both directions. In the background, a bustling city street wet from rain is lined with multi-story buildings adorned with myriad illuminated Japanese signs and billboards, under a dark night sky with distant vehicles.

end of description

The prominent pedestrian holding a clear umbrella, initially on the mid-right, moves progressively closer to the viewer, traversing the foreground from right to left. Concurrently, a person in a dark jacket with a black umbrella, initially further down the right sidewalk, also advances closer to the viewer. As the first pedestrian exits the lower left of the frame, a new individual with a dark blue umbrella and wearing a grey hoodie and shorts emerges from the mid-right. This newly revealed pedestrian then walks towards the viewer on the right side of the sidewalk. All other visible pedestrians in the mid-ground continue their movement along the sidewalk and street, while the background cityscape remains largely stationary.

The first frame captures a busy, rainy night street scene with a brightly lit food stall, bearing "TAIYAKI" signage and a yellow awning, dominating the left foreground, alongside a woman holding a clear umbrella. Pedestrians with various umbrellas traverse the wet street and sidewalk, extending into the midground and background, flanked by multi-story buildings adorned with numerous illuminated signs and reflections on the ground.

end of description

As frames progress, the woman by the stall turns to face deeper into the scene, walking away from the viewer and further along the left sidewalk. A man carrying a dark umbrella and bag, initially in the midground right, moves past the viewer towards the right. Simultaneously, other individuals on the street and sidewalk shift their positions, and a dark car appears, driving leftward across the background street.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a busy, rainy city street at night, with a brightly lit storefront featuring Japanese lanterns and promotional signs lining the left side. In the immediate foreground to the left, part of a person holding a clear umbrella is visible, while a crowd of individuals, mostly under umbrellas of various colors, occupies the wet sidewalk extending into the midground. Tall, illuminated city buildings stand in the background, their lights reflecting on the dark, wet street where a faint vehicle can be seen on the far right.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly pans to the right and subtly moves forward, gradually revealing more of the illuminated storefront on the left. This movement brings new Japanese promotional signs into full view, notably one detailing a "Tonkatsu set meal." Concurrently, people on the crowded, rainy sidewalk continue to move, with some individuals in the foreground on the right exiting the frame as others in the midground shift their positions.
