The first frame depicts a cityscape at dusk, with a woman walking away from the viewer on a wide paved sidewalk in the foreground-right, passing a curved building facade decorated with blue and white geometric patterns and 'BLUE FIN BUILDING' text, while other pedestrians, a line of red bikes, and trees are visible further left along the path, against a backdrop of tall modern buildings.

Over the subsequent frames, the woman continues to walk forward, gradually moving from the mid-right to the far-right of the original viewpoint, as she progresses along the sidewalk. Other pedestrians in the distance, to the left of her path, also advance or recede, maintaining their positions relative to the overall street scene.

The person on the right walks further away from the viewer, gradually exiting the frame towards the right side. Simultaneously, the person on the left walks closer to the viewer, also moving towards the left side of the frame and eventually getting much closer.

In the first frame, a paved pedestrian walkway stretches into the distance, flanked by a long row of red rental bicycles on the left and a modern building with large glass windows and prominent grey pillars on the right. A person in a dark top and blue jeans walks away from the viewer on the far right, while an older building and street with cars are visible to the far left, beyond the bicycles.

end of description
Subsequently, the person in the foreground continues walking forward along the walkway, moving further away from the initial viewpoint and towards the right side of the frame. Other pedestrians in the mid-ground also advance further down the path, and a black car emerges from the mid-ground right to drive across the street towards the left, passing behind the row of bicycles relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

To the left, a long row of red rental bikes lines the sidewalk, separated from the road by several trees. Cars are visible on the street to the left, some with illuminated headlights, while modern glass buildings with large pillars and bright entrances stand on the right in the background. Older buildings are present on the left side of the street, further into the background.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the woman on the right continues to walk further away from the viewer, while the woman approaching in the midground moves closer to the viewer. Concurrently, cars on the street to the left exhibit subtle movement, with one car's headlights noticeably drawing nearer from the background.

The first frame depicts a wide city sidewalk with a row of red Santander bicycles parked on the left foreground and a person in blue walking away on the right foreground. To the left, a street with traffic and older buildings recedes, while a modern glass-fronted building with columns stands prominently on the right midground, where several pedestrians are also visible.
end of description
As frames progress, the person on the right continues walking forward away from the viewer, while the individual near the bicycles on the left foreground bends down and then straightens, appearing to interact with a bike. Other pedestrians in the midground also move slightly forward.
