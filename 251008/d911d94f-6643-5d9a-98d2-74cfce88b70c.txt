The first frame presents a nighttime view of a wet park pathway leading into an illuminated urban landscape. A paved path, brightly reflecting city lights, extends from the viewer's foreground into the midground. To the immediate left, two empty wooden benches are visible, while a wet, earthy patch lies to the path's right. In the midground, a person in a light-colored coat walks away along the path, past a tall streetlight on the right. A large, well-lit building occupies the far left background, with additional city lights and bare trees defining the distant urban backdrop under a dark, possibly rainy sky.

As the frames progress, the person on the path continues to walk further away from the viewer, moving deeper into the midground and slightly to the right. Concurrently, a red vehicle emerges in the background, traversing horizontally from left to right behind the trees and distant buildings. The wet ground subtly shimmers, indicating continuous rainfall or wind across the scene.

The first frame displays a wet, reflective paved pathway extending from the bottom towards the center, flanked by a dirt/grass path to its right and a wooden bench in the bottom-left. A tall, illuminated building is visible on the far left, with a smaller white building on the right, under a dark, stormy sky brightened by a distant lightning flash in the background. Streetlights, bare trees, and bushes populate the midground.

A person holding a white umbrella dynamically appears on the dirt path in the midground to the right, walking further away from the viewer in subsequent frames. Simultaneously, the prominent lightning flash in the distant background gradually fades.

The first frame depicts a wet, nighttime urban landscape. A dark, reflective paved path extends from the viewer into the mid-distance, flanked by brown-toned wet ground and garden beds. To the far left, a large modern glass building with illuminated windows stands tall, with bare trees, bushes, and a green sign positioned in front of it. In the mid-ground, several streetlights illuminate a road where distant vehicle lights are visible, while a person holding a white umbrella walks away on the right side of the path, towards a white building in the background. The scene is under a dark, city-light-tinted sky.

end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the person with the white umbrella continues walking further away on the path to the right. A red vehicle becomes visible on the road in the mid-ground left, then moves further right across the scene, appearing behind the bushes from the first frame's perspective. Subsequently, a yellow bus enters the frame from the far left, moving right across the same mid-ground road, passing behind the existing trees and bushes, and also moving away from the viewer.
