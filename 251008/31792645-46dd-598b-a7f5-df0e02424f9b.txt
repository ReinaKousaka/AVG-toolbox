First frame: A brown BMW SUV is parked close to the viewer on the immediate left of a street that curves right, leading towards distant mountains under a bright sun. To the viewer's left, a stone retaining wall and a modern multi-story building with balconies ascend, while a traditional white building lines the right side of the street.
end of description.
As the viewer moves forward, the SUV recedes to the left, revealing more of the retaining wall and its details. The modern building on the left and the traditional building on the right draw closer, unveiling more of their lower facades and street-level businesses as the perspective advances down the street.

The first frame depicts a street extending forward towards distant mountains and a bright sun, flanked by a multi-story building with ground-level shops (including 'BIOHAUS') and parked cars on the left, and an older building on the right. A stone retaining wall and a yellow/blue bin are visible in the lower-left foreground.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the street, the previously visible yellow/blue bin recedes and moves slightly right relative to the viewer. New signs like "CERTINA" and "Uhrn Goldschmiede" are revealed on the left building, replacing "BIOHAUS" as the viewer advances past the initial shops. The parked cars on the left and the building on the right gain more detail, indicating continuous forward motion.

A silver station wagon is partially visible in the left foreground, followed by a blue hatchback parked further down the street. A multi-story building with balconies and ground-floor shops lines the left side of the street, while a lighter-colored building with floral displays runs along the right. A sun-drenched street extends away from the viewer, with parked cars visible on both sides, leading towards distant mountains under a bright blue sky.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the silver station wagon in the left foreground recedes and exits the frame to the left. The blue hatchback behind it becomes fully visible and then also recedes, revealing more of the shopfronts along the multi-story building on the left. Concurrently, the parked cars on the right side of the street, including a dark SUV and later a burgundy sedan, become more distinct as they too recede into the distance, signifying the viewer's progression along the street.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a street extending forward, flanked by buildings; a multi-story structure with balconies and a 'Heller' storefront, with cars parked along the curb, occupies the left side, while more buildings and cars are on the right, all leading towards a sunlit mountain range in the distance under a blue sky.
end of description.
As the camera moves forward, the street pavement and parked cars on both sides progressively recede backward relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, new sections of the road, more distant cars, and additional storefront details, including a person entering the 'Heller' shop on the left, are revealed in the forward view, while the distant mountain scene remains ahead.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a sunny street ascending towards mountains, flanked by buildings and parked cars. A grey hatchback, black hatchback, and dark blue car are visible on the left, while a dark grey minivan and red SUV occupy the right side.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the initial parked cars gradually exit the frame from their respective sides; the grey and black cars on the left depart, followed by the dark blue car, while the red SUV and dark grey minivan on the right also recede. Subsequently, a silver minivan emerges further right from the initial right-side parking area, and two blue bags appear on the middle-left sidewalk, as the buildings become more fully visible.

The first frame presents a street leading towards a sunlit mountain in the background, with a cream multi-story building on the viewer's left and a darker building with awnings on the viewer's right; a partial blue car and blue bags are at the bottom left foreground.
end of description
As the frames advance, the blue car and bags initially at the bottom left of the first-frame viewpoint move out of sight to the left, while a barbershop pole becomes visible in the left building's storefront. Concurrently, a "30" speed limit marking appears on the road to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, and a person emerges from the background on the right side of the street, walking forward. The viewpoint subtly shifts slightly forward, revealing more of the left building's details as the person on the right continues approaching the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a sunny street, with buildings on both sides; a light-colored building with an awning and a modern grey structure are visible on the left, while a dark building with an awning and a partial view of a person's leg are on the right. Down the road, a white building with a parked black car appears on the right, set against distant buildings ascending a sunlit hill and a blue, cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the person on the far right exits the frame, while a palm tree is revealed behind the initial left building. The modern grey building on the left grows larger, displaying more of its patterned lower facade and balconies. Concurrently, the dark building on the right recedes, allowing the parked black car and the white building behind it to become increasingly prominent as the viewer approaches.
