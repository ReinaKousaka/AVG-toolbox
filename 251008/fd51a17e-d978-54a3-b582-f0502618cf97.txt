The first frame captures a vibrant city street scene at night, viewed from a pedestrian's perspective. In the immediate foreground, a paved surface shows parts of parked scooters on the left and a line of metallic bollards with a red barrier rope on the right, framing several pedestrians, including a man in a dark jacket closest to the viewer. The midground is filled with a dense crowd of people walking, more parked scooters, a tall street light, and large, brightly lit buildings with glass exteriors and trees adorned with string lights on the left, while a multi-story curved building with storefronts dominates the right. Further back, numerous towering city buildings with glowing windows are visible against the dark night sky.

The first frame depicts a busy city street at night, viewed from a pedestrian level. In the immediate foreground, a blurred person's face and shoulder are visible on the bottom right, while a woman in a grey sweatshirt walks in the bottom left-center. A red barrier tape and a row of light-colored bollards extend from the bottom right towards the center, separating the walkway from numerous parked scooters and motorcycles positioned to their right.

As the frames progress, the scene subtly shifts to the right, indicating a slight camera pan or forward movement. The blurred person in the bottom right continues to move out of view, while the woman in the grey sweatshirt and other pedestrians in the midground continually shift positions, walking past the viewer from left to right. This movement reveals new individuals entering the scene from the left and behind the initial foreground figures, while others move further into the distance or exit the frame to the right.
