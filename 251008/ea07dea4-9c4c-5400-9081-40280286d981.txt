First frame shows a vibrant green grassy hillside with a large evergreen tree on the far left and another dominant one near the center-right, flanked by a smaller lighter-green tree. In the midground, a distant village is visible on a far hillside to the left, leading to majestic green mountains under a blue sky with white clouds, hinting at snow-capped peaks to the far right.

The camera slowly pans to the right, causing the leftmost evergreen to exit the frame and the central trees to shift left. As the view progresses, a wooden building with a dark roof gradually emerges from the right, moving into the midground, while more of the snow-capped mountain range becomes visible in the distant background to the far right.
