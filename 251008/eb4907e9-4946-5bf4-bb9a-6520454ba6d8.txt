In the first frame, a large indoor hallway features a light brown tiled floor with a beige mat centrally placed. To the left, a person in a brown coat and black boots is entering through dark-framed glass doors, beneath a green exit sign and beside a red fire alarm. Further right, against a textured wall, are a blue recycling bin, a red sofa, a white bench, and large windows, while two illuminated digital displays showing "EXPERIENCE OUR GIFT" are prominent against a darker textured wall. To the far right, stairs with a light brown handrail ascend, marked by a "First Floor" sign, and concrete beams with lights are visible on the ceiling.
end of description
The person on the left continues to walk through the glass doors, progressively moving deeper into the building and away from the viewer's initial position. Concurrently, the viewpoint subtly shifts right, causing the "First Floor" staircase on the right to become more fully visible and prominent. No new objects are introduced; rather, existing elements on the right side of the scene are simply revealed more completely due to the slight camera adjustment.
