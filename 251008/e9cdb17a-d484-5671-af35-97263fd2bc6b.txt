The first frame displays a narrow dirt path curving gently to the right, flanked by a steep, fern and moss-covered bank on the left, and smaller green plants, a large moss-laden tree trunk, and a dense forest of tall, slender trees further right and in the background.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the path, causing the immediate path, the dense foliage on the left bank, and the smaller plants on the right to continuously shift from the background to the foreground and past the original viewpoint. As the camera advances, the large moss-covered tree trunk on the right slowly recedes, revealing more of the lush, verdant forest beyond and further into the scene.
