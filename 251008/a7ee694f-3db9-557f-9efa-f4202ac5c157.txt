In the first frame, a man in a dark jacket stands in the foreground on the left, facing partially away from the viewer, next to a storefront with reflective glass displaying colorful items. To the right of him, a dark blue Peugeot minivan is parked parallel to the sidewalk, facing away from the viewer. In the far foreground on the right, the rear section of a dark grey car is partially visible. Further down the street, a man in a suit carrying a bag walks towards the viewer on the sidewalk, with a line of parked cars, trees, and distant buildings under a clear blue sky in the background.
end of description
The man in the foreground slowly turns his head and then his upper body to the right, gradually revealing his profile and facing completely away from the viewer by the final frame. Concurrently, the man walking on the sidewalk in the midground continues his approach towards the viewer, growing larger and closer within the scene. The camera also subtly moves forward, causing the foreground man to shift further right out of the frame's left edge, exposing more of the storefront and the street beyond him, relative to the initial viewpoint.

In the first frame, the viewer observes a city street scene. To the immediate right, the back of a person wearing a dark shirt is partially visible, obscuring part of the sidewalk and street. A dark grey van is parked along the sidewalk in the mid-ground right. To the left, a storefront with large reflective windows displays merchandise and the reflection of cars and people across the street, along with a sign "CALENDERS". Further down the street in the background, more parked cars, trees, and distant buildings are visible under a clear blue sky. A man in a dark suit, carrying a bag, is walking towards the viewer on the sidewalk in the mid-ground center-left, with his reflection visible in the shop window.
end of description
As the frames progress, the man walking on the sidewalk moves closer to the viewer, passing by the storefront on the left while his reflection simultaneously moves across the shop window. He continues walking towards the foreground, his figure growing larger relative to the first-frame viewpoint as he approaches. The person in the immediate foreground on the right remains largely stationary, their back still partially obscuring the view, while all other background elements, including the parked vehicles and buildings, stay static.

The first frame captures a sunlit city street scene. To the far left, a building facade with a reflective display window and signs like "Couleurs de table" and the number "20" is visible. A woman with glasses, dressed in a dark jacket and scarf, carrying a yellow bag, is walking away from the viewer on the sidewalk in the mid-ground left. On the right, the side of a dark grey van occupies the foreground, partially obscuring several white cars parked further along the curb, all facing away. In the background, the sidewalk extends into the distance, revealing more pedestrians, parked bicycles, and buildings lined with trees under a clear blue sky.

end of description

The woman in the mid-ground left walks further into the distance along the sidewalk, gradually exiting the frame from the left. The camera simultaneously moves forward, progressively revealing more of the storefront and street details to the left, and more of the white car parked behind the dark van on the right, including its license plate "GG 360 FL". This forward movement shifts the entire visible scene, making additional distant vehicles and street infrastructure more prominent relative to the initial viewpoint.

In the first frame, the viewer is on a sunlit urban sidewalk. To the immediate left is a building with storefronts and signs, while to the right, several parked cars line the street, with a white Toyota prominently in the foreground. Further ahead, the sidewalk continues, populated by pedestrians and bicycles, leading to a wider street with more buildings and trees under a clear blue sky in the distance.
end of description
A person on the left sidewalk walks towards the viewer, becoming more prominent. Simultaneously, another individual emerges from behind the white Toyota on the right, moving diagonally left and further into the scene. Other pedestrians in the mid-ground continue to move along the street, while the parked vehicles remain stationary.

In the first frame, a bustling city street is viewed from a slightly elevated position, looking forward. To the immediate right, the front hood and windshield of a white car are visible. Further back and to the left of this car, a parked white Citroën is seen, with its front facing towards the viewer. A sidewalk runs along the left side of the frame, bordered by a building with several shop signs, including "LE PROGRES" and "TABAC." On the sidewalk, a man in a dark shirt and shorts walks towards the viewer on the left, while a group of people, including a woman and child, walk away from the viewer further down the sidewalk, left of center. The street beyond the parked cars is lined with green-leafed trees, and buildings are visible in the background, primarily on the right side.
end of description
The man on the sidewalk in the foreground left steadily walks towards the viewer. Simultaneously, the group of people walking away on the sidewalk, left of center, continues their progression further into the background. A man carrying a bag appears from the distant right and moves onto the sidewalk, walking towards the viewer. A dark car parked behind the white Citroën, to the right, becomes more distinct as the frames progress.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a man walking towards the viewer in the left foreground, passing a building with a red 'TABAC' sign on the far left. Further back on the left sidewalk, a woman and child also walk towards the viewer. A white Citroen car is parked prominently in the right foreground, with a street, trees, and distant buildings filling the background.
end of description
Subsequently, the man in the left foreground moves past the viewer's left. The woman and child continue approaching, while a man in a hat carrying a patterned bag walks from the mid-ground towards the viewer's right, passing them.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a person walking towards the viewer on the left foreground, carrying a colorful bag, with a light-colored car partially visible on the right foreground. Along the left, a building with storefronts lines a sidewalk where bicycles and a motorcycle are parked further back. The midground features trees, a lamppost, other pedestrians, and a street leading to distant buildings under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the video progresses, the foreground person walks past the viewer and exits the frame to the left, revealing more of the sidewalk and a newly visible crosswalk on the right side of the road. Other pedestrians in the midground become slightly more prominent as they continue walking deeper into the scene.
