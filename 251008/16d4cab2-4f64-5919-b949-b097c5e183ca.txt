The first frame depicts a paved road curving to the right, bordered by a multi-story chalet on the immediate left and two parked cars (a dark blue one closer, a black SUV behind) on the immediate right, with more chalets ascending a verdant hillside under a clear blue sky.

As the viewpoint advances forward and slightly right, the dark blue car on the near right exits the frame, while the black SUV moves further right, revealing a low fence and more of the parking area to its left. The foreground road expands, and the white line outlining the parking space becomes more prominent on the right. The chalet building on the immediate left recedes from the frame's edge, and the perspective shifts, centralizing the distant hillside chalets and making them appear closer to the viewer.
