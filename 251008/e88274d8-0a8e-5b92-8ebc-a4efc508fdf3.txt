The first frame shows a narrow asphalt street extending into the distance, flanked by buildings. On the left, a person's upper body is partially visible in the foreground, standing near a utility pole. Behind them, multiple buildings line the street, featuring various signs, including some with Japanese text, and cluttered sidewalks with items like bicycles, trash bins, and stacked crates. To the right, a building with a corrugated metal shutter and a large metal pipe running vertically is visible, with yellow plastic bags on its sidewalk. In the background, the street leads into a brightly lit market entrance marked by a sign reading "天満市場," with several people visible inside. Tall, multi-story buildings with light pink and blue facades rise above the street in the distant background.
end of description
The person initially visible on the far left moves out of frame by the second image. Subsequently, a person wearing a beige jacket and carrying a red bag emerges from the distant market entrance and walks towards the viewer, slightly right of the street's center. This person is then followed by another individual in a light blue shirt, also walking from the market towards the viewer. In the final frames, the person in the beige jacket is seen holding a reddish umbrella as they continue to approach the viewer, with the second person still following behind them.
