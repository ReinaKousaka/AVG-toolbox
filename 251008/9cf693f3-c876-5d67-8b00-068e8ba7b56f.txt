The first frame presents an urban street scene with a wide pedestrian crosswalk in the center foreground, marked with white stripes and yellow road markings. To the far right, a dark utility pole and a black railing are visible, while to the left, a sidewalk runs beside a dark building with parked bicycles, leading to pedestrians walking further down the street. Modern multi-story buildings, including one with a white facade and another with blue glass, line the street on both the left and right, receding into the distance under a clear blue sky, with a white van approaching in the mid-distance on the right side of the street.

As the viewpoint advances forward, the utility pole and black railing on the far right of the first frame gradually move out of view to the right. The white pedestrian crosswalk stripes pass beneath the viewer, while a new gray bollard becomes visible near the center of the crosswalk, previously obscured behind the railing. The white van, initially approaching in the mid-distance on the right, moves closer, passes the viewer, and then exits the frame to the right.

A street view captures a crosswalk in the foreground, with a blue arrow sign pointing left and pedestrians on the left sidewalk adjacent to dark buildings. A prominent white high-rise building stands center-left, with a road curving towards the right background where a white van and more structures are visible, flanked by multi-story buildings on both sides.
end of description
The traffic light, positioned above the median center-left, changes from red to green across the frames. Minimal movement includes a few pedestrians on the far left sidewalk subtly shifting, and the distant white van slowly proceeding further down the road away from the viewer.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a wide city street stretches forward, curving slightly to the right, with a prominent zebra crosswalk immediately in front of the viewer. To the immediate right, a white bollard stands next to the crosswalk. On the left, a sidewalk runs alongside a light-colored building, featuring a blue arrow sign pointing right and a red 'P' parking sign, with several leafless trees. A tall white building with blue glass windows dominates the center-left, with a red traffic light visible in front of it. Buildings line both sides of the street, receding into the distance, with pedestrians visible on the sidewalks further away and a white van parked on the far right.

end of description

A pedestrian in a dark coat, initially entering the crosswalk from the right, steadily walks across the street towards the left sidewalk. This individual continues moving away from the viewer along the left sidewalk, eventually appearing further down the street. Other distant pedestrians on the left sidewalk and the right side of the street also show subtle forward movement.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a city street with a prominent modern white building at mid-center and a pedestrian crosswalk spanning the road in the foreground. A woman in a dark coat and face mask is walking across this crosswalk from the right foreground towards the left. To the left, a sidewalk with a low barrier runs alongside buildings where other pedestrians and traffic signs are visible, while more buildings line the street extending into the distance on the right.
end of description
The woman in the puffer jacket continues her walk across the foreground crosswalk from the right, moving further left and gradually out of view. Subsequently, a man in a dark coat and face mask emerges from the left mid-ground. He then steps onto the crosswalk, progressing from the left side, across the viewer's current position, towards the right side of the frame.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a sunny street intersection with a white zebra crossing directly in front of the viewer. A man in a dark coat and white mask is crossing from the left foreground towards the right, with a row of leafless trees and a modern white building along the left sidewalk, and a street extending into the distance on the right where a white utility van is parked.
end of description
The man in the dark coat continues to walk rightward across the zebra crossing and further into the scene. Subsequently, a new person in a lighter coat and mask emerges from the far left to follow across the zebra crossing, while other pedestrians further down the left sidewalk also shift their positions.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a wide-angle street scene in an urban area under a clear blue sky. To the left, a pedestrian in a green jacket walks away from the viewer on a sidewalk lined with bare trees and white bollards, adjacent to a large white building. In the center foreground, another pedestrian in a dark coat walks towards the viewer on the same sidewalk, with more people visible further down. To the right, a street runs parallel to the sidewalk, featuring a white delivery truck and a utility pole with a '40' speed limit sign, bordered by various buildings receding into the distance.
end of description
The pedestrian in the green jacket on the left walks past the first-frame viewpoint and exits the scene to the far left. The person in the dark coat in the middle walks towards the viewer along the sidewalk, pausing to wave their right hand in frame 7. Concurrently, a white delivery truck on the street to the right proceeds further away from the first-frame viewpoint. A cyclist then appears from the far right, moving towards the viewer along the street and passing by the first-frame viewpoint into the right foreground. As the person in green moves, previously obscured grey bollards on the left sidewalk are fully revealed.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a sunny city street scene. A paved sidewalk occupies the foreground and mid-ground, with shadows of bare trees falling across it. To the left, a row of leafless trees with small green bushes at their bases lines a wider sidewalk, behind which stands a modern building with large windows. A man in a dark coat and a white face mask walks towards the viewer, slightly right of the center of the sidewalk. To the right, a street separated by a dark metal fence features a white truck parked or moving slowly away, and a utility pole with a '40' speed limit sign and a 'no parking' sign.

end of description

The viewer moves forward along the sidewalk. The man, initially approaching the first-frame viewpoint, passes to its right and continues walking further down the path, eventually moving past the first-frame viewpoint's immediate area. As the viewer progresses, a new red 'no pedestrian' sign on the utility pole to the right becomes fully visible, having been initially obscured further down the street relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The white truck on the street also continues to recede further away on the right side from the first-frame viewpoint.
