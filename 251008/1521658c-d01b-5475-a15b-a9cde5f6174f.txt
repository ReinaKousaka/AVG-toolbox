In the first frame, a wet city sidewalk at dusk is crowded with numerous pedestrians, including a man in a black shirt and a woman in a white top to the viewer's left, and a man in a green polo centrally, all walking towards the viewer. To the right, a street with moving vehicles and bollards separates them from distant palm trees and the illuminated "Caesars Palace" sign and other buildings under a twilight sky.

Throughout subsequent frames, the pedestrians continuously move forward past the viewer to the left. The initial front individuals like the woman in white and the man in black exit left, while the man in the green polo and the man in the beige vest advance to the foreground before passing, revealing more of the crowd behind them as they too progress towards the viewer's left.
