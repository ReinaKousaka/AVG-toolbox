In the first frame, a wide street with asphalt and white road markings occupies the bottom foreground, with the side of a dark car visible on the far left. Across the midground, a sidewalk features storefronts like "Tiffany & Co." on the right and "Brunello Cucinelli" to the left, separated by a traffic light pole displaying a red light. Potted plants, a green bench, and ornate lampposts with hanging red flowers line the sidewalk, while buildings with various architectural styles, including a brick-faced one and one with awnings, rise into the background, partially obscured by palm trees on the left.
end of description
The camera pans right, revealing more of the street previously to the left of the traffic pole. The dark car on the far left moves out of frame, while the traffic light pole and the Brunello Cucinelli store shift towards the left, exposing more of the street and buildings beyond. Concurrently, the Tiffany & Co. store and the green bench on the right gradually move out of view to the right, and the traffic light changes from red to green.
