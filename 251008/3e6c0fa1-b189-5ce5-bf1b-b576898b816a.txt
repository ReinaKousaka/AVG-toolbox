The first frame shows a wet city street extending into the distance with buildings on both sides, and a person walking away from the viewer down a red brick path, carrying a white bag. A scooter handle is visible in the lower right foreground. end of description. Progressively, the person walks further away as rain becomes evident, and a blue and white umbrella enters the frame from the top, gradually covering the upper view, indicating the viewer is now sheltered. Distant traffic lights change to red, and a "NO TURN ON RED" sign becomes more prominent on the left.

In the first frame, a wet city street extends into the distance under an overcast sky. To the far left, a black pole with a white "NO TURN ON RED" sign is visible. A person in dark clothing and light pants, carrying a white bag, walks away from the viewer on a reddish-brown brick sidewalk located slightly to the right of the frame's center. On the left, a multi-story concrete building adorned with graffiti and string lights lines the street, while another building with red awnings and similar lights occupies the right side, with traffic lights and streetlights further ahead.

end of description

As the frames progress, the camera viewpoint subtly shifts leftward and slightly recedes, revealing more of the street and buildings that were previously just beyond the left edge of the initial view. The person continues walking further into the distance, moving from the central-right area towards the far right of the frame relative to their initial position. A green park bench gradually appears in the lower-left foreground, positioned to the left of where the 'NO TURN ON RED' sign's pole was initially. Subsequently, a light green car emerges on the street in the far left, moving away from the viewer, as the broader context of the urban landscape becomes more visible.

The first frame displays a wet city street on an overcast day. In the foreground, a dark pole with a partially visible street sign is centrally located, with a green metal bench positioned to its lower left. To the left of the viewer, a row of parked cars, including a prominent light green car, rests on a sidewalk, with buildings receding into the distance beyond. To the right, the wet street shows reflective yellow and white lines, leading towards a large concrete building with visible parking levels, graffiti on lower walls, and a tree adorned with string lights.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward and slightly to the left, a red fire hydrant emerges to the lower right of the initial pole's position. The light green car on the left side of the street moves forward, its brake lights illuminating and dimming. More storefronts, including a Starbucks, are progressively revealed further down the sidewalk to the left of where the original parked cars were.

A wet urban street stretches into the hazy distance under an overcast sky. In the foreground, a reflective concrete sidewalk, bordered by a yellow curb and a blue bike rack on the right, leads towards a line of parked cars on the left. A Starbucks storefront and other businesses line the left side of the street, while a darker, multi-story building with green awnings runs along the right, illuminated by a streetlamp and a distant tree with string lights.
end of description
The light-colored car parked on the left side of the street periodically flashes its brake lights on and off. Starting from the sixth frame, a pedestrian emerges from the right side, walking leftward in the midground, on the far side of the street near the multi-story building.

The first frame depicts a wet city street from a sidewalk perspective. In the foreground, a reflective concrete sidewalk stretches forward, with a blue metal barrier partially visible on the far right. To the left, a building features a Starbucks logo above a large display window, while on the right, a wet street holds several parked cars, with a light green Fiat 500 closest to the viewer. Tall buildings line both sides of the street, receding into the overcast distance, and reflections shimmer on the wet surfaces.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, the primary dynamic change observed is the intermittent illumination of brake lights on the parked cars. The light green Fiat 500, positioned to the right of the viewer on the street, repeatedly shows its red brake lights brightening and dimming, as do the brake lights of the red car directly behind it and other vehicles further down the street.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a wet city street on an overcast day, looking down an urban corridor. A concrete sidewalk with storefronts, including a prominent Starbucks sign, lines the left side, while a light green Fiat 500 is parked on the right along a curb, with additional parked cars extending further down the street. Reflections of vehicle taillights and overhead lights shimmer on the slick pavement, leading towards distant buildings.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the most noticeable dynamic change is a dark SUV, parked immediately behind the Fiat, subtly moving forward relative to the first-frame viewpoint, causing its front lighting to become more prominent. Concurrently, other vehicles further down the street also exhibit minor forward shifts, and the reflections on the wet surfaces dynamically change, indicative of ongoing precipitation.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a wet city street and sidewalk extending into the misty distance, with a Starbucks sign prominently positioned on a building to the left and parked cars, including a dark station wagon, lining the right side. Reflections of streetlights and vehicle lights glisten on the wet pavement.

end of description

In subsequent frames, the dark station wagon's brake lights on the right side of the street briefly flicker on and off. A person then emerges from the bottom-left of the first-frame viewpoint, walking across the sidewalk towards the right and eventually exiting the frame. No other significant dynamic changes or newly revealed objects occur relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
