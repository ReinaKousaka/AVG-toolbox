The first frame shows a street scene from a pedestrian's perspective, with green leaves overhanging the top of the view. To the right, a sidewalk is lined with several trees and a series of buildings featuring storefronts with blue awnings. To the left of the sidewalk, a street extends into the distance, occupied by a white car in motion on the left and a line of parked vehicles, including a prominent grey sedan, alongside the sidewalk. A white and red barrier post is visible on the bottom-left of the sidewalk.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the white and red barrier post on the bottom-left recedes out of view. The grey parked car and other vehicles on the street shift towards the left, revealing more of the sidewalk and storefronts further ahead on the right. The white car on the street moves further into the distance relative to the viewer's forward motion. Simultaneously, the overhanging foliage shifts, with some leaves moving out of the top of the frame and new, closer leaves entering from above.

The first frame depicts a sidewalk extending forward on the right, bordered by buildings with blue awnings and large storefront windows. A young tree with vibrant green foliage stands on the sidewalk directly in front of the viewer. To the left, a street runs parallel, featuring a grey sedan parked closest, followed by a line of other vehicles and more buildings in the distance, all under an overcast sky.

Upon examining the subsequent frames, no dynamic changes or newly revealed objects or scenes are observed. All visible elements and their spatial positions remain static and identical across the entire sequence.

The first frame captures a street scene looking down a sidewalk on the right and a road on the left, under an overcast sky. A lush green tree stands on the sidewalk in the mid-foreground, slightly right of center. To the left, a grey parked car is visible on the street, with a line of other vehicles extending into the distance. On the right, a row of commercial buildings with storefronts and blue awnings stretches along the sidewalk, and a yellow diamond-shaped road sign is seen further down the street behind the central tree.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's position subtly advances forward along the sidewalk. The central tree gradually moves to the left side of the frame, passing by the viewer's initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the grey parked car on the street and the storefronts on the right appear to recede, moving further left relative to the original viewpoint, with interior details of the shops becoming slightly clearer. The yellow road sign also moves further left as the perspective shifts forward.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a street scene from a pedestrian's perspective on a sidewalk. A tree with green leaves is prominent in the left-center foreground, partially obscuring the sidewalk to its left where a gray sedan is parked. To the right of the tree, a paved sidewalk extends alongside a row of commercial storefronts with large display windows and dark blue awnings. Further down the street on the left, more parked vehicles line the curb, while light poles with blue banners and a green utility box are visible in the midground.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint advances forward along the sidewalk. The initial foreground tree shifts left and partially out of frame, along with the gray sedan. A yellow sign becomes more visible to the left of the tree, and a hanging basket with pink flowers, previously in the midground, grows larger as it moves closer, attached to a light pole. The storefronts on the right reveal clearer details, including signs for "Locks" and "Use North Door to Enter" with an arrow, as the perspective moves past them.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows the viewer on a city sidewalk looking down a street. To the immediate left, a tree trunk partially obscures a row of parked cars, including a grey sedan and a silver SUV. In the mid-ground, a lamppost with a hanging flower basket and a blue banner stands before a green advertising board, while storefronts with blue awnings and large windows displaying "Locks" line the right side of the path.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, a yellow road sign on the far left, a white "Now Open" sign next to the lamppost, and a prominent "Harry's" sign with security service details above the right-side storefront are gradually revealed and brought closer. The building on the right also exposes the address "2213" as the perspective shifts along the sidewalk.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a lamppost with a hanging basket of purple flowers hangs in the upper-left, extending downwards to the center. To the lamppost's left, the rear section of a dark gray car is visible, followed by a beige SUV and a line of parked cars extending down the street. On the right, a sidewalk leads past several storefronts, with "Harry's Locksmith" under a blue awning, displaying the number "2213" on its facade, closest to the viewer. Further along the sidewalk, a small tree, a white "NOW OPEN" sign, and a green trash receptacle are visible.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the dark gray car on the far left of the initial frame gradually moves out of view to the left. The beige SUV and subsequent parked cars, which were initially ahead, become more prominent and closer to the viewer. Simultaneously, the lamppost recedes to the far left as the viewpoint passes it, while the "Harry's Locksmith" store and the "NOW OPEN" sign on the right approach and become more central, revealing more detail of their storefronts.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a dark vertical pole occupies the far left foreground. To its right, a light-colored SUV is parked on the street, followed by several other vehicles further down the street. A small leafy tree stands on the sidewalk directly in front of the viewer, with an 'NOW OPEN' A-frame sign and a tall, dark waste bin further down the sidewalk in the center. To the right, a storefront with a blue awning and large display windows, labeled "HARRY'S," is visible.

end of description

The viewer moves forward along the sidewalk, causing the initial dark pole to move out of view to the far left. The parked cars and the tree on the left, along with the "NOW OPEN" sign and waste bin, progressively recede further behind and to the left of the initial first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the storefront on the right, including "Harry's," moves further to the right and slightly behind the viewer. A neon sign within "Harry's" storefront, initially visible to the right, becomes more illuminated and active with changing patterns as the viewer passes it.
