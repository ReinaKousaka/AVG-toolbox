In the first frame, a large white tarp covers the entire left side of the view, revealing only a narrow gap to the left of it where a blurry person is visible. To the right of the tarp, an older male vendor with white hair, wearing a green apron, stands behind a market stall counter, holding a small dark bottle. A male customer in a dark puffer jacket and a light beanie stands with his back mostly to the viewer, facing the vendor, holding colorful shopping bags in his left hand. Behind the vendor, shelves with various bottles and products are visible, and in the far background to the right of the customer, several blurry people are present.

The camera slowly pans right, progressively revealing more of the market stall's interior to the left, including additional shelves filled with products. A second vendor, a woman with dark hair, emerges from behind the counter to the left of the first vendor. The first vendor continues to engage with the customer, gesturing with the bottle, while the customer slightly adjusts his stance. Simultaneously, the background to the far right becomes more visible, showing additional market stalls and people further down the aisle.
