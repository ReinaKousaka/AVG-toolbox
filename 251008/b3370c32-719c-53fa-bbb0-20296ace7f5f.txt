In the first frame, a low-angle view shows a textured platform with yellow and blue railing in the immediate foreground, bearing "2016 Rio de Janeiro" text. To the left and right, green and silver railings extend forward from the viewer, partially obscuring the path. Two grey posts stand on the platform directly in front, with another pair further down. In the midground, two people are visible on the path: one in a lime green top carrying a blue bag, and another largely obscured by the right railing. Buildings line both sides, with a large tree between them in the center, and a tall building with green windows dominates the background on the right.

The camera smoothly moves forward along the path, revealing more of the platform and the buildings to the left and right. The initial foreground railings and text gradually exit the frame as the two people in the midground become clearer and appear closer to the viewer. The person initially on the far right moves out of view.

The first frame shows a pedestrian pathway with grey bollards and green railings. A person in a lime-green shirt and white-and-dark-blue jacket stands on the right, facing a downward-sloping street visible between buildings, including one with graffiti on the left and tall structures in the distant background. end of description. Subsequently, the person fully dons their jacket, then extends their right arm to the left before retrieving a pink bag, previously out of view, and placing it on their left shoulder as they look down the street.
