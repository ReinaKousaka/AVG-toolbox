The first frame depicts a rain-drenched city street at night, with a wet asphalt road leading towards illuminated buildings and trees in the background. On the right, a tree trunk and a black bin are positioned on a sidewalk; across the street, a silver SUV is parked on the left, a white van in the center, and a white car with bright red taillights is visible on the far right, moving away.

Over the subsequent frames, the white car on the far right moves further away from the viewer and eventually exits the frame towards the right background. Concurrently, the camera performs a slow, subtle pan to the right, causing the left side of the street scene to gradually move out of view and revealing more of the tree trunk on the immediate right. Heavy rain visibly continues throughout the entire sequence, falling consistently across the scene.

The first frame shows a rainy night street with a dark trash bin and a thick vertical pole in the immediate foreground, bottom center/right. A wet asphalt road with white lane markings spans the midground, featuring a silver SUV parked on the far left and a white minivan parked on the right, partially obscured by the pole. Along the sidewalk behind the road, several motorcycles, bicycles, buildings with illuminated storefronts, and green trees are visible, all under a downpour creating reflections on the wet ground.

Heavy rain continues throughout the frames. A white car with illuminated red taillights newly appears from the far right of the road in the fourth frame, then gradually moves towards the viewer's left. As the car progresses across the road, a white sign with red text on a pole and a blue object on the ground below it become more clearly visible on the far right, beyond the initial pole.

In the first frame, a wet, rain-slicked city street is visible at night, illuminated by streetlights and storefronts. On the right, a vertical light pole stands in the foreground, with a blue object and a dark rectangular item at its base on the sidewalk. A silver sedan with illuminated red taillights is positioned mid-road on the right, while a white SUV is parked further left along the curb. On the left sidewalk, several scooters and bicycles are parked in front of buildings with glowing signs; trees are interspersed along the sidewalk. The background reveals more distant city lights and structures obscured by rain.
end of description
The silver sedan on the right side of the road slowly moves forward, gradually turning left to cross the intersection, revealing more of its side profile. Concurrently, a tree trunk situated just behind the initial pole on the far right progressively becomes more visible, appearing to move inward from the right frame edge. The heavy rain continues to fall consistently throughout the sequence.
