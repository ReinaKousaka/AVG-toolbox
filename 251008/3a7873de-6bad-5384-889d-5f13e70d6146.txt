The first frame presents a rusted antique pickup truck filled with various green plants and colorful flowers, centrally located on a gravel patch. To its immediate right in the foreground, a vibrant bush with purple flowers is prominent, while in the midground, two rustic log cabins with grass roofs stand to the right, beyond which a paved road and another building are visible in the background, all surrounded by tall trees.

Beginning around the seventh frame, a slender brown pole progressively rises vertically from behind the front portion of the rusted car, on its driver's side, becoming fully extended in subsequent frames.
