The first frame shows a park scene with a winding dirt path leading from the foreground into the mid-ground. To the left, a grassy area holds several small trees with white-painted trunks and a large tree bursting with yellow and orange autumn leaves, while a white wall with ornate dark windows runs along the right side of the path, backed by more trees and a partial view of a brown wooden bench in the lower right.

A person then emerges from further down the path in the mid-ground, walking towards the viewer. They continue to move closer along the path in subsequent frames, maintaining their position relative to the initial viewpoint.

The first frame displays an autumn park scene with a dirt path winding from the bottom center into the mid-ground, flanked by fallen leaves. To the left, a grassy area contains several trees, including a large one in the far foreground, all with white-painted lower trunks. To the right, numerous smaller trees with white bases line the path, leading to a long white wall with decorative windows in the mid-background. A canopy of trees with vibrant yellow and orange foliage arches overhead, and a small, dark figure is faintly visible walking on the path in the mid-background.
end of description
The camera moves forward along the path, causing the large tree on the left of the initial viewpoint to shift further left and eventually out of view. Simultaneously, the white wall and trees on the right of the original viewpoint move closer and then begin to recede rightwards. The path continuously unfolds in front of the viewer, revealing new sections of trees and foliage beyond the initial frame. The figure originally in the mid-background progressively moves closer and eventually passes the original viewpoint, continuing deeper into the scene.
