frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a train track, composed of two rails and gravel ballast, stretching centrally from the immediate foreground into the distance where it curves slightly right. To the left, a grassy embankment leads to small trees, a wooden fence, a road, and distant snow-capped mountains; to the right, a similar embankment borders a dense forest of various trees and a dark utility pole featuring a small yellow, partially obscured sign. A large forested mountain dominates the central background beneath an overcast sky, with a thin wire descending from the top center.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the tracks, the gravel ballast and rails progress underneath. The utility pole on the right side approaches, clearly revealing a yellow sign marked "144 5" before passing out of view to the viewer's right. Simultaneously, a clearing with a road and several parked vehicles, including a white van, becomes visible to the left of the tracks as the scene unfolds.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame presents a view from a train moving forward along railroad tracks that curve gently to the right, bordered by an embankment on the right and a parallel road with parked vehicles and sparse trees on the left. In the background, forested mountains dominate the view, with distant snowy peaks on the far left, all under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses along the tracks, the roadside on the left, including parked vehicles and a fence, moves from ahead to the viewer's left and eventually behind. A wooden pole also appears and passes on the left, followed by a large utility pole with overhead lines emerging from the right midground, passing by, and receding to the viewer's right. The continuous forward motion reveals more of the winding tracks and the receding valley scenery.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays train tracks extending forward and curving right into the distance. To the immediate left of the viewer, a wooden post stands beside a grassy slope and a fence, which leads further back to tall conifer trees and a parking area containing a white car and buildings. On the immediate right, a narrow concrete structure borders a grassy incline with lighter green deciduous trees and a dense conifer forest, all set against distant mountains under a cloudy sky, with a thin wire overhead.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward along the tracks. Objects on the left, such as the fence, parking area, and buildings, gradually recede, moving from the left side of the first-frame viewpoint to eventually passing behind it. Concurrently, a dark signal pole with a blue light, initially out of frame further down the track, appears on the right side of the tracks, approaching the original viewpoint's position.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a train's forward view along a gravel track that gently curves to the right into the distance, bordered by green foliage. To the left, a building with a dark roof and lighter walls is nestled among trees, with distant mountains visible beyond. On the right, a steep, forested hillside with tall evergreen trees rises, featuring a signal pole with a black box and yellow circular sign in the mid-ground. Overcast skies are overhead, and catenary wires are visible across the top.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the signal pole on the right quickly passes out of view. The building on the left gradually recedes into the background. The landscape continuously shifts, revealing more of the forested hillsides on both sides and extending the view along the curving tracks. A blue pole briefly appears on the far left, while the distant mountains and trees remain a constant backdrop as the train traverses the winding route.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a view looking down parallel train tracks extending forward, curving slightly right into a forested valley. Green bushes and trees line both sides of the tracks, with distant mountains under a cloudy sky, a utility pole with overhead wires to the mid-right, and 'Vmax: 95km/h' at the bottom left.
end of description.
As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward along the tracks; the utility pole on the right approaches and passes behind the viewer, while a cluster of white vehicles and a blue structure progressively emerge and become more distinct to the left of the tracks, replacing the initial obscured left-side foliage.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a train track stretching directly away from the viewer, curving slightly to the right in the distance, with gravel ballast between and around the rails. To the left, green shrubs and trees line the track, behind which a small blue building with a white roof is partially visible. On the right, more green foliage borders the track, and a utility pole with overhead wires rises into the frame from the lower right, extending towards the top center. In the background, a tree-covered mountain looms under an overcast sky, with some light reflections visible on the viewing pane.
end of description
As the perspective advances along the tracks, the immediate foreground continuously refreshes. The blue building and structures on the far left recede and eventually move out of the frame. Simultaneously, the utility pole on the right approaches, passes the viewer's position, and then diminishes into the background on the right. Further down the tracks on the right, a yellow signal marker becomes visible as the train progresses into the curve. The dense forest on both sides and the distant mountain remain, appearing closer and shifting perspective with the forward motion.
