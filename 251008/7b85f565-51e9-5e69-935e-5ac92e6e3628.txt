The first frame captures a street scene with a sidewalk on the right foreground, featuring two gray-and-yellow bollards and a modern building wall with a glass canopy. Two trees with green foliage stand prominently to the left and center-left, bordering a wet asphalt road where several pedestrians are visible on the far side and a group moves away on the immediate sidewalk.

In subsequent frames, the people on the right-side sidewalk, including a woman in a black top and shorts, continue walking away from the viewer, moving further into the midground. Simultaneously, pedestrians on the far side of the road (left-midground) continue their movements, crossing and walking along the sidewalk, shifting their positions relative to the static first-frame elements.

In the first frame, a tree with a green canopy and a dark trunk stands slightly left of center, separating a wet asphalt road on its left from a gray and yellow paved sidewalk on its right, which features several bollards. To the left, across the street, people walk near modern glass buildings, while on the right sidewalk, a group of pedestrians stands further away, with a grassy area and more urban structures beyond them.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward/right. The pedestrians on the far left continue walking across the intersection, and the woman in shorts on the right sidewalk walks further down the path, moving away from the viewer past the stationary group.

The first frame depicts an urban street scene with a large tree trunk and foliage dominating the left foreground, a paved sidewalk with bollards and grass on the right, and a road with pedestrians and modern buildings extending into the midground and background. end of description. The view slowly pans right, revealing a wider street and a prominent modern building with a glass-enclosed elevated walkway previously obscured on the left of the original view. Concurrently, the three pedestrians on the right sidewalk continue walking left, moving deeper into the scene, while a white car and additional pedestrians emerge on the far left portion of the road.

The first frame depicts an urban street scene with a paved road on the left, marked with white crosswalk lines and arrows, and a sidewalk on the right featuring yellow tactile paving. In the immediate foreground, two men in white shirts and dark pants are walking towards the viewer on the right sidewalk, positioned to the right of a central green tree. Further back on the left, a white van is parked, and several pedestrians are visible on the crosswalk and distant sidewalks, with two women walking on the left side of the road towards the viewer. Modern buildings with glass and gray facades rise on both sides of the street, extending into the background under an overcast sky.
end of description
Across the following frames, the two men on the right sidewalk continue walking towards the viewer, progressing further into the foreground and becoming more prominent. Simultaneously, the two women on the left side of the road also move closer towards the viewer from the midground. In the later frames, a motorcycle with a rider is newly revealed in the far left background, moving horizontally from left to right behind the stationary white van.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the foreground, two men holding coffee cups walk towards the viewer on the right sidewalk, while two women walk away on the street to the left. A wide street with a crosswalk and trees extends into the background, flanked by modern glass and stone buildings, including an elevated walkway on the far left.
end of description
The two men in the foreground walk past the viewer and exit the frame to the right. Concurrently, the two women on the left continue walking further into the scene, crossing the street as a white car and a moped move from left to right in the midground. More pedestrians appear and move deeper into the background on the far sidewalk.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts an urban street scene with a paved sidewalk on the right and a road on the left, both leading into the distance. In the foreground, two women walk left on the road, with a white van slightly behind them, while a tree stands on the central median and a person walks away on the right sidewalk. Modern buildings line both sides of the street in the background.
end of description
The two women in the foreground-left walk out of view to the left as the video progresses, while the white van on the road proceeds forward, moving from left to right relative to the viewer. A person on a red scooter then appears behind the van on the road, also moving forward. The pedestrian on the right sidewalk continues walking further into the distance, and more people appear crossing the street further ahead, from left to right.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a city street featuring a paved sidewalk with tactile paving and a grassy strip on the right, and a road with a pedestrian crossing and directional arrows on the left. Two trees stand centrally on the sidewalk, with a blue pedestrian sign attached to one, while a person on a scooter, a standing figure, and a white van are near the crossing. A person with a backpack walks away on the right sidewalk, amidst modern glass buildings lining both sides of the street.
end of description
Subsequently, the person on the scooter moves leftward across the pedestrian crossing and further down the street, while the white van slowly proceeds across the crossing from left-center. Simultaneously, the person on the right sidewalk continues walking away from the viewer, deeper into the scene, with other distant pedestrians also traversing the street.
