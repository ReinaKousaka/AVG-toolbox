In the first frame, a wet, dark street recedes into the distance, reflecting light from two bright street lamps. To the immediate right, a concrete wall with a yellow roll-up door is visible, next to an orange cone. Further right, a well-lit evergreen tree stands before a modern building, with a yellow barrier and signs below it. On the left, the street is bordered by a dark, indistinct structure, and a white car is parked further down.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the street, causing the yellow door on the immediate right to exit the frame. Simultaneously, a traditional Korean-style building with a brown fence and a balcony is revealed and becomes increasingly prominent on the left side of the street, while the evergreen tree and modern building on the right shift further right and backward relative to the advancing viewpoint. The street ahead becomes longer and more centered, revealing additional distant streetlights and utility poles.
