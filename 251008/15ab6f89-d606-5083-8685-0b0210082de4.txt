The first frame presents a street scene with a white sedan prominent in the foreground left, alongside a row of parked cars on both sides. To the left, old residential buildings with storefronts line the street, while modern glass-facade buildings rise on the right, all under an overcast sky. Further down the road, pedestrians and vehicles move towards the viewer, with distant hills and buildings visible in the background. end of description. As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the street, causing the initial foreground cars to recede from the first-frame viewpoint, while continuously revealing more of the road ahead with its ongoing traffic and pedestrians. The speedometer in the bottom right decreases from 7 to 5 km/h, and a "WALK CHINA" watermark emerges in the bottom left corner in later frames, indicating continued forward movement.

The first frame presents an urban street scene looking down a road lined with buildings. On the left, older residential buildings with balconies stand beside parked cars, including a partial dark blue sedan and a white sedan. On the right, modern buildings with glass facades are visible, alongside multiple parked white and silver cars. A silver sedan is centrally positioned further down the road, facing away from the viewer, while pedestrians and small market stalls with umbrellas populate both sidewalks. In the distant background, a tree-covered hill is topped by a white building.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the street. The silver sedan, initially ahead in the road, approaches and passes the viewer, eventually receding behind the original viewpoint. The parked cars on both sides gradually shift from the foreground, moving past the viewer's original position to appear behind them. Pedestrians on the sidewalks also move, some walking towards and others away from the viewer, while the buildings and street details further down the road become increasingly prominent and closer. The recorded speed also fluctuates from 5 km/h down to 3 km/h and then back to 4 km/h.

The first frame depicts a narrow street extending away from the viewer, flanked by parked cars and buildings under an overcast sky. In the foreground, a white sedan and a silver SUV are on the left, while a gray sedan and a white SUV are on the right. Pedestrians walk along the central road, which leads towards a mix of older buildings with green construction hoarding on the left, and modern structures with glass facades on the right, with a white domed structure visible on a distant hilltop in the background.

end of description

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. A pedestrian wearing a white apron walks towards the viewer from the left midground, becoming closer, while a group of pedestrians in the central midground, including one with a suitcase, recedes further into the distance.

The first frame captures a city street bordered by multi-story buildings under an overcast sky. On the immediate left, a person in an apron stands beside a partially visible white car and a pink motorized tricycle, while a green construction barrier extends further down the left side. On the right, several cars are parked, including a white SUV and a black sedan, with storefronts visible along the building. Numerous pedestrians traverse the road towards distant buildings and hills.
end of description.
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward. The person on the left moves ahead, the pink tricycle becomes more fully visible, and two bright green stools are revealed near the construction barrier. Simultaneously, the parked cars on the right shift position, and the speedometer in the bottom right corner updates from 0 km/h to 8-9 km/h, reflecting the forward motion.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a street view under an overcast sky, featuring two yellow-green stools in the foreground left and a green construction fence running along the left. A white SUV is parked mid-left, while a dark SUV and a white scooter are parked on the right, ahead of which a group of people walk away from the viewer. Tall apartment buildings rise on the left, with a modern glass-facade building on the right and other structures receding into the background. Overlays display a map, speed, and coordinates.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the yellow-green stools disappear from the foreground, and the green fence with the white SUV shift left and partially out of frame, revealing more of the street ahead. The walking people and parked vehicles on the right recede further from the initial viewpoint as the coordinates update, indicating continuous forward progression.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a street scene with a prominent green construction fence on the left, displaying red warning signs, and a white SUV parked along the curb further ahead on the left. To the right, various motorcycles, scooters, and a small utility vehicle are parked alongside a building with a glass facade, while two men, one pulling a black suitcase, walk away from the viewer in the road's center. Tall residential buildings dominate the background on the left, with multi-story commercial buildings on the right, and a distant structure is visible on a hilltop straight ahead.

end of description

As the sequence progresses, the viewer moves forward, causing the green construction fence on the left to recede backward relative to the initial viewpoint, revealing more of the parked white SUV and the street beyond. Concurrently, the two men walking ahead move further away, appearing smaller, and the parked vehicles on the right also recede backward from their original positions. The speed overlay in the bottom right corner increases from 9 to 11 km/h, indicating continuous forward motion.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a street scene with a white SUV partially obscuring the lower left, parked next to a long green construction fence with red signs. Behind the fence, a tall building rises, while a white sedan is parked further along the left curb. On the right, a row of scooters and small electric vehicles lines the curb, backed by commercial buildings with glass facades. Several pedestrians, including a man pulling a black suitcase, walk away from the viewer in the midground, with more buildings and distant hills in the background under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the white SUV on the left to recede and revealing more of the white sedan behind it, which then appears closer to the viewer's immediate left. The pedestrians continue walking further away, and the entire street scene scrolls past the viewer, with the reported speed increasing from 11 to 12 km/h.
