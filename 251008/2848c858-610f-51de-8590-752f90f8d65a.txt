A light blue van is parked on the left side of a cobblestone path, facing away from the viewer. To the right, a white and dark brown timber-framed building features a window with open light pink shutters and a box of purple flowers. Further along the path on the right is a light blue-grey house with a brown door and flower boxes. On the far left, another timber-framed building is partially visible, and further back, another building with green shutters is seen. A manhole cover is present on the path in the foreground.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the cobblestone path. As the camera advances, the light blue van on the left gradually moves out of frame to the viewer's left and slightly behind. The timber-framed buildings to the right and left, including their windows, shutters, and flower boxes, progressively appear closer and more detailed, indicating movement deeper into the alley.
