The first frame shows a street scene from a forward-facing viewpoint. In the immediate foreground, the wet asphalt street stretches away, flanked by buildings. To the viewer's left, a wide sidewalk features two pedestrians walking away from the viewer, alongside a large white building with ornate details and several empty window openings. A utility pole stands mid-left. To the viewer's right, a green and blue auto-rickshaw with a driver is positioned towards the right side of the street, while a black auto-rickshaw moves centrally down the street away from the viewer. Further down the street, a red car also moves away, with multiple white and light-colored buildings lining both sides of the road under a clear blue sky crisscrossed by utility wires.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the two pedestrians on the left sidewalk walk further away from the viewer, eventually exiting the frame to the left. The black auto-rickshaw in the center and the red car behind it continue to drive further down the street, receding into the distance. Concurrently, the green and blue auto-rickshaw on the right also moves away from the viewer, gradually exiting the frame to the right. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the dynamic changes consist solely of these vehicles and pedestrians moving away from the first-frame viewpoint.

A young man with a backpack stands on the left foreground next to a trash can and a white building, looking right, while a dark vehicle drives away from the viewer down a wet street lined with buildings under a blue sky.
end of description
The man walks right and further away along the left sidewalk, eventually passing the trash can and revealing more of the white building behind him. Simultaneously, the dark vehicle recedes down the street, and a green street sign in the mid-distance becomes clearer as a woman appears on the far right sidewalk, walking towards the viewer.

The first frame displays a street scene with a clear sky overhead. On the left, a sidewalk runs alongside a row of buildings painted in white and light blue, where a person with a bag stands near the foreground. Further down the left sidewalk, more pedestrians are visible. On the right, another sidewalk lines a row of older buildings, some with a distinct blue lower section, and a person in a blue top is visible. In the middle of the street, a dark three-wheeled vehicle and a motorcycle are driving away from the viewer. Overhead, utility poles and wires crisscross, with a green and white sign hanging slightly to the left of the street's center.
end of description
The viewer moves forward down the street, causing the person initially on the far left sidewalk to depart the scene towards the left-rear relative to the first frame's perspective. The three-wheeled vehicle and motorcycle in the street continue moving away, appearing progressively further down the street relative to the first frame's position. A different motorcycle, initially unseen or very distant from the first frame's viewpoint, becomes visible on the left sidewalk, moving closer and eventually passing the original camera position. Concurrently, new pedestrians appear on the left sidewalk, drawing closer and walking past the original camera's location. Buildings on both sides of the street continuously unfold, revealing more details and a further stretch of the road from the original vantage point.
