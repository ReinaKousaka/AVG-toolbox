The first frame presents a lush green grassy foreground with a small round bush at its center-left, leading to an ascending green slope. To the left, a multi-storied dark wooden building with white trim and yellow-shuttered windows occupies a significant portion, while a fragment of another dark building with white appears on the far right. In the midground, beyond the slope, several wooden houses, including a prominent orange one, are visible against a backdrop of forested mountains and a cloudy sky.

Subsequent frames show a subtle rightward panning motion, causing elements to shift slightly left relative to the initial viewpoint. The left dark wooden building slowly recedes further left, revealing a narrow dark structure previously obscured between it and the distant orange house. Concurrently, the small bush and other midground elements gradually shift left, while the partial dark building on the far right subtly expands its visible area from the right edge.
