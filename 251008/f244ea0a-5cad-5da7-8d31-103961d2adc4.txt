The first frame presents a dirt path curving gently from the lower center towards the mid-left, bordered by a steep earthen bank with exposed tree roots and tall grass on the viewer's immediate left. To the path's right, the ground slopes down to a calm body of water reflecting the sky, flanked by numerous tall trees with varying foliage that extend into the midground and background under a bright sky.
end of description
The viewpoint continuously moves forward along the dirt path. As the camera advances, the earthen bank and roots initially on the viewer's left foreground recede towards the midground and then exit the frame behind the viewer. Simultaneously, the large trees and the body of water on the right also recede, revealing new segments of the winding path and dense forest ahead of the viewer.
