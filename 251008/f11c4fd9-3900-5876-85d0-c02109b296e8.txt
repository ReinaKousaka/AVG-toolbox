In the first frame, a train station platform with tracks extends from the foreground-left towards the midground. To the left of the tracks is a wooden station building, with overhead catenary wires spanning above. On the right, a stone wall borders the platform, topped by a large green-leafed tree that partially covers the upper-right corner, revealing red and brown buildings behind it. In the distance, towering mountains dominate the background under a clear blue sky.

Subsequently, the person walking away from the viewer on the train platform moves further into the midground. The camera slightly pans right and subtly zooms out, expanding the view of the mountain range and revealing more of the station area to the left. The tree's leaves on the right also show slight movement, while the overall mountainous backdrop and station structure remain consistent.
