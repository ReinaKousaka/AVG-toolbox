In the first frame, a wet, rainy street scene is viewed from a sidewalk perspective at night. A white and black scooter is positioned in the lower left foreground, with a wet sidewalk extending right. Several tree trunks and lampposts stand vertically along the sidewalk, behind which a grey SUV is parked diagonally on the wet road, its rear facing the viewer. Further right, a dark SUV is parked behind another tree, also facing away, with a red fire hydrant visible on the sidewalk between the two vehicles. Across the multi-lane road, multiple cars are parked or driving, and buildings with illuminated signs line the background, obscured by heavy rain.

From the second frame, the top portion of the scene is increasingly covered by the dark underside of an umbrella, suggesting the viewer is now sheltered. The heavy rain persists throughout, intensifying slightly. The grey SUV in the midground slowly moves forward and left, its brake lights changing to green, while the dark SUV to its right also slowly advances, with its red tail lights illuminating. A yellow car emerges from behind the moving grey SUV and drives further into the background.
