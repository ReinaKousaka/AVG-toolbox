The first frame features a bald man in a black turtleneck and velvet jacket standing slightly right of center, addressing the viewer, with his left hand resting on a dark wooden console table. On the table, to the man's left, is a large potted plant in a decorative blue pot, alongside a lit candle and a small figurine; behind him is a hallway with light-colored walls, two framed pictures, and an open doorway leading to a brighter room, all under a hanging chandelier.

As the camera slowly pulls back, the man gestures dynamically while stepping slightly forward and to the left. An arched doorway on the viewer's right is more fully revealed, and a white kitchen countertop with a sink and a bowl of fruit becomes visible to the viewer's left, exposing more of the adjacent room.
