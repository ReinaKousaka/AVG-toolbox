The first frame displays a man in a purple shirt and black pants standing centrally, facing the viewer, with a dark kitchen island occupying the foreground on his left. To his right, a large grid-paned window reveals an outdoor stone pillar and lush greenery. In the background left, an archway leads to another room where a sofa and a vertical window are visible, while another window is further back to the center-right. The visible floor is light wood.

The man walks backward and slightly to the right, revealing more of the room to the right of the first-frame viewpoint. As he retreats, a second large, grid-paned window becomes fully visible to the right of the initial window, showing an outdoor swimming pool and additional stone pillars beyond. Simultaneously, a modern chandelier descends from the ceiling into the frame, positioned above the newly revealed window area and slightly to the right of the man's original position.
