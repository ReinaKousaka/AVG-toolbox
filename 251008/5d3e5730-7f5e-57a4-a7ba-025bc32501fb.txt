The first frame shows a paved road extending from the immediate foreground towards distant green mountains under a bright blue sky with white clouds. To the viewer's left is a gently rising, grass-covered mountainside, while to the right, a steeper, rockier, grass-covered slope rises prominently.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the mountainsides flanking the path to shift and recede. A tall, slender white and orange-red striped pole emerges from the right mountainside, becoming increasingly prominent and closer to the viewer as it passes to the right of the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a paved road leading into the distance, bordered by a green grassy slope to the left and a rocky hillside to the right where a red and white striped pole stands, with distant mountains and a blue, cloudy sky in the background.
end of description
As the viewer progresses, the road, left slope, and right hillside continuously move closer and pass by. The red and white pole on the right recedes from the midground, eventually disappearing to the right, while a new grey post emerges further ahead on the right and gradually approaches the viewer.

The first frame displays an asphalt road extending centrally into the distance, flanked by mountainous terrain. To the viewer's left, a large, lush green mountain slope rises, while to the right, a rocky, partially vegetated slope ascends. The background consists of further green mountains under a clear blue sky dotted with scattered white clouds.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. A prominent red and white striped pole is revealed further ahead on the right side of the road from the initial viewpoint, becoming larger as it approaches the viewer's immediate right. It then gradually moves out of frame to the viewer's right and slightly behind the original viewpoint. The road ahead and the surrounding mountain slopes continuously recede into the distance, revealing more of the path forward from the initial viewpoint.
