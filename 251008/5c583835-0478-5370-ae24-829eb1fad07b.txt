In the foreground, a person holding a skateboard walks towards the viewer in the center, while a person with dark hair is partially visible on the bottom right, and another person walks away from the viewer on the left. In the mid-ground, several individuals populate the sidewalk, and a street with parked cars runs parallel on the left, while a building with decorative panels and a bench is to the right. The background features more illuminated buildings and streetlights under a dark sky.

Chronologically, the person holding the skateboard moves past the viewer's right, eventually exiting the frame, as does the person initially partially visible in the bottom right. Subsequently, a woman in a black jacket and striped skirt emerges from the mid-right, walking towards the viewer. A person in a black hoodie and purple pants also enters from the mid-center, moving towards the viewer. Finally, a silver bicycle becomes visible on the sidewalk to the left, adjacent to the person walking away from the viewer, as other background figures continue their movement.

A person in a black jacket and dark shorts walks away from the viewer in the center-left midground, while a silver bicycle is parked to their left on the sidewalk. The background features a nighttime city street with illuminated buildings, distant vehicles, and a vertical digital display on the left, contrasting with a concrete-textured building facade adorned with decorative geometric panels and a red sign on the right, where several other pedestrians are visible further down the sidewalk.
end of description
The person with light hair and the individual behind them move towards the right, exiting the frame, which reveals more of a decorative panel on the right building. Concurrently, a person in a grey hoodie and dark cap enters the frame from the right, moving left across the midground towards the viewer. As this person moves left and eventually exits, a wooden bench with illuminated trim is gradually revealed in the right midground. A person is then seen sitting on this bench, having been previously obscured. The person walking away in the center-left continues to move further into the distance, almost exiting the frame by the end.

The first frame shows a person walking away from the viewer in the foreground-left on a city sidewalk at night, with multiple pedestrians further down the street, and a group conversing midground-center-right beside a building, where another person sits on a bench on the far right.
end of description
The foreground person continues walking further away. Simultaneously, pedestrians on the left sidewalk progress forward, and a cyclist emerges from the far-left, moving right across the street in the midground, away from the viewer. Subsequently, a scooter also appears from the far-left, moving away from the viewer, while the group on the right shifts positions slightly.

The first frame depicts a nighttime street with a person in a dark hoodie walking away from the viewer on the left, beside a bright digital advertisement screen. To the right, a group of people stands near a building facade with a rolled-down shutter, one person adjusting another's beanie, and a fourth person seated on a bench further right. end of description. As subsequent frames progress, the person on the far left walks entirely out of frame.

In the first frame, a man in a black hoodie and shorts walks away from the viewer on a sidewalk, adjacent to a green recycling bin on the far left and a closed grey-shuttered storefront on the right. Ahead, other pedestrians and a person on a pink and white scooter are visible near a crosswalk, with city buildings, scaffolding, and street signs like 'ONE WAY' forming the background under a night sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint subtly moves forward, the man in the black hoodie advances, eventually passing the recycling bin which reveals more of its 'Keep it clean' message on its side, while the right storefront recedes from view. The distant pedestrians and the scooter also exhibit minor forward progression.

First, the frame depicts a nighttime city street with a green public bin in the foreground left and a closed metallic roller shutter prominently on the right. A person in a dark hoodie and shorts walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk towards a crosswalk, where a scooter and several pedestrians are visible beyond, with a scaffolding-covered building and distant city lights in the background. end of description. In subsequent frames, the person in the hoodie continues walking away from the viewer towards and across the crosswalk in the center-right. Simultaneously, the scooter, initially positioned to the left of the crosswalk from the first-frame viewpoint, moves further left and exits the scene, while the background pedestrians also proceed further away from the viewer.

The first frame displays a nighttime city street scene. A person in a dark jacket and shorts walks away from the viewer, positioned centrally over a white-striped crosswalk. To the lower right, a large white planter containing a small tree stands next to a dark pole, with a black car parked behind it on the street. On the left, several pedestrians walk further down a sidewalk lined with parked cars and buildings featuring illuminated windows; scaffolding covers a building on the right side of the midground.
end of description
The person in the foreground continues walking forward across the crosswalk, moving further away from the viewer. A second person, initially appearing behind and slightly to the left of the first person relative to the first-frame viewpoint, emerges and walks alongside them. Simultaneously, the black car on the right side of the street also moves slightly forward, continuing further away from the viewer.
