The first frame displays an urban night scene, looking down a pedestrian alleyway illuminated by various neon signs. In the immediate foreground to the right, a person with dark hair and a dark top is partially visible, facing slightly away from the viewer. A tiled walkway extends into the alley, flanked on the left by a column with red Chinese characters and parked scooters, and on the right by a shop entrance featuring a food poster. A prominent neon sign with red and green characters hangs above the alley's entrance, which recedes into the background filled with numerous colorful shop signs and indistinct pedestrians.
end of description.
The person on the foreground right moves completely out of frame to the right, revealing more of the shop's interior, including a counter and a menu board now visible on the right wall. Simultaneously, a person in an orange jacket, holding a cup, walks steadily towards the viewer from the far end of the alleyway, gradually moving into the midground. The parked vehicles and shops on the left remain relatively static as this individual approaches.
