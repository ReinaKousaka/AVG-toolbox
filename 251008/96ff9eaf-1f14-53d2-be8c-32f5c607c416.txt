The first frame captures a wet, rain-streaked urban street receding under an overcast sky, featuring a red and yellow striped crosswalk with a '30' speed limit on the left, flanked by metal bollards. A person holding a blue umbrella walks away on the left sidewalk, while garbage and styrofoam containers are visible on the right sidewalk next to storefronts.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the rain continues to fall, making all street surfaces increasingly reflective. The person with the blue umbrella moves further away into the distance on the left sidewalk, and a new person carrying a yellow umbrella appears on the right sidewalk, also walking away from the viewer. Simultaneously, water visibly flows and accumulates more along the right-side gutter near the drain relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame presents a wet, red-painted street with a large "30" speed limit marking in the foreground. To the viewer's left, a sidewalk bordered by silver barriers leads past a tree and multi-story buildings, where a person walks away under a dark umbrella. On the right, a narrower wet sidewalk runs alongside storefronts of multi-story buildings, featuring a visible metal grate. The street recedes into the distance, where a white car is visible, all beneath an overcast sky.

Over the subsequent frames, the individual under the dark umbrella on the left sidewalk gradually moves further away from the viewer. Simultaneously, a new person, clad in a yellow rain jacket or holding a yellow umbrella, emerges from behind the buildings on the right sidewalk and proceeds to walk away from the viewer.

The first frame depicts a wet city street looking forward, lined with multi-story buildings under an overcast sky. To the immediate left is a red-orange lane with white markings, separated by a yellow line from the central wet asphalt road, while to the right is a wet concrete sidewalk with a brown mat and metal grate. In the midground, a person with a blue umbrella walks away on the left sidewalk, green railings line the red lane, and a yellow scooter is parked on the right sidewalk, with a white car visible further down the road ahead.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the person with the blue umbrella moves progressively further away along the left sidewalk ahead of the viewer. Simultaneously, the yellow scooter travels further down the street on the right side, and the white car in the far distance continues to recede ahead.
