The first frame depicts a city street looking forward, with a dark SUV occupying the immediate foreground on the right. A sidewalk with an 'UGG' banner and trash bags runs along the left, while a cobblestone street, lined with parked cars and flanked by multi-story buildings, recedes into the distance.

Across the following frames, the dark SUV in the foreground gradually moves away from the viewer, progressively revealing more of the cobblestone street and the white car previously partially hidden directly behind it on the right. This continuous movement unveils additional parked cars further down the street on the right side.

The first frame presents a view down a narrow city street from a sidewalk perspective. To the immediate right, the rear portion of a dark SUV is visible. In the center foreground on the sidewalk, a pile of white trash bags and cardboard rests next to a black fire hydrant, positioned slightly left of the trash. On the viewer's left, a light-colored building facade with white vertical elements and a dark awning is seen, accompanied by a vertical stand displaying papers near its entrance. The cobblestone street stretches into the midground, lined with parked cars on both sides; a silver SUV is prominent on the left, while various sedans are on the right. A tall, black ornamental street lamp stands in the middle of the street, and red-brick buildings with fire escapes line the right side, contrasting with lighter buildings further down the left displaying a red "Dior" sign.

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly to the left relative to the first frame's original position. The dark SUV on the immediate right foreground gradually moves further to the viewer's right, eventually receding almost entirely from view. Concurrently, the white trash bags and fire hydrant, initially in the center, drift towards the right and appear slightly further away from the viewer's initial fixed perspective. More of the pale building facade and the adjacent dark entrance on the viewer's left becomes increasingly visible, expanding the scene further to the left of the initial field of view. The entire street and the distant buildings appear to pan slightly to the left, revealing new areas of the sidewalk and road previously out of frame on the viewer's left.

The first frame presents a straight city street, bordered by buildings, under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a graffiti-covered silver fire hydrant and a pile of trash are to the viewer's right, while a dark, recessed building entrance with more graffiti is visible behind a partial metal structure on the left. Parked cars occupy the cobblestone street on the right, and buildings with fire escapes extend into the distance on both sides.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The metal structure on the left slides away to the viewer's left, fully revealing the graffiti-covered wall behind it, while the fire hydrant and trash pile recede from the lower right of the frame and disappear.
