The first frame depicts a city street scene with a black convertible car partially visible in the immediate foreground on the right. A paved sidewalk extends from the bottom left, running parallel to a row of parked cars, including a silver SUV, and several bare trees separating the sidewalk from the street on the right. On the far left, a large multi-story building with numerous windows is prominent, while on the right, another multi-story building features a "LEIHHAUS" sign on its ground floor. A group of pedestrians walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk in the midground, with more buildings visible in the distant background under an overcast sky.
end of description
The camera subtly shifts forward and slightly to the right from the initial viewpoint. This causes the black convertible in the foreground to gradually exit the frame towards the right, revealing more of the sidewalk on the left. Concurrently, the group of pedestrians continues moving further into the distance, appearing smaller and deeper within the scene relative to the first-frame viewpoint. All other parked vehicles and buildings maintain their stationary positions relative to the initial viewpoint, although their framing subtly adjusts due to the camera's movement.
