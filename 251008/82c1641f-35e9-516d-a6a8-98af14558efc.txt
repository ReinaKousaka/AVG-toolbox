The first frame captures a sunny park scene featuring a wide reddish-brown paved area in the foreground. To the left of this path, a curb borders an area where several pedicabs and bicycles are parked: a partially visible black pedicab on the far left, a yellow pedicab with passengers in the mid-left, and a black pedicab with people standing near it further right. In the background, lush green trees and some with bare branches stand beneath a clear blue sky, with city buildings visible in the distance beyond the foliage.

The camera subtly zooms out and pans slightly to the right throughout the following frames. This gradual shift reveals a bit more of the paved area and the vendor stand with its green umbrella on the far right, making additional people interacting there visible. A person standing near the central blue bicycle in the midground remains largely still but is reframed by the subtle camera motion. The passengers in the yellow pedicab in the mid-left exhibit minimal, almost imperceptible, movement within their seats.

The first frame displays a sunny park scene with a red-brown paved area in the foreground and a sidewalk to the left, where multiple pedicabs and bicycles are parked. In the midground, several people are visible walking on a path, alongside more pedicabs and two green-canopied food carts surrounded by individuals on the right. The background features trees with nascent foliage, distant city buildings, and a clear blue sky.

A person in a light hoodie, initially positioned mid-left, begins walking from right to left across the path. Subsequently, another person in a dark jacket moves in the same direction, traversing the path further behind the stationary pedicabs. Both individuals continue their steady progression towards the left side of the frame through the sequence.
