The first frame captures a rainy city street at night, featuring a person in a dark hooded jacket walking away on the left, alongside a building decorated with green foliage and gold ornaments. To the viewer's immediate right, a red and white striped pole stands prominently, partially obscuring a row of trash bins and a parked black SUV further down the wet street, which is lined with distant illuminated buildings under a grey sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the person on the left moves forward and out of view, revealing more of the storefront facade to the left of the original viewpoint. Concurrently, the red and white striped pole on the right recedes from the frame, uncovering more of the parked vehicles and the street area that was previously behind it. The camera subtly advances, causing the entire street scene, including the reflective wet pavement and distant buildings, to appear closer and expand, revealing more of the environment to both the left and right of the initial perspective.

The first frame shows a wet, rainy city street at night, with a building's reflective windows and green foliage on the left. On the right, a black object and stacked cardboard boxes line the sidewalk, which extends towards distant illuminated buildings and streetlights under a hazy sky. end of description
In subsequent frames, from the same viewpoint, a white bag marked 'New York Vegetables' enters the scene from the far right foreground. It moves leftward across the frame, passing in front of the stack of cardboard boxes and partially obscuring them as it progresses towards the left.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a wet city street at night stretches into the distance, reflecting the ambient light from surrounding buildings. To the immediate foreground right, a brown paper bag labeled "New York Vegetables" partially obscures a dark metal bin. A building with large reflective windows lines the left midground, reflecting streetlights and distant vehicle headlights. Tall, illuminated city buildings rise on both sides of the street, extending into an overcast night sky.
end of description
Subsequently, the foreground paper bag moves progressively out of view to the right of the initial position. The viewpoint then advances forward and slightly to the left, revealing more of the dark metal bins on the right, including a distinct mailbox and a newspaper stand. An umbrella briefly obstructs the top left corner of the frame before moving out of sight. The street ahead and distant buildings become more defined as the camera continues to move forward from its original position.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a wet, rainy city street at night. To the viewer's immediate right is a dark, rectangular street bin, and to the left, a tall building with reflective glass storefronts showing pinkish interior glows. A street lamp stands prominently in the mid-ground, illuminating the wet street and sidewalk that stretch into the distance, reflecting various building lights. Tall buildings with numerous lit windows line both sides of the street, with distant skyscrapers fading into the hazy, dark sky.
end of description
The camera subtly pans to the right, gradually revealing more of the street and the multi-story building on the right side of the frame. A white van, previously partially obscured, becomes fully visible parked further down the street to the right, and a traffic light appears on the far right mid-ground. The left building's reflective facade consequently occupies slightly less of the frame.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a nighttime city street scene from a low vantage point on a wet sidewalk, with a black bin visible to the immediate right. A building with pink-glowing storefront windows lines the left, reflecting on the glistening pavement leading to a street light pole with signs in the midground. Across the wet street to the right stands a tall building with numerous lit windows and street traffic, while more city buildings recede into the hazy background.
end of description
The camera slowly pans forward, causing the black bin, initially in the foreground to the right, to recede and eventually exit the lower right corner of the frame. This movement reveals more of the wet sidewalk and street on the right, maintaining the overall static-but-moving impression relative to the initial first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A wet city street at night is visible, with a dark building displaying a "T-Mobile" sign on the left and another building with illuminated windows on the right. In the center, a street light pole with a "NO STANDING" sign stands over a crosswalk, leading towards a distant car with headlights on, while the hood of a dark car is partially seen in the bottom right foreground, closer to the viewer.
end of description
The car in the middle of the street slowly recedes further away from the viewer. Simultaneously, the pedestrian crossing signal on the right side of the street changes from a white "WALK" symbol to an orange "DON'T WALK" hand. Concurrently, the traffic light situated further down the street to the right transitions from what appears to be green or off to an amber, then a red signal.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a wet, reflective city street stretches from the foreground into the distance under a dark sky. To the immediate left, a T-Mobile storefront with "T-Mobile" visible at the top is partially obscured by rolling shutters over its large windows. A street pole stands centrally, featuring traffic lights and a "Madison Ave" sign pointing to the left, with another pole and a "NO STANDING ANYTIME" sign on the right. In the mid-ground, vehicles with illuminated headlights proceed away from the viewer on the rain-slicked road, flanked by pedestrians on both sidewalks and tall city buildings rising in the background. A crosswalk is visible across the street in the foreground and mid-ground.
end of description
Following frames show the rolling shutters on the T-Mobile storefront, located to the left of the viewer, progressively closing. Initially partially open, they steadily descend across the subsequent frames, eventually covering most of the storefront windows. This dynamic change occurs consistently within the same spatial position relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
