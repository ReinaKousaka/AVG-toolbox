The first frame presents a large, illuminated building with decorative pillars and arches adorned with white and yellow string lights on the left. A paved walkway extends from the mid-ground towards the right, where several pedestrians are seen walking away from the viewer. Across the street, a brightly lit store with a white sign and another with a red sign are visible against a twilight sky, while a lush green bush is positioned in the far right foreground.

As the frames progress, the pedestrians continue moving along the walkway away from the viewer. A red and blue motorized tricycle appears on the street, slowly progressing towards the right. Simultaneously, a tall, illuminated church tower in the far background on the right becomes increasingly visible.
