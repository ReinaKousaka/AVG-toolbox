The first frame displays a night scene on a city pedestrian street. On the far left, a white vending machine is visible, next to a light-colored building wall featuring two illuminated rectangular advertisements, and a metal barrier with yellow horizontal bars running alongside the path. On the right, multiple storefronts are illuminated with signs, including "4C" and others with Japanese text, showcasing various businesses. In the foreground, a blurred woman in a white top and dark pants, wearing a mask, is moving towards the viewer on the right, while a masked man with a black shoulder bag walks centrally, also towards the viewer. Behind them, further down the street, more masked pedestrians are visible, along with a darker multi-story building in the background featuring a "THE BODY SHOP" sign.
end of description
Initially, three masked individuals walk towards the viewer: a woman in white on the right foreground, and two men, one centrally with a shoulder bag and one further right. The woman in white and the man on the far right exit the frame to the viewer's right as the central man with the shoulder bag approaches. This central man then passes the viewer to the left. Subsequently, a masked woman in a dark top with a dark bag appears from the mid-ground, walking towards and then passing the viewer to the left. Finally, another masked woman in a grey top and dark pants enters from the mid-ground on the right, also approaching and eventually passing the viewer on the right.
