The first frame displays a street scene featuring a wide pedestrian crossing in the foreground, with a brick building, a trash can, and a white police booth visible to the left. In the midground, a street pole with "Sutton Pl" and "Sutton Sq" signs and a "DEAD END" sign stands near traffic lights to the right, all framed by green trees and distant buildings under a blue sky.

The subsequent frames show no dynamic changes or newly revealed objects; only very minor, almost imperceptible shifts in the overall scene are observed, indicating slight camera movement.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
In the first frame, a street scene is captured, featuring a crosswalk with white stripes directly in the foreground. To the left, a multi-story red brick building with white windows and dark shutters stands behind a manicured green hedge and a thin tree trunk. Adjacent to the tree and closer to the viewer, a grey cylindrical trash can is visible, followed by a small white and blue police booth displaying "POLICE" and a crest. In the center, a black pole holds a green "SUTTON PL" street sign, a pedestrian signal showing a white walking figure, and further right, a yellow 'DEAD END' sign. The right side of the frame features another road branching off with a crosswalk, bordered by trees, and some distant construction scaffolding.

There are no dynamic changes or newly revealed objects in the subsequent frames; the entire scene remains static throughout.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a street scene is visible with a crosswalk in the immediate foreground. To the left, a multi-story red brick building with white-framed windows stands behind a small tree and a gray cylindrical trash can. Centered in the mid-ground is a white "POLICE" booth with a crest, positioned on the sidewalk in front of green hedges. To the right of the booth, a black lamppost features a pedestrian signal showing a white walking figure and a yellow "DEAD END" sign above it. The sidewalk extends from the police booth and lamppost, curving into the background where more trees and a street with a black car are seen on the right.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the camera executes an extremely subtle zoom-in while simultaneously panning slightly to the right. This minute movement causes the brick building on the far left to gradually recede slightly out of frame on the left, while the objects on the right side of the frame, such as the distant street and trees, become marginally more prominent. No new objects are revealed in the scene; the changes are solely due to the subtle camera adjustment.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a police booth centrally located on a sidewalk, featuring "POLICE" text on its top and a "Police Department City of New York" shield logo on its lower front. To its left is a cylindrical gray trash can, and behind it to the far left, a red brick building with windows and a green hedge. To the right of the booth, a black lamppost holds a green signal box, a pedestrian signal, and a yellow "DEAD END" sign, while a street and distant trees occupy the background.
end of description
The viewpoint shifts right and slightly forward in the following frames, causing the trash can to exit the scene to the left, and the red brick building to become less visible on the far left. Simultaneously, the police booth and lamppost move left relative to the viewer, revealing more of the sidewalk, street, and distant trees previously to the right of the lamppost. The "DEAD END" sign also moves further to the right and eventually out of frame.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a white and grey police booth on the left, bearing a "POLICE DEPARTMENT" emblem and reflecting a white car. To the right, a green traffic control box on a black pole stands, while a concrete sidewalk stretches into the background, bordered by low hedges and a fence on the left and trees on the right, with a distant city skyline visible.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly pans to the right, gradually moving the police booth out of the frame to the far left. This reveals more of a red brick building with white windows and an entrance to the left of the pathway. Concurrently, the green traffic control box moves out of frame to the far right, uncovering a street with a black car and a red and yellow sign to the right of the path, offering a wider view of the surrounding urban landscape.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a red brick building with white-framed windows and an arched entryway occupying the left side, bordered in the foreground by manicured green hedges behind a black railing. To the right, a concrete sidewalk extends forward, flanked by large trees, a parked black SUV, and a cobblestone street with distant city buildings visible beyond a fence at the horizon.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the sidewalk, the brick building and hedges on the left recede further to the viewer's left. Simultaneously, the parked black SUV and the distant cityscape on the right subtly shift leftward relative to the advancing viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a red brick building with white windows, black shutters, and a prominent black front door with white steps occupies the left side. Manicured green hedges, bordered by a black metal railing, line the base of the building. A light concrete sidewalk extends from the foreground into the mid-ground, while on the right, three trees with light trunks stand alongside a cobblestone street, partially obscuring a parked black SUV. In the far background, distant city buildings are faintly visible through the trees and beyond a black fence, with a yellow 'END' sign and a red traffic light on the far right.
end of description
As the camera slowly moves forward, the red brick building and its hedges on the left become closer and more prominent, sliding further into the frame. Concurrently, the trees on the right and the parked black SUV also approach the viewer, shifting slightly to the left relative to their initial positions. The background cityscape appears slightly clearer as the viewpoint advances along the sidewalk.
