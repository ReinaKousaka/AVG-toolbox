frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
In the first frame, the viewer is centered on a set of train tracks extending into the distant background. To the immediate left, two parallel tracks host a long, stationary freight train with various containers, notably yellow DHL and green ones. On the right, a gravel area features scattered orange pipes and cables, along with a white UCO utility trailer further back. A large concrete overpass spans horizontally across the midground, with distant buildings behind it, while a tree-covered hillside with autumn foliage rises on the far right, all beneath an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves steadily forward along the central tracks. The freight train on the left appears to recede, revealing new containers like 'DB SCHENKER' and 'Bring' as the viewer passes by. Concurrently, the UCO utility trailer on the right moves out of frame, while additional orange pipes, a wooden cable spool, and some lumber become visible on the gravel area. The overhead concrete overpass and the distant hillside remain largely static relative to the background, subtly approaching as the viewer advances.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a railway junction with tracks extending directly ahead, while a long freight train with containers (DB Schenker, REMA 1000) occupies parallel tracks to the left. A concrete overpass crosses the mid-ground, with buildings beyond it to the far left, and a tall utility pole stands right of the central tracks, next to orange pipes and wood on the ground, with an autumn-colored hillside in the background to the far right.

end of description

As the frames advance, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the freight train on the left tracks to appear progressively behind the viewer's initial position. The utility pole and construction materials initially visible to the right move further right and eventually behind the viewer, while new sections of tracks and the hillside to the right are continuously revealed ahead.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the foreground, multiple train tracks lead into the distance. To the viewer's immediate left, a gray utility box stands beside the tracks. On parallel tracks in the mid-ground to the left, a white freight train with "DB SCHENKER" and "REMA 1000" logos is visible. A large concrete overpass spans across the mid-ground, while city buildings appear to the far left and an autumn-colored hillside to the far right. Distant trains are visible beneath the overpass, and overhead electrical wires crisscross the sky. "Vmax: 30km/h" is displayed bottom-left.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the gray utility box moves to the left and eventually passes behind the original first-frame viewpoint. The white freight train on the left also progresses, with its "DB SCHENKER" container moving out of view to the left and behind, and subsequent "REMA 1000" containers appearing, passing, and then moving behind the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, the tracks directly in front of the viewer extend forward into the scene, while the distant trains under the overpass slowly appear closer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a train yard with two main tracks extending from the foreground towards the center. A large concrete overpass stretches across the mid-ground, with a long white freight train bearing "REMA 1000" logos parked on parallel tracks to the left. To the right, a complex network of tracks and two distant passenger trains are visible, all under an open sky with a tree-covered hill in the far right background. end of description. The viewpoint moves forward, causing the freight train on the left to recede and eventually exit the frame to the left-rear. As the viewer progresses, a signal pole on the left track side passes by, and the concrete overpass moves upward and backward, revealing more of the station environment ahead as the parked passenger trains on the right become clearer.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a railway junction under a large concrete overpass. Multiple tracks extend into the distance, with the viewer positioned centrally on one set of tracks. To the far left, a stationary freight train with white containers is visible, while to the far right, two passenger trains are parked on parallel tracks.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, a black stack of items and a large concrete pillar emerge from the left foreground, passing the viewer's initial position. Concurrently, more of the freight train's 'DB Schenker' containers become visible to the left as the viewpoint moves past it. On the right, a brown electrical box appears and passes by, while the stationary passenger trains recede further into the midground relative to the advancing viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame reveals a train station scene from a ground-level perspective, centered on a set of tracks extending into the distance under an overhead concrete bridge. A large grey pillar stands to the viewer's immediate left, and a brown box is in the lower right; freight and passenger trains are positioned to the left of the central tracks, behind the pillar, with another passenger train further down the tracks to the right.
end of description
As frames progress, a green container train replaces a white freight car to the left of the central tracks, subsequently moving forward to reveal more 'DB SCHENKER' freight cars behind it. Simultaneously, the red and white passenger train, also on the left tracks, progresses steadily forward from behind the initial grey pillar. This movement reveals more of the passenger train as it passes the pillar, which itself becomes fully visible with graffiti at its base. The passenger train on the right and the brown box in the lower right remain stationary throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows the viewer positioned directly on a central railway track, looking forward towards a distant station or tunnel entrance. To the left, a white, red, and grey train is stationary on a parallel track, with modern buildings behind it and a "DB Schenker" container in the far left foreground. To the right, a white and orange train rests on an adjacent track next to a platform, backed by a hill covered in autumn foliage. Numerous overhead power lines and support structures span the scene.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses steadily forward along the central track, causing the train on the left to slowly move out of frame, revealing more of its length and eventually passing it. Concurrently, the train on the right also recedes, revealing more of its carriages and the platform alongside. Smaller trackside objects like a yellow marker on the right appear closer as the viewer advances further into the railway area.
