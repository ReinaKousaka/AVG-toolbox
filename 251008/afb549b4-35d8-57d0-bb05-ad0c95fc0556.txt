In the first frame, the backs of two people are closest to the viewer; one with dark hair in a light top on the right, and another with brown hair in a gray t-shirt on the center-left. Behind them, a dense crowd of people, some in traditional hanbok, moves towards and through a large, ornate traditional Korean gate that dominates the upper portion of the frame with its colorful roof. Through the gate's archways, modern city buildings are visible in the distant background.

Over the subsequent frames, the crowd continues to move forward towards the gate, with individuals shifting positions relative to the viewer. Notably, a large light blue umbrella with dark patterns gradually emerges from the far left of the frame, moving inward and expanding its visible area to the viewer's left.
