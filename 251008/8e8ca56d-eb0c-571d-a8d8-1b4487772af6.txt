The first frame shows a damp city street stretching into the distance under an overcast sky, viewed from a forward-moving perspective. In the foreground, white arrow markings are painted on the asphalt, with white barriers lining the left side of the road. To the left, beyond the barriers, are parked cars, multi-story residential buildings, and green trees, along with a prominent blue informational sign. On the right, large green trees shade parked cars lining the curb, fronting commercial buildings with storefronts, while a no-stopping sign and a blue parking sign are also visible. A navigation map overlay is present in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the road, white barriers, parked cars, and buildings on both sides continuously recede and pass the viewer. New sections of the wet road, additional vehicles, trees, and buildings are progressively revealed directly ahead in the distance. The blue sign on the left approaches and eventually passes by, while the navigation map's displayed distance updates. Yellow road markings, likely indicating speed bumps, become visible on the road surface directly in front of the viewer in later frames.

The first frame displays a wet, straight road extending forward, with a white safety barrier and parked cars on the left, and a large tree, parked vehicles, and buildings with a bus stop on the right. Multi-story residential and commercial buildings line both sides of the street, under an overcast sky, with a navigation overlay in the top-left.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, foreground elements like the initial large tree on the right and the white barriers on the left gradually move out of frame, becoming behind the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, previously distant buildings, more sections of storefronts, and additional parked vehicles are continuously revealed to the left and right, moving closer as the scene progresses, while the navigation display updates.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a straight, wet asphalt road stretching into the distance under a bright, overcast sky. On the left, a row of multi-story residential buildings with balconies stands behind white metal fences, interspersed with trees, while a traffic light pole with red and green signals is visible further left, overlaid with an augmented reality (AR) navigation display showing a blue curved arrow and a countdown of '10'. On the right, parked cars line a sidewalk adorned with trees, a bus stop shelter with advertisements, and a decorative street lamp, all in front of various commercial and residential buildings.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily advances along the road. The white fences on the left and the bus stop and street lamp on the right gradually recede and move further to the sides and out of the frame as new segments of the road and sidewalks are revealed ahead. The AR navigation overlay updates, with the traffic light countdown decreasing from '10' to '9', reflecting the viewer's progression towards the intersection previously ahead.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a wet, multi-lane asphalt road stretching into the distance under an overcast sky, flanked by a white barrier and buildings on the left, and parked cars, trees, and buildings on the right. A navigation overlay showing traffic lights and a turn arrow is visible in the upper-left.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the white barrier on the left, parked cars and trees on the right, and buildings on both sides gradually shift from the foreground to the sides and then recede, revealing new sections of the street ahead. Concurrently, the navigation overlay's traffic light countdown decreases from 9 to 0, and the traffic lights transition from red to green. A small brown booth eventually becomes visible on the right sidewalk, further down the road from the initial position.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The viewer is positioned on a multi-lane city street, looking straight ahead as it recedes into the distance under an overcast sky. White road barriers line the left side, separating the viewer's lane from the sidewalk and adjacent buildings, which are partially obscured by dense green trees. On the right, a sidewalk features more trees, a small reddish-brown kiosk-like structure, parked vehicles including a white van, and various buildings. A navigation overlay with route graphics, including a prominent blue arched arrow and multiple circular icons, is visible in the upper left corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The navigation overlay updates, revealing a countdown number '6' which later changes to '5' next to the red dot. Concurrently, objects on the sides, such as the white van and the kiosk on the right, appear to move further into the background and eventually out of view, while new sections of storefronts and street features emerge into the foreground as the scene advances.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The initial frame presents a wet, multi-lane urban road extending into the distance under an overcast sky, flanked by white barriers and buildings on the left, and trees, parked cars, and a blue overhead sign on the right, with an AR navigation overlay showing a red traffic light in the upper-left.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, white turn arrows on the road surface ahead become visible and clearer, while the blue overhead sign on the right shifts left and enlarges. The AR overlay's traffic light countdown decreases, turning green around mid-sequence before resetting and resuming its countdown. Concurrently, the buildings and parked vehicles on both sides continuously grow in size, indicating steady progression through the urban landscape.
