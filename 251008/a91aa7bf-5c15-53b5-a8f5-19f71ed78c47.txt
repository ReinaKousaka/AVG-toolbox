In the first frame, a multi-story building with balconies and ground-floor shops occupies the left, bordering an asphalt road that curves slightly right. A dark-colored car drives away from the viewer on this road, while a white van is parked to the right, next to a signpost displaying directional arrows and three green indicators. Lush green trees flank the right side, with more traditional buildings visible on a verdant hillside in the midground. Majestic snow-capped mountains, partially veiled by clouds, loom in the background under a bright blue sky.

Throughout the frames, the dark car on the road slowly progresses further away from the viewer, receding into the distance. A key dynamic change occurs on the signpost positioned to the right of the road. Initially, all three parking availability indicators on the signpost are green. Subsequently, the top indicator for 'Graben First' dynamically changes from green to red, while the 'P Pringstegg' and 'P Oberer Gletscher' indicators below it remain green.

The first frame displays a scenic mountain village street curving uphill, flanked on the left by multi-story buildings with balconies and shops, and on the right by a parked white van and a digital parking information sign. A brown car drives uphill in the midground, while lush green hills and scattered houses ascend towards the towering, snow-capped mountains in the distant background under a blue sky.

In subsequent frames, the brown car moves further up the road, receding into the distance from the viewer. Concurrently, the digital display on the signpost to the right dynamically updates, showing the "Graben/First" and "Pfingstegg" parking statuses flickering between "FREI" (free) and "BESETZT" (occupied) relative to their fixed positions on the sign.

The first frame depicts a charming village street with multi-story buildings featuring wooden balconies and ground-floor shops on the left. A paved road curves into the mid-distance, leading towards traditional houses and lush green hills, culminating in a towering, sunlit mountain range under a blue sky at the background. To the far right, a blue directional sign stands beside a rustic wooden planter, with a small car visible on the road in the midground.
end of description
Chronologically, the small car visible on the road travels further into the distance, eventually turning the bend and disappearing behind the buildings to the right of the original viewpoint. Simultaneously, a person initially seated at an outdoor cafe table to the right of the road subtly shifts their position, appearing to stand up in later frames.
