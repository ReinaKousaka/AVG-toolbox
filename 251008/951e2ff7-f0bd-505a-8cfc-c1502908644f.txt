The first frame depicts a rain-slicked city street at night, with a wet paved sidewalk in the foreground extending to the right and a parallel street to the left. Bare trees with streetlights line the midground, where a green overhead sign, a black pole with a parked scooter, and a glass bus stop are visible, all framed by distant city buildings.

Subsequently, a white car with illuminated red taillights emerges from the far left of the viewer, traveling away into the distance along the wet street. It steadily continues its movement, receding further from the first-frame viewpoint before eventually disappearing from the left background.

The first frame depicts a wet urban street at night, looking down a long, reflective road. In the immediate foreground, a wet crosswalk stretches across the viewer's path. To the left, a multi-lane street extends into the distance with guardrails and yellow barriers, while a tall pole with multiple green directional signs is positioned slightly left of center, with a purple scooter parked on the sidewalk below it. To the right, a row of bare trees with streetlights overhead lines a wet sidewalk, alongside several reflective, translucent barriers. Distant city lights and buildings are visible through the trees and structures in the background.

The camera slowly pulls back and slightly lowers, gradually widening the field of view from the initial position. This movement progressively reveals more of the wet asphalt and the full yellow crosswalk line directly in front of the viewer. Additionally, more of the street to the far left and the reflective barriers on the far right are brought into view, expanding the scene laterally and vertically. No new objects appear, nor do existing objects move within the frame.

The first frame shows a rainy city street at night, with a wet, reflective sidewalk stretching into the distance. A purple electric scooter and an information stand are on the immediate left, beside a bare tree, while green street signs and a bus stop appear further along the left. On the right, large reflective glass panels line the street, with distant city lights and illuminated buildings in the background.
end of description
Throughout the sequence, steady precipitation falls, enhancing reflections as a red bus emerges in the mid-ground road, moving away from the viewer on the right side. The bus continues its path, and later, a white vehicle briefly appears on the far left of the road, moving towards the viewer, before disappearing.
