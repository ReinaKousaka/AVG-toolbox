The first frame shows a wet city street with a prominent pedestrian crosswalk stretching across the immediate foreground. A multi-lane road recedes forward, lined by tall buildings and trees on both sides, with parked and moving vehicles like a silver minivan and dark SUVs visible to the right and further down the street.

Subsequently, a woman wearing a white shirt and face mask, holding an open white umbrella, appears from the right, stepping onto the crosswalk. She proceeds to walk across the street from right to left relative to the viewer, eventually exiting the frame to the far left.

The first frame displays a wet, multi-lane city street stretching into the hazy distance, with prominent white zebra crossing stripes in the immediate foreground. Tall buildings line both sides of the street, featuring parked cars and trees along the sidewalks, while a white SUV with headlights on is visible driving towards the viewer in the distant center, and a dark minivan moves away from the viewer further up the road.

As frames progress, the white SUV with illuminated headlights steadily approaches the viewer in the middle lane from its initial distant position. Simultaneously, the dark minivan continues to recede further away from the viewer, appearing smaller, while a second dark car emerges from behind the white SUV and also moves towards the viewer. All parked vehicles along the sides and the background buildings remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a wet city street on an overcast day, extending away from the viewer. In the foreground, white crosswalk stripes diagonally span the asphalt from the viewer's position. Multiple parked cars line the right sidewalk, with more vehicles visible further down the street on both sides, and a white SUV approaches in the distant center lane. Tall, multi-story buildings flank the street on both the left and right, receding into a hazy background where more structures are visible under a bright, overcast sky.
end of description
A double yellow line and a "50" speed limit marking appear on the wet asphalt directly in front of the viewer, with the yellow line slightly left of center and the "50" marking on the right half of the road. Simultaneously, the brake lights of the dark SUV parked on the far right illuminate with an orange glow. Subsequently, a pedestrian holding a black umbrella and carrying a backpack emerges from the far left, stepping onto the crosswalk. This pedestrian then proceeds to walk across the street from the viewer's left to right, moving towards the center-left. Throughout the sequence, the white SUV in the distant center lane slowly approaches the viewer.
