The first frame shows a wet city street at night with a crosswalk in the foreground reflecting red and green traffic lights and numerous streetlights from buildings lining the long road stretching into the distance.
end of description
The initial frames show the wet street and reflections. By the third frame, a person holding a white umbrella and wearing a red jacket emerges from the right side of the frame, stepping onto the crosswalk in the midground. This individual then steadily walks across the crosswalk from right to left, moving further into the scene towards the left midground over the subsequent frames.
