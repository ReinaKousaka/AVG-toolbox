In the first frame, a large, multi-story, tan-colored apartment building dominates the background and center, featuring numerous windows and balconies. A street extends across the midground, with a silver car positioned on the left side facing away from the viewer and the rear of a black car partially visible on the far right. A traffic light pole with a green light is on the right side of the road, and palm trees are visible on the far left, behind the silver car. Green graffiti adorns the ground floor shutters of the main building.

The black car on the far right moves forward and exits the frame to the right, while the initially green traffic light (on the right) changes to red. A person walking on the sidewalk behind the grey car (to the left) becomes visible and progresses further left. Subsequently, a black scooter with a brown delivery box and a rider in an orange helmet enters the foreground from the right, moving left past the stationary grey car.
