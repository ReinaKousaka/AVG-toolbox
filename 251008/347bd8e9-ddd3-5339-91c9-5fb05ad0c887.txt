The first frame shows a gray asphalt road curving from the bottom center towards the middle right. To its immediate left, a strip of grass borders dense, light green/grey bushy plants, with a white pole featuring a red band at the far left. Beyond these bushes, a smaller road or driveway branches off to the left. The right side of the main road is lined with green trees and bushes, while in the mid-background, rolling hills rise under a partly cloudy blue sky, eventually leading to a mountain range on the horizon.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily advances along the road, which continues to curve to the right relative to the initial forward path. The large light-colored bushes on the immediate left quickly recede behind the viewer, revealing more of a steep, vegetated embankment on the left, now featuring some yellow-flowered plants. The small branching road on the mid-left of the first frame is passed and recedes to the left. As the camera moves forward, a wooden fence becomes newly visible further along the road on the right side. The distant mountains remain in the general background but shift more to the left side of the frame due to the road's curvature.
