The first frame displays a wet, reflective urban alleyway receding into the background, bordered by buildings. A pale, columned building and a planter are on the left foreground, while a large construction hoarding featuring cityscapes occupies the right foreground and midground.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the pedestrians within the alleyway are actively moving. Most individuals in the midground walk further away into the distance. Simultaneously, a person on the right side, wearing a dark jacket and green shirt, consistently moves towards the viewer, becoming more prominent in the foreground.

The first frame presents a wet, cobbled city street receding into the distance, framed by buildings. To the immediate right, a large promotional board displays architectural renderings, while a young man in a dark jacket and green t-shirt walks towards the viewer on the right side of the path. Further down the wet street, several people walk away from the viewer towards the background. On the left, a grand building with prominent columns stretches along the street, and a red bin/newsstand is visible closer to the viewer. The right side features a building under construction, obscured by temporary black and white hoardings with graffiti, and scaffolding visible above.
end of description
The young man initially on the right walks past the viewer, exiting the frame to the left. Subsequently, another person, partially visible on the far right, moves into the frame, continuing the leftward progression relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the group of individuals walking away in the distance recedes further down the street, and a person standing near the red bin on the far left becomes more distinct as the sequence progresses.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame captures a wet, cobbled street extending from the viewer, bordered by buildings. A columned structure with a dark signpost and people around a red 'FREE' cart occupies the left, while a dark construction hoarding and a graffiti-covered wall with silver branch decor are on the right. Numerous pedestrians are walking away from the viewer down the street's center and along its sides, with distant buildings under a bright sky visible in the background.

end of description
Over the subsequent frames, the central group of pedestrians progresses further away down the street. A person initially on the far left moves from the mid-left foreground towards the extreme left, eventually disappearing from view, while other individuals on both sides of the street generally shift positions further into the background relative to the first-frame viewpoint without revealing new scenes.

The first frame depicts a wet, reflective street extending into the distance, bordered by an arched, light-colored building on the left and a red construction hoarding with a lit poster on the right. Several pedestrians are walking away from the viewer down the street, while a person in a blue jacket and some materials are to the far left.
end of description
Throughout subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly advances down the street. The initial pedestrians recede further, as new individuals emerge from the mid-distance, walking towards the camera's original position, most notably a couple on the right. Concurrently, the illuminated poster on the right hoarding transitions from a dark image to a bright blue one.

The first frame captures a bustling urban street scene on a wet pavement. On the immediate right, a woman in a maroon coat and a man in a tan coat with glasses walk arm-in-arm towards the viewer, alongside a tall red construction hoarding with partially visible white text. To the left, a woman in a pink puffer coat stands next to a man in a suit, both near black wheeled suitcases; another person in a light blue denim jacket has their back to the viewer. A group of pedestrians fills the mid-ground, walking away from the viewer, while arched buildings line the left, and distant shops and a bare tree are visible in the background.
end of description
In the following frames, the woman in maroon and the man in tan on the immediate right continue walking past and out of the frame towards the bottom-right. A woman in a dark jacket carrying a light blue shopping bag appears from the mid-right and moves towards the viewer. Subsequently, a woman in a gray puffer coat, talking on her phone, emerges from behind the red hoarding on the far right, becoming more prominent in the foreground. The group of pedestrians in the center moves further away from the viewer, while the people near the suitcases on the far left remain largely stationary.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a wet, reflective urban street is bustling with pedestrians. On the far left, a woman in a pink hooded jacket talks on a phone, standing next to a man in a dark suit jacket carrying a black bag, with another person partially visible behind them. In the mid-ground center, a bearded man in a dark jacket walks towards the viewer, part of a crowd moving both towards and away from the viewer. On the far right, a woman in a grey fur-hooded jacket talks on a phone while standing beside a reddish-brown hoarding that features illuminated vertical signs and extends into the distance. The background reveals a mix of classical buildings with arches on the left and shopfronts with illuminated windows on the right, all leading down a long street under a dull sky.
end of description
The people in the foreground and mid-ground begin to move, with the woman in the pink jacket and the man beside her on the far left moving away from the viewer's left. Simultaneously, the woman in the grey jacket on the far right slowly walks out of the frame to the right, gradually revealing more of the hoarding. The bearded man in the dark jacket, initially in the mid-ground, continues walking towards and then past the viewer's left. As these figures depart, a black and gold rubbish bin is fully revealed on the left side of the street, and a man in a light blue denim jacket is seen walking away from the viewer in the mid-ground left.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a wet city street receding into the distance, lined by buildings with illuminated shop windows. To the immediate left, a woman stands near a dark trash bin and a rectangular planter, while a large reddish-brown hoarding with text and logos occupies the right foreground. Several pedestrians, including a man in a brown coat and another in a denim jacket, are visible walking away from the viewer down the middle of the street.
end of description
As the frames progress, the pedestrians initially visible continue to move further away from the viewer down the street. A new woman in a light grey hoodie and black pants, carrying a dark bag, emerges from deeper within the scene and walks towards the viewer, approaching from the left mid-ground. Additionally, a brightly lit shop entrance for "UGG" on the right side of the street becomes more distinctly visible as the pedestrians in front of it move deeper into the scene.
