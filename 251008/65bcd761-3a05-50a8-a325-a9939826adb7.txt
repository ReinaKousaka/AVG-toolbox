The first frame presents a forward view down a single set of train tracks receding into the distance under a blue sky with white clouds. Green-covered embankments flank both sides, with utility poles and overhead wires visible overhead and along the edges. A reddish-brown building is partially discernible on the right embankment in the mid-distance, while the bottom of the viewer's vehicle is in the immediate foreground.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward along the tracks; the reddish-brown building on the right embankment approaches and clarifies, and a second set of parallel tracks emerges to its right. Rocky outcrops become visible on the right embankment. Simultaneously, a body of water appears to the far left, behind the initial left-side bushes, followed by open green fields and distant trees further left.
