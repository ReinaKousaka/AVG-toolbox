In the first frame, a street scene unfolds with a large glass-fronted building on the left, reflecting its surroundings. In the foreground left, the back of a person in a purple jacket is visible, walking past the building's windows, which display posters. To the mid-right, a tall black signpost with street names, maps, and a 'No Left Turn Except Cycles' sign is prominently displayed, next to which a group of people waits on the pavement. Further back and to the left, a red double-decker bus is seen on the street, moving away from the viewer, while other pedestrians and traffic are visible further down the road and to the right, near a white coach.

The red double-decker bus in the background left gradually moves out of frame to the far left, while the traffic light on the right edge transitions from green to red. Simultaneously, a yellow step ladder becomes visible inside the building entrance on the far left, and a worker ascends it to adjust something overhead. Concurrently, a man in a red and blue jacket, initially in the mid-ground left, walks progressively closer to the viewer, passing the waiting crowd.

A busy city street scene features a man on a yellow ladder near a building's revolving door on the viewer's left, and a young man in a red vest walking forward on the pavement. To the right and background, numerous pedestrians stand near a crossing with a red traffic light, fronting a modern glass building and older architecture, with vehicles including a red double-decker bus and a white coach present on the street. end of description
Subsequently, the young man continues walking to the right and out of view, while the man on the ladder descends and steps onto the pavement, eventually leaning against the column on the left. The traffic light turns green, and the crowd of pedestrians on the right begins to cross the street, with a red post box becoming more prominent behind them as a white bus departs to the far right.

In the first frame, a man in a dark jacket leans against a dark column to the viewer's immediate left, while two women stand on the sidewalk to the right, facing away, one holding a red bag. Across the street, a red double-decker bus is to the left, a modern glass building with a "Pret" sign is central, and a white bus is to the right, with numerous pedestrians and vehicles populating the bustling intersection.

From the second frame, the man on the left gradually straightens, and the woman on the far right begins walking forward, out of view by the final frame. The double-decker bus to the left slowly moves forward across the street, while the white bus to the right continues moving away from the viewer. Pedestrians throughout the scene consistently move and cross the intersection, reflecting ongoing urban activity relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
