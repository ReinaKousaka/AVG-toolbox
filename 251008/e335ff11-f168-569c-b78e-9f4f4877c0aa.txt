The first frame displays a snow-covered city street at night, featuring a modern building with "KUUSI PALAA" signage and green plants on the left, where a bicycle also leans against a tree. On the right, another building is brightly lit with festive decorations, and a red circular sign is visible near the sidewalk, while overhead, numerous illuminated spherical lights span across the street. A dark car is stationary in the distant center of the road, and green traffic lights are visible further down on both sides.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the dark car initially in the distant center slowly progresses forward along the street. A red car then appears from the far right in frame 6, positioned near the right sidewalk. This red car subsequently moves slowly forward and slightly towards the center of the road relative to the initial viewpoint.

The first frame displays a snow-covered city street at night, with buildings flanking both sides. To the immediate left, a tree trunk is partially visible, with a dark bicycle leaning against it, and a section of a snow-covered sidewalk extends into the foreground. On the left side of the street, a modern building with illuminated "KUUSI PALAA" signage features large windows and vertical yellow Christmas lights, while a green traffic light is visible further down the road. On the right, an older, dark building is also adorned with vertical yellow Christmas lights, and a red traffic light stands in the mid-distance. Overhead, numerous strings of golden spherical Christmas lights span across the street, illuminating the dark, overcast sky above a distant car driving away in the center.

The viewpoint subtly moves forward and slightly right relative to the first-frame position, gradually revealing more of a metallic bike rack emerging from the lower left foreground. The stationary bicycle on the left shifts further out of the central view as the camera advances. A white car appears parked on the right side of the street in the midground, previously obscured. The distant car continues to recede further down the street, remaining in the central background as the scene progresses.

The first frame captures a snowy city street at night, with a prominent, snow-covered tree trunk slightly right of center in the immediate foreground, against which a bicycle leans. To the far left, a reddish pole, also covered in snow, is partially visible. On the mid-ground left stands a modern building displaying "KUUSI" and "PALAC" signs, featuring illuminated glass facades and outdoor seating areas. The snow-covered street, marked by tire tracks, recedes into the distance, where several cars with headlights are visible, along with a green traffic light further down on the left. On the mid-ground right, an older building, also adorned with festive lights, flanks the street, while strings of spherical golden and blue lights hang overhead, illuminating the dark sky. In the far distance, a domed building is faintly discernible amidst the city lights.

The viewpoint dynamically moves forward and slightly right, gradually passing the snow-covered tree trunk and the bicycle leaning against it. This movement progressively reveals more of the bicycle's rear and the snowy ground to its immediate right. As the camera advances, the tree and bicycle shift from their prominent foreground position towards the left side of the frame, becoming increasingly to the left of the viewer's new central axis. This forward motion broadens the view of the illuminated street and distant buildings, which remain centrally located ahead of the viewer.
