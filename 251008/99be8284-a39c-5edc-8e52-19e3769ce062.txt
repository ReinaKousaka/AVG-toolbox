The first frame displays a bustling street scene with a red building facade on the far right, adorned with a vertical arch of green and yellow balloons, beside which a silver ladder leans. In the foreground and midground, a sidewalk is populated by several pedestrians walking towards the viewer, with parked bicycles to their left, and a black and white striped pole with a traffic light further left. In the background, a large brown brick building with a distinctive clock tower stands to the left, while another building with a "McDonald's M" sign is visible to the right under an overcast sky.

In subsequent frames, the pedestrians continuously move forward, with the woman in the white coat and the man in the dark jacket passing by towards the left foreground. A new man in a blue puffer jacket emerges from the midground, walking closer to the viewer, while the traffic light pole shifts further left relative to the frame. Simultaneously, the McDonald's "M" sign on the building to the right becomes more clearly visible as the scene progresses.
