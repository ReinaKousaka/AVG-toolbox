The first frame depicts a vibrant nighttime city street scene with a dark SUV dominating the immediate foreground on the left, its rear and glowing taillights clearly visible. To the right in the foreground, a portion of a red sign or kiosk featuring white text ("THE MUSIC.") is present. The midground and background showcase a bustling pedestrian area filled with numerous people walking, flanked by towering buildings adorned with a multitude of brightly lit digital billboards and static advertisements.

In the subsequent frames, the black SUV in the left foreground slowly advances forward and slightly left, revealing more of its side. Simultaneously, a white police SUV progressively emerges into the mid-left from behind the black SUV, moving further into the scene. Pedestrians continuously animate the midground, walking across the street from right to left and vice versa, as the brightly lit city background remains consistent.
