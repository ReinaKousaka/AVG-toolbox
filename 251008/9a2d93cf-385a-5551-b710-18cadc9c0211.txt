The first frame presents a bustling pedestrian thoroughfare covered by a vast, arched LED screen ceiling displaying dynamic green and blue swirling light patterns directly overhead and extending into the distance. Numerous people populate the wide walkway in the midground, with ornate buildings featuring white and gold arches and a prominent red "46" sign on the right, and various stalls and bright billboards on the left.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly pans right, gradually revealing more of the ornate building facade on the right side and a gold-colored sign at the far right edge of the scene. Simultaneously, the vibrant light show on the LED ceiling subtly shifts its patterns, and the crowd of pedestrians continues to move throughout the entire visible area.
