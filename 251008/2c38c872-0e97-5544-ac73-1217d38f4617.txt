The first frame presents a straight asphalt road, marked with a pedestrian crossing directly ahead, leading towards distant mountains under an overcast sky. Green trees line both sides, partially revealing buildings, while several parked cars and a blue parking sign occupy a parking area to the right.
end of description
As the scene progresses, a yellow traffic light appears high on the right, above the parked cars, before disappearing. Simultaneously, a red-bordered parking sign emerges from the upper right, settling next to and above the blue parking sign. The viewpoint moves forward, traversing the pedestrian crossing, as the parked cars on the right recede and exit the frame. Consequently, the buildings on both sides become much closer and clearer, including one with a visible red roof on the left, as the scene progresses along the road.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame presents a grey asphalt road extending into the distance under an overcast sky, with distant mountains forming the backdrop. To the immediate left, a large tree heavily shadows the foreground, partially obscuring a building with a red-orange roof and a utility pole further down the road. On the right, a blue square "P" parking sign stands prominently, with a light-colored house and dense green foliage behind it.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the large foreground tree on the left recedes and moves out of frame, revealing more of the red-roofed building, which appears to be an old barn. Concurrently, the blue "P" sign and the house on the immediate right move out of view. A row of tall coniferous trees and a wooden fence become visible on the right, with another house emerging further back.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a two-lane road with white markings receding into the distance. To the immediate left is a rustic building with a corrugated roof and green grass, while the right foreground features lush green vegetation and a wooden fence, with tall evergreen trees beyond. In the midground, a streetlamp stands on the left, and far ahead, majestic mountains are visible under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the building on the left recedes out of frame. The streetlamp and evergreen trees on the right approach and enlarge, revealing a pedestrian crossing on the road ahead. New road signs for camping and parking, previously obscured, emerge from behind the trees on the right, followed by a parked white car and more distant directional signs. The road ahead clearly defines an intersection with a small grassy island to the left.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a mountain road, marked with a crosswalk and white lines in the foreground, extending towards distant peaks under a cloudy sky; a street lamp and green foliage are on the left, while a large green signpost, parked cars (including a white Beetle and van), and an overhanging tree branch occupy the right side.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the tree branch and the initial large green signpost on the right move out of frame, revealing new red and blue road signs, a wooden informational panel, and concrete barrier blocks on the right side of the road. Simultaneously, the parked cars on the right also recede, with only the white van remaining partially visible in the later frames, while the overall foreground landscape changes with the forward motion.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays an asphalt road extending from the foreground into the midground, gently curving left, with distant mountains under an overcast sky dominating the background. To the viewer's immediate left, two brown information boards stand on a grassy verge. On the viewer's right, a white bicycle symbol is painted on the road, with a cluster of signs, including a blue diamond, a "LE MONETIER LES BAINS" directional sign, and a '90' speed limit sign, located further along the right grassy verge. Dense green trees border both sides of the road in the midground, situated between the foreground signs and the distant mountains.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, all foreground and midground objects shift relative to the initial viewpoint. The information boards on the left move progressively closer and then out of frame to the left of the viewer. Simultaneously, the bicycle symbol on the road and the cluster of signs on the right, including the "LE MONETIER LES BAINS" sign, move towards the viewer and then exit the frame to the right. The '90' speed limit sign, initially positioned further along the right verge relative to the viewer, becomes more prominent before also moving past and out of frame to the right. The road continues its slight left curve, revealing more of the path ahead from the initial viewpoint, while the distant mountains and trees subtly shift perspective as the viewer advances.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a paved road curving left into the mid-ground, with white dashed lines on the right and a solid-dashed line on the left. To the right, a red circular '90' speed limit sign stands by a grassy verge, backed by dense green trees that extend into the mid-ground, matching similar trees on the left. Distant, rugged mountains under a cloudy sky fill the background, with a small illuminated sign visible near the road's curve.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, the '90' speed limit sign moves out of the frame to the right, effectively passing behind the viewer's original position. The trees on both sides advance and pass by the viewer. A new white arrow road marking, pointing left, appears on the road ahead. The illuminated sign and the distant mountains remain ahead, slowly growing larger as the vehicle approaches them.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A two-lane road with white dashed lines on the right and a solid line on the left extends into the distance, curving slightly to the left then to the right, bordered by green grass and trees on both sides. In the midground, a green road sign and a blurry orange electronic sign are visible on the right side of the road, while dark, jagged mountains rise in the background under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the road, the roadside trees and vegetation on both sides gradually move closer and expand out of frame. The green road sign and the orange electronic sign on the right side of the road also approach. The electronic sign sequentially clarifies its display, first appearing hazy, then distinctly showing "10°C", and finally "12.5°C". The distant mountains in the background remain visible, becoming marginally clearer as the vehicle advances.
