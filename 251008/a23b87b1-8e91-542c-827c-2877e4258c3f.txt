frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a train track stretching into the distance, centrally positioned from the viewer's perspective, with green grassy fields occupying the mid-ground on both sides. To the far left, a small hill with a building is visible, while a line of trees and a forested hillside extend along the right. Overhead, a cloudy sky dominates, and an overlay indicates the current speed as 84 KPH, distance 0.3 km, and altitude 732 m.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the tracks. The on-screen speed gradually increases from 84 KPH to 88 KPH, and the distance traveled updates from 0.3 km to 0.4 km. A tall, grey utility pole, not visible in the initial frame, progressively appears to the right of the tracks, advancing from a position ahead of the first-frame viewpoint and moving towards its right side. The surrounding landscape, including the green fields and distant hills, subtly shifts as the first-frame viewpoint moves forward along the railway.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays train tracks centrally extending into the distance, flanked by vibrant green grassy fields. Rolling green hills and mountains are visible in the mid-ground and background, with a cluster of trees on a left-side hill. A cloudy sky occupies the upper frame. Overlaid are a speedometer (88 KPH) bottom-left, an elevation graph top-left, and digital readouts (0.4 km, 732 m altitude) bottom-right.
end of description
The viewpoint advances along the tracks, as indicated by the speedometer increasing to 90 KPH and altitude decreasing to 731m. A white marker to the left of the tracks approaches and passes the viewer's left side. A tall grey utility pole, supporting overhead wires, then emerges from the right side of the tracks in the mid-ground and moves progressively closer to the viewer.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows train tracks extending centrally into the distance, curving slightly right, flanked by bright green grassy fields under a cloudy sky. To the viewer's left, a gentle hill features several bare-branched trees, while to the right, a distant, darker green wooded mountain range and a utility pole with overhead wires are visible. A speedometer showing 90 KPH is in the bottom left, and distance/altitude data (0.4 km, 731m) is in the bottom right.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the surrounding landscape and tracks pass the viewer, with the speed varying between 89-90 KPH and the displayed distance increasing to 0.5 km. A white rectangular sign marked with '2' appears from the distant left side of the tracks, approaching and then passing, followed by a small orange ground marker also revealing itself on the left.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts railway tracks extending forward and curving gently to the right, observed from a viewpoint directly above them. To the left, a grassy hillside slopes upwards, featuring a prominent tree with nascent leaves and an orange marker on the lower embankment. To the right, a flat green field stretches towards distant forested mountains under a cloudy sky. Overhead catenary lines are visible, along with on-screen displays for speed (89 KPH) in the bottom-left and distance/altitude data in the bottom-right.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the orange marker on the left slope passes the viewer, and a wooden picnic table with benches becomes visible further up the embankment to the viewer's left. Concurrently, a grey utility pole supporting the overhead lines emerges from the distance on the right side of the tracks. A small, rectangular grey building also appears on the left side of the tracks, behind where the orange marker was. Both the utility pole and the building progressively approach and begin to pass the viewer as the scene advances.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a view down railroad tracks extending forward and curving slightly right, bordered by gravel, with a grey utility box immediately to the left and a tall catenary mast to the right, supporting overhead wires. Green, grassy hills with scattered trees flank both sides, leading to distant mountains under a cloudy sky, with a speedometer showing 89 KPH and other data overlays.
end of description.
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the initial utility box and catenary mast recede out of view to the immediate left and right, respectively. New catenary masts emerge from the distance, continually approaching the viewer. The surrounding green landscape dynamically shifts past as the train proceeds through the valley, with the speed increasing to 90 KPH in the final frame.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The viewer's perspective is centered on railway tracks extending into the distance, flanked by lush green grassy hillsides and distant treed mountains under a cloudy sky. Overhead catenary wires are visible, supported by a concrete pole on the right midground. A speedometer indicating 90 KPH, along with altitude and distance data, are overlaid in the bottom corners, and a blue line graph is in the top left.
end of description
As the train moves forward, the speedometer briefly drops from 90 KPH to 89 KPH before returning to 90 KPH, while the altitude decreases slightly and distance increases. Objects on the trackside, like a small brown post initially on the left midground and a concrete pole on the right, approach and pass the viewer. New marker posts emerge into view from the distant midground: a blue-grey one on the left and an orange one on the right, both progressively moving towards the foreground of their respective sides.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows the viewer positioned directly over train tracks, which recede into the distance, gently curving towards the right. Lush green fields flank both sides, rising into tree-covered hills and distant mountains under a partly cloudy sky. Overhead lines span across the frame, supported by a prominent grey pole on the right near a small red marker stake, while digital overlays indicate a speed of 90 km/h and an altitude of 729m.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, causing the red marker stake on the right to pass out of view and the large grey pole to draw nearer. The landscape continuously shifts, revealing more of the curving path ahead and bringing a cluster of dark green trees on the left hillside into clearer focus. The altitude subtly decreases to 728m as the train maintains a consistent speed around 90 km/h through the verdant valley.
