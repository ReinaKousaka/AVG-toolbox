The first frame captures a vibrant city street corner with a prominent crosswalk striped across the foreground. To the left, a yellow school bus, a white bus, and a yellow taxi are seen on the street, backed by a row of residential buildings. Centrally, a tall street pole with 'Lexington' and 'One Way' signs stands, while to the right, 'Sam's Famous PIZZA 1962' is displayed on a corner building with a red awning, fronted by several black garbage bags and a partial 'Subway' sign. Pedestrians are actively crossing the street, with individuals on the crosswalk moving from the left towards the viewer's right.

Over the subsequent frames, the group of pedestrians on the crosswalk continues to move from left to right, eventually exiting the frame towards the viewer's right. As they depart, a green trash can previously obscured by pedestrians becomes fully visible to the left of the center street pole, and more of the 'Subway' entrance sign on the far right sidewalk is revealed. Concurrently, a new pedestrian in a light blue dress and mask enters the crosswalk from the far left, also proceeding rightwards. More people appear and congregate on the sidewalk to the right, behind the initial group, and a person in a yellow vest becomes visible near the garbage bags on the right.

The first frame captures a sunlit city street corner with a crosswalk spanning the foreground. To the right on the sidewalk, a stack of black trash bags is visible next to "Sam's Famous PIZZA," which has a red awning; several people stand near the storefront, and more trash bags are piled close to its entrance. On the left side of the sidewalk, a green public trash can stands beside a street pole displaying "ONE WAY" and "Lexington" signs, with a group of people gathered further down the sidewalk. In the street to the left, a yellow school bus and a yellow taxi are seen moving away from the viewer.

Throughout the following frames, the yellow school bus and taxi on the street to the left continue to move further away from the viewer. On the sidewalk near Sam's Pizza, individuals who were initially bending over stand up and walk further to the right, and new pedestrians appear walking towards and away from the viewer. On the far left, a person previously obscured by the street pole becomes more visible as they walk towards the left edge of the frame. The central group of people on the sidewalk subtly shifts their positions and gestures.

In the first frame, a black pole with a yellow traffic light and a green public trash bin are visible on the left foreground, accompanied by black garbage bags and a tall, dark grey digital kiosk. To the midground left, a street contains a yellow taxi and other cars, while a diverse group of pedestrians occupies the midground center and right on a sunny city sidewalk. On the midground right, a storefront with a red awning and a "Sam's" sign is visible, with more people standing in front of it, and banners are strung across the street further in the background.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint slightly advances and pans right along the sidewalk. The digital kiosk on the left updates its displayed content, while the group of people initially gathered in the mid-right disperses and moves further into the background. Two women, one in a plaid shirt and another in a white shirt carrying a large blue bag, walk past the viewer towards the background right. Finally, a man is revealed sitting on the ground to the far right of the initial viewpoint, beside a red target bag near the storefront.
