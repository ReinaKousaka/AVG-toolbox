The first frame shows a dark, snowy city street scene at night. Snow covers the ground, with a large pile of snow prominently on the right, nearer to the viewer. To the immediate right, a grey utility box or poster stand with posters is partially visible. A large, reflective glass building extends along the left side of the frame, with people walking on the sidewalk further ahead. In the midground, a tall, conical light display hangs above the street, flanked by spherical string lights extending into the distance above the street. To the far right, a street with a yellow tram and more buildings adorned with lights are visible.

The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the snow-covered path. The grey utility box on the immediate right shifts further to the right and eventually out of frame. As it recedes, two red-and-white striped bollards are progressively revealed behind it, also moving towards the right. The prominent vertical light display and its supporting sign, initially in the midground, draw closer to the viewer and subtly shift left. The large snow pile on the right recedes, and more of the path and buildings ahead become visible.

Across subsequent frames, this person continues walking away from the viewer, progressively moving further into the background and shifting towards the left side of the scene. They eventually exit the frame to the far left, while the overall street scene remains static.
