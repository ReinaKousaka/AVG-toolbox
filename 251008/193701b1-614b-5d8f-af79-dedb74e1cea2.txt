The first frame captures a city street scene at twilight, with a wet asphalt road showing reflections of bright lights. On the immediate right, a concrete sidewalk is covered by a well-lit scaffolding structure, beneath which pedestrians walk away from the viewer, bordered by blue construction barriers. In the midground, a white SUV is stopped near a crosswalk on the left side of the street, while a street light pole with a 'SOUTH WATER ST' sign and a red traffic light stands to the right. A large, blank blue billboard is mounted above the scaffolding on the upper right, and in the background, numerous tall city buildings, illuminated by interior lights, line the street under a dark blue sky.

As the sequence progresses, the camera slowly pans right, revealing more of the street and buildings extending further down the block. The traffic light on the right changes from red to green, allowing vehicles to proceed. A dark SUV drives past the white SUV, followed by a maroon SUV entering from the left and a dark sedan, all moving away from the viewer along the street. Simultaneously, pedestrians continue walking away along the covered sidewalk.

The first frame presents a wet city street at dusk, viewed from a sidewalk with scaffolding on the immediate right. A crosswalk spans the lower left foreground, leading to a street featuring a prominent white SUV, other vehicles, a central green traffic light, and an "E South Water St" sign. Tall, illuminated buildings line both sides of the street under a dark blue sky, with some construction visible to the left and an elevated structure supported by scaffolding extending along the right side.

As the frames progress, vehicles on the wet street begin to move; a silver car drives away on the left, followed by the initial white SUV and another dark vehicle. Subsequently, a new white luxury SUV emerges from the left foreground, behind the first white SUV, and proceeds to drive past it away from the viewer.
