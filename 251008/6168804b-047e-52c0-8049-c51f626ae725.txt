The first frame shows a road extending forward, flanked by grey concrete walls and trees on both sides, with a white house visible to the far left behind a fence and a large mountain range dominating the distant background under a light sky. end of description. As the viewer advances, the foreground trees and walls recede to the sides, progressively revealing more of the side road branching left and a tall lamppost and a house on the right, which were initially partially obscured. A blue directional sign with white text eventually emerges on the right side of the road, further down from the initial viewpoint, as the overall scene opens up.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows the viewer on a road with white dashed lane markings extending into the distance. To the left, a sidewalk abuts a dark concrete retaining wall, beyond which stands a white house amidst green foliage, all framed by a massive, craggy mountain face in the background. To the right, a sidewalk borders a lighter concrete wall, with dense green trees and a blue directional sign on a pole visible.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the blue directional sign and street pole on the right recede out of view. The lighter concrete wall on the right extends further into the scene, while the dark concrete wall on the left also becomes more prominent. The white house on the left appears to recede slightly as the viewer passes it, and a small white car in the distance on the road becomes more distinct.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a two-lane road ahead, marked with white lines, flanked by concrete walls topped with green foliage, with a massive, rugged mountain range rising steeply in the background. A distant white car with headlights on is visible on the road, while scattered buildings are nestled at the mountain's base. end of description. As the viewpoint progresses forward along the road, the concrete walls on both sides recede. A red car parked to the right and a white building behind it become visible where the right wall terminates, with additional parked cars and buildings emerging further ahead on both sides. The white car, initially ahead in the first frame, steadily approaches.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures a view down a road leading to an intersection, flanked by buildings and mountains. In the immediate foreground, a grey asphalt road with white lane markings stretches ahead, with a black car approaching on the left lane and a red car partially visible, parked on the far right next to a street lamp. To the left, a concrete wall borders a reddish-brown building and a white house; to the right, a multi-story building and additional parked cars are visible, while imposing grey-green mountains rise dramatically in the background.
end of description
The black car continues to move past the viewer, proceeding to the left side of the frame. Subsequently, the viewpoint advances forward along the road, revealing a pedestrian crossing marked with yellow stripes and bollards. A blue pedestrian crossing sign appears in the center of the road, and a large blue billboard becomes fully visible on the right, further ahead. The camera continues moving forward, passing the initial intersection and revealing more of the road ahead and the details around the pedestrian crossing.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a wide road with yellow zebra crossing stripes and a raised island featuring black and yellow bollards in the foreground. To the left, a white building with green shutters and a white van are visible, while a bus stop, a blue billboard, and a dark car are positioned on the right, all beneath a massive, tree-covered mountain range dominating the background. A blue pedestrian crossing sign is centered above the island.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward, causing the pedestrian crossing sign to shift right and upward relative to the first-frame viewpoint. A motorcyclist, initially a distant figure ahead on the road, approaches the viewer, passing to the left of the original viewpoint and out of frame. The bus stop and billboard recede out of view to the right, revealing more of the adjacent building and a new lamp post in the mid-distance to the right of the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a paved road extends forward from the viewer, featuring a solid white line on the left and dashed white lines on the right, curving slightly into the distance. To the immediate left stands a multi-story building with green shutters, partially hidden by lush trees and bushes, while further down on the left, additional buildings and parked cars are visible. On the right, a metal railing borders the road, behind which multiple multi-story buildings and a tall lamppost are positioned. Dominating the background is a vast, steep mountain range, with a clear blue sky above.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing immediate roadside elements on both sides to shift towards the bottom and sides of the frame. A white car, initially visible further down the road on the left side of the curve, becomes more clearly defined as the viewer approaches its position. Additionally, a yellow sign or object emerges and becomes progressively clearer on the far right, appearing from behind the tall lamppost and moving further into the frame.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a road stretching into the distance from the viewer's perspective, marked with white lines and flanked by metal bridge railings on both sides. A white car is visible ahead on the road, with multiple buildings and lush green trees situated to its left and right. In the far background, towering rocky mountains dominate the upper half of the scene under a light sky.
end of description
The white car on the road ahead approaches the viewer, then passes, moving towards the left side of the frame relative to the initial viewpoint. Subsequently, a dark car, previously further in the distance, also approaches from the center of the road. As the viewer progresses, parked vehicles and additional buildings on the left side become more clearly visible.
