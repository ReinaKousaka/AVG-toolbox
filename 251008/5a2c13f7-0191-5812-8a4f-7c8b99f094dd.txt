The first frame shows a wet urban street with a prominent yellow and white crosswalk in the foreground. To the left, a silver car is parked in front of multiple shops, while a brick building and a slanting pole occupy the right side. In the midground, the street recedes towards a small yellow-roofed structure amidst greenery, with tall buildings visible in the distant background under an overcast sky.

Throughout the subsequent frames, subtle movement is noticeable in the tree leaves on the right side of the street, suggesting wind. In the latter half of the sequence, a person holding a black umbrella appears on the right sidewalk, in the midground, walking away from the viewer towards the background.

First, a wet asphalt street with double yellow lines on the left and a single yellow line bordering a sidewalk on the right stretches away from the viewer. A silver car is parked on the left curb, in front of a row of brick buildings housing shops, while a reddish-brown brick building stands immediately to the viewer's right. Further down the right side, a concrete sidewalk runs alongside a low wall with green bushes and trees, beyond which tall buildings rise in the background under a grey sky. A lone pedestrian, holding a dark umbrella, is seen walking away from the viewer in the mid-ground, towards the center of the street.

In the subsequent frames, the pedestrian continues to move further away from the viewer, progressing steadily down the wet street.
