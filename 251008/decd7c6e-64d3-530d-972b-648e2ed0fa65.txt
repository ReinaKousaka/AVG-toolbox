The first frame captures a vibrant city street scene under a clear blue sky. In the immediate foreground, the top of a black car is visible at the bottom-center, and the front of a white car occupies the bottom-right. A person in a high-visibility vest walks towards the viewer from the bottom-center right. To the left of center, a tall street light pole with multiple parking and traffic signs stands, beyond which a busy street recedes into the distance lined with buildings and moving vehicles. Centered slightly to the right and further down the street, a large brick building features an H&M billboard depicting two people, with a smaller light-yellow building directly below it. To the far right, a dark, ornate building facade with large windows is visible.
end of description
The camera slowly pans to the right while subtly zooming out, gradually expanding the visible scene. This reveals more of the ornate building, previously at the right edge, further to the viewer's right. Concurrently, more of the street and buildings extending away to the viewer's left become visible. The person in the high-visibility vest moves forward and slightly to the viewer's right, eventually exiting the frame. Additionally, the white car, initially at the bottom-right, moves slightly forward.
