The first frame displays a panoramic mountainous landscape under a clear blue sky. A dark metal railing occupies the bottom-left foreground, running diagonally upwards and bordering a light-colored building partially visible to its left, adorned with greenery and a high-mounted satellite dish. Beyond the railing, a lush green hillside descends into a valley, with several trees in the midground. The background features a large, barren mountain with a winding road, flanked by another heavily forested mountain to its right, and fainter blue mountains in the distant horizon.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly pans right, revealing more of the paved terrace and building previously to the viewer's left. A terracotta pot with plants appears directly left of the railing, followed by a window with blue shutters on the building. Further left and back, additional potted plants and a small yellow-and-white checkered table with chairs become visible on the terrace. The building's facade, including a doorway, is increasingly unveiled to the left of the original framing. Throughout, the distant mountains and green valleys shift rightward within the frame, maintaining their spatial positions relative to the overall landscape.
