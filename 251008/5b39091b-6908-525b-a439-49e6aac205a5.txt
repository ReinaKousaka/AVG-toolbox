The first frame depicts a wet urban street with buildings lining both sides under an overcast sky. In the immediate foreground to the left is an orange traffic cone, next to a yellow road marking. A white Kia car is parked on the mid-left side of the road, and behind it, a red vending machine stands against a building. On the mid-right, a red car is parked in a marked space, followed by a white SUV and a truck further down the street. Buildings with various signs recede into the background on both sides of the street.

The white Kia car, initially parked in the mid-left of the first frame, begins to move forward along the wet road, traveling away from the viewer. It continues to drive straight down the street, maintaining its position on the left side of the road relative to the viewer. This movement causes the car to appear progressively smaller and further into the mid-distance and background in subsequent frames. No other significant dynamic changes or newly revealed objects are observed.

The viewer is positioned on a wet, urban street, looking forward into a street lined with buildings and parked vehicles under an overcast sky. To the immediate left, a white Kia Picanto with 'kt service' branding is parked, and further down, buildings with signs and several parked cars, including a dark pickup truck, are visible. To the right, a red hatchback is partially seen in the foreground, parked near a pink-marked curb, behind which a dark pickup truck carries a white car covered by a tarp, alongside more vehicles.

As frames progress, rain begins to fall, creating visible splashes on the wet street surface directly in front of the viewer and extending into the distance. An orange traffic cone is newly revealed on the left side of the street, positioned near the dark pickup truck. The rain intensity appears to slightly increase throughout the sequence, impacting the same areas of the scene.

The first frame depicts a wet urban street on a rainy day, with a glistening asphalt road extending into the distance. On the left side, a grey pickup truck is parked closest to the viewer, next to a building displaying a large yellow sign with Korean text, followed by smaller vehicles and more buildings further down the street. On the right, a white pickup truck covered with a green tarp is parked in a designated lane marked with pink lines, behind which are a dark blue sedan, a silver SUV/van, and a white SUV, all static. In the background, numerous buildings and signs line both sides of the street under an overcast sky.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the grey pickup truck on the viewer's left side of the street begins to move forward, slowly advancing from its initial parked position. It proceeds further along the road, moving closer to the viewer and eventually passes the original first-frame viewpoint towards the left foreground. No other visible objects or scenes demonstrate dynamic changes or are newly revealed relative to the initial viewpoint.
