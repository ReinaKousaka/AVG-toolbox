The first frame displays a vibrant nighttime street scene, featuring a brightly illuminated food stall on the right and in the center. Above the stall, several large backlit menu boards showcase various food items such as dumplings, fried chicken, and buns. Steam is visibly rising from the stall in the mid-ground, where a crowd of people is gathered, facing the vendors. In the immediate foreground, the backs of people's heads and shoulders are prominent, with a person wearing glasses positioned to the viewer's left and another person with a red garment partially visible on the far left. The left side of the frame reveals a busy street receding into the background, lit by numerous neon signs featuring Japanese text and decorative red lanterns.

Over the subsequent frames, the plume of steam rising from the mid-ground food stall subtly fluctuates in shape and intensity. The person in the foreground to the viewer's left, wearing glasses, brings their hand closer to their mouth, appearing to eat. Concurrently, a woman at the stall in the mid-ground slightly to the right moves her arm downwards after seeming to interact with a vendor. Additionally, pedestrians further along the street in the left background continue to move, animating the overall scene.

The first frame captures a vibrant night street scene centered on a food stall.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the most prominent dynamic change is the steam emanating from behind the food stall's counter, which fluctuates in density and volume. People standing in the midground directly in front of the stall, as well as those walking along the street to the viewer's left, exhibit subtle shifts in their positions and head orientations. The bright illumination from the food display boards and distant street signs remains consistently vibrant.
