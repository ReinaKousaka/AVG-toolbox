More details of the shops on both sides, including the "GRAMI" ice cream shop and the restaurant on the left, become visible and closer to the viewer. Consequently, the previously obscured sections of the street ahead are revealed as the scene progresses.

The people initially in the foreground, including the woman in the black coat on the far right and the man in the dark green jacket, continue moving away from the first-frame viewpoint into the distance. The pair walking towards the viewer on the left in the first frame pass by, moving to the left and eventually behind the initial viewpoint. A woman in a vibrant green coat, originally in the midground, steadily approaches the first-frame viewpoint, becoming a central figure before passing it to the left. As the perspective subtly advances forward, more pedestrians previously obscured further down the street become visible in the midground, navigating the busy pathway. The storefronts and numerous signs lining both sides of the street largely retain their positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint, with new segments of the street continuously revealed further ahead.
