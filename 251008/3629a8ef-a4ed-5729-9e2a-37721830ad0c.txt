The first frame depicts a rainy night scene on a city street. To the viewer's immediate left, a dark railing borders a storefront with bright white and rectangular signs displaying Korean text, with blue and white containers below its window. The wet, tiled sidewalk extends from the foreground into the distance on the left. In the midground, several bicycles are parked in a rack on the right side of the sidewalk, next to a streetlamp and a dark trash bin. Further right and slightly closer, two large, lime-green bags rest near the base of a tree. Across the street, a wet road reflects the numerous overhead streetlights and building lights, with a black car visible moving away from the viewer in the distance.

In the following frames, the rain continues to fall consistently across the scene. The black car on the wet street, moving away from the viewer in the background, gradually proceeds further down the road, and a red car appears behind it, also moving away. Critically, the main traffic light positioned in the mid-background to the right of the street, which initially appears off or green, transitions to a clear red light around the fourth frame, intensely reflecting onto the wet pavement. This change in the traffic light persists for the remainder of the frames.

The first frame displays a rainy city street at night. To the viewer's immediate right, a cluster of bicycles is parked. Extending from the mid-ground to the background on the right, a wet multi-lane road is lined by streetlights and distant buildings with illuminated windows, with a utility pole holding traffic signals and street signs positioned in the mid-ground. On the viewer's left, a wet sidewalk parallels a building housing a storefront with a bright circular white light, a red 'Gong cha' sign, and blue crates with white containers near the bottom left. The entire scene is reflective due to the rain, with a prominent red light reflection on the wet sidewalk and road originating from a traffic signal in the mid-ground.

The prominent traffic light in the mid-ground, initially red, transitions to green by the fourth frame, altering the reflections on the wet ground from red to predominantly green. Concurrently, a few light-colored trash bags emerge on the right, beside the utility pole, starting from the third frame. Additionally, a long white object, possibly a fallen barrier, appears on the sidewalk to the left of the storefront in the fifth frame and remains visible.

A rainy night scene shows a wet brick sidewalk and crosswalk in the foreground. To the viewer's left, a building with "Gong cha" and coffee cup signs has a red awning; a black bin and white barrier are at its base. To the right, a traffic light pole stands, while beyond the crosswalk, the wet street extends into the distance with vehicle lights and reflections, all under a dark, misty sky.
end of description
The traffic light above the crosswalk, positioned to the left of the viewer's central line, dynamically changes from red to green. Correspondingly, the vibrant red reflections on the wet crosswalk and street fade and are replaced by bright green reflections. A tall, thin light pole further down the street on the left illuminates with a changing green, then purple glow, casting new reflections onto the wet pavement.
