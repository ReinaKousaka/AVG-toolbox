A nighttime urban street scene, made slick by rain, extends into the distance from the viewer's low vantage point. On the immediate right, a wet sidewalk with yellow tactile paving leads past a teal-colored building facade with a white circular light and Korean signage. Further along this sidewalk, a group of people holding umbrellas walks away from the viewer; two prominent figures in the midground are a person in a black shirt and another in a white shirt, both under dark umbrellas, with another person under a light blue umbrella slightly behind them. The wide street to the left of the sidewalk is highly reflective, showing streaks of light from distant vehicles and streetlights, with tall buildings dimly visible on both sides in the background.

The group of people with umbrellas on the right sidewalk dynamically moves further away from the viewer, receding into the midground as they continue walking down the street. The reflections on the wet road surface subtly shift and change as distant vehicles and streetlights cast varying glows, though no new objects or scenes are revealed. The overall environment of the rainy night street remains consistent in its appearance.

The scene shows a rainy city street at night from a low-angle viewpoint on a wet sidewalk. To the viewer's immediate right, a teal-colored building with multiple illuminated signs stands next to a group of five people holding umbrellas (black, white, and turquoise) on a sidewalk with yellow tactile paving. Straight ahead and to the left, a wide, wet asphalt street reflects the bright lights of distant vehicles, which are visible as blurred streaks in the midground. Tall, dark buildings rise in the background on both sides of the street, interspersed with trees.

The group of people on the sidewalk to the right of the viewer begins to move further along the street, spreading out and shifting slightly closer to the building. A new person holding an orange umbrella appears to the far right, closer to the building entrance and further from the viewer. Simultaneously, a white car, traveling on the street to the left of the initial group, approaches from the distance, passes in front of the viewer, and continues past the viewer's left side, followed by a darker vehicle.
