The first frame shows a bright city street scene from a ground-level perspective. To the left, a building with "FORUM" banners and large window displays lines the sidewalk, where several pedestrians walk away from the viewer. To the right, a tall black digital display totem stands next to a snow-covered verge, beyond which are bare trees and a street with a dark vehicle.

In subsequent frames, the content on the digital display to the right dynamically changes, transitioning from abstract and landscape-like images to an advertisement featuring an American Express credit card. This American Express ad then scrolls off the screen to the right, briefly revealing more of the street and buildings previously obscured by the display's reflective surface.

The first frame captures a city street view on a bright day, featuring a sidewalk on the left lined with multi-story buildings displaying "FORUM" banners, and a snow-covered verge and a wide street on the right with a large bare-branched tree in the mid-ground. Several pedestrians walk away from the viewer down the sidewalk in the center, while a colorful building mural is visible on the far right background, partially obscured by other buildings and scaffolding.
end of description
As the frames progress, a person's upper body and a white bag, initially seen partially in the bottom-left foreground, move past the viewer towards the mid-left, obscuring more of the sidewalk and the closest building facade. Simultaneously, the group of pedestrians in the center mid-ground continues walking away, becoming slightly smaller as the viewer's perspective advances subtly down the street. The distant background, including the mural and surrounding buildings, gradually appears closer.

The first frame presents a winter street scene from a first-person perspective, with the viewer's left shoulder, arm, and a pink cross-body bag prominent in the foreground. A dark, wet sidewalk extends into the midground, occupied by several pedestrians walking away, past a row of shop-lined buildings displaying a "FORUM" banner. To the right, a bare-branched tree stands beside a snow-covered verge, beyond which a street with distant buildings and a large colorful billboard appears under a bright blue sky.
end of description
As the viewer walks forward, the pedestrians ahead continue to recede into the distance, and the buildings on both sides appear to get closer and pass by. New sections of the icy sidewalk and the distant city architecture are progressively revealed ahead of the viewer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a woman in a dark coat with a pink shoulder bag walks away from the viewer on a paved sidewalk to the left, alongside buildings housing shops like 'Fuku Sushi' and 'Classic Pizza Restaurant'. To the right, a snowy street stretches forward, bordered by bare trees and distant city buildings under a bright blue sky, with a large dark tree trunk partially visible on the extreme right foreground.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera moves forward, causing the foreground woman to recede further into the distance on the left. A light grey parking meter is progressively revealed from behind the large tree trunk on the viewer's right, moving into the frame and becoming more central. The entire street scene, including other pedestrians ahead, gradually appears closer and more detailed from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a winter street scene. In the immediate foreground to the left, a woman wearing a dark coat and carrying a pink bag walks away from the viewer on a wet sidewalk. To her left are buildings housing shops like "Fuku. Sushi" and "Classic Pizza Restaurant." A snow-covered bank borders the right side of the sidewalk, behind which are bare trees, a streetlight, and a large grey utility box partially visible in the mid-ground right. Farther back, several buildings rise under a clear blue sky, with a prominent colorful billboard on one building to the far right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily moves forward. The woman initially in the foreground continues walking away from the viewer and gradually exits the frame to the left. Simultaneously, the grey utility box on the right moves out of view, revealing more of the snow-covered street and distant structures previously behind it. Towards the final frames, a new pedestrian pushing a pink stroller enters from the left mid-frame, moving along the sidewalk.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows the viewer on a snowy urban sidewalk, with multiple pedestrians walking away and towards them on the left, alongside buildings including a "Classic Pizza Restaurant." To the right, a snow-covered area features bicycle racks, a street, and a large building with a colorful mural, while bare trees and streetlights line the path under a clear blue sky.
end of description
A man pushing a purple baby stroller moves from the mid-left towards and past the viewer's immediate left, exiting the scene by frame three. Subsequently, a man in a dark vest and white shirt walks towards the viewer from the mid-left, passing the viewer by frame seven. Finally, another woman in a white hat and patterned scarf enters the far left of the frame, also walking towards the viewer, and continues to approach in the subsequent frames.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a winter city sidewalk scene, with a paved walkway on the viewer's left lined by storefronts, including "CLASSIC PIZZA" and a building with "FORUM" vertically displayed. Several pedestrians walk away from the viewer on this sidewalk, with a man in a dark jacket closest on the immediate left. To the viewer's right, a snow-covered path or street runs parallel, featuring bare trees, black poles, and silver U-shaped bike racks. In the midground and background, city buildings are visible under a clear blue sky, with a large green mural on a distant building and green construction barriers on the far right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves continuously forward along the sidewalk. People on the left side of the sidewalk move further away from the first-frame viewpoint or exit the frame to the left, while new individuals emerge from behind the first-frame viewpoint and enter the scene. The man initially in the foreground on the left moves progressively towards the left edge and out of sight. Objects on the right, like the snow, bike racks, and poles, also shift relative to the first-frame viewpoint, moving further left and slightly away, revealing more of the street ahead. The background buildings appear slightly closer as the camera advances through the scene.
