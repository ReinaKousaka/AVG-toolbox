The first frame shows a rainy night street scene from a low vantage point, with a wet asphalt road filling the foreground, reflecting vibrant green traffic lights and streetlights. To the viewer's right, a yellow-lined curb separates the road from a tree-lined sidewalk. In the midground, a white car with illuminated headlights is partially visible in the left lane, moving forward, while a red car's taillights glow in the right lane; overhead, green traffic lights and a blue street sign are visible on the left.

The white car proceeds slightly forward in subsequent frames, while a dark minivan then enters the scene from the viewer's left, beginning to cross the foreground intersection. As the minivan moves across the intersection and away to the right, a person holding a black umbrella emerges onto the sidewalk, positioned to the right of the viewer behind a utility pole. The dark minivan continues its trajectory across the intersection and further into the distance to the right, while the person with the umbrella remains visible on the sidewalk.

The first frame shows a rainy night with a wet road leading away from the viewer, reflecting streetlights. On the right, a sidewalk features a street pole and a person holding a black umbrella; on the road, a black SUV with illuminated taillights moves away towards the left-center, past a zebra crossing, with trees and overhead signs in the background.
end of description
Throughout subsequent frames, the black SUV continues to recede further into the distance. A white car emerges from the far background on the left side of the road, advancing towards the viewer and across the zebra crossing. The person holding the umbrella on the right sidewalk remains largely in place but exhibits minor shifts in posture.
