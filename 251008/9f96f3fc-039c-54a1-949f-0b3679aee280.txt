The first frame shows a wet street under steady rain, with a grey car partially visible on the left side of the road, next to a tree-lined sidewalk with other parked vehicles. On the right, two black tires are stacked on the pavement with a red and white cone inserted, next to a metal grate leading into a building. Two white cars are driving in the mid-distance on the wet asphalt road.

As the frames progress, the rain continues, and the two white cars in the mid-distance move further away from the viewer. A yellow taxi appears from the background on the left side of the street, driving towards the viewer. Simultaneously, a person in a dark green coat walks away from the viewer on the right sidewalk. The red and white cone on the right subtly shifts, sinking deeper into the stacked tires.

The first frame depicts a rainy city street looking down a wet asphalt road. To the immediate right, a metal grate leads to a sidewalk featuring a small potted plant and storefronts, while two black tires with a red object are positioned near the viewer. On the left, a black fence borders a row of parked cars and green trees, with a yellow van driving in the mid-distance on the rain-slicked street.
end of description
Throughout the frames, the yellow van on the left side of the road drives forward, moving progressively closer to the viewer. Simultaneously, a person walking on the right-hand sidewalk proceeds further into the scene. A white truck, initially mostly obscured inside the garage on the far right, gradually becomes more visible as it appears to be parked or emerging from the storefront entrance.

The initial frame depicts a rainy urban street, with a wet asphalt road extending centrally into the distance, flanked by buildings on the right and trees/traffic on the left. In the immediate foreground on the right are a metal grate, a coiled white rope, and parts of a white truck and a red container, while a grey building with a blue sign and a potted plant stand further back. On the left side of the road, a yellow taxi is partially visible, and a white car with illuminated headlights is in the midground, moving away from the viewer, with other vehicles beyond it.
end of description
Over subsequent frames, the yellow taxi on the far left exits the scene to the viewer's left, while the white car on the road approaches and passes to the viewer's left. Simultaneously, the foreground objects on the right (truck part, red container, coiled rope) move out of view to the viewer's right, revealing a black doormat on the sidewalk and shifting the blue building sign more centrally into the frame.
