In the first frame, a woman in a striped jumpsuit faces a mottled brown vanity and integrated sink in the center-right, resting her hand upon it; a partial view of a toilet is to her left, while a large mirror reflecting a cameraman and towels hangs above the vanity.

The woman then turns to face the viewer, revealing a newly donned striped bolero jacket, as the viewpoint shifts slightly left, exposing more of the bathroom's interior. A full view of the toilet behind her is now visible on the far left, alongside a round porthole window with horizontal blinds and a white towel hanging on a rail, all previously obscured. Finally, she reaches toward the vanity, picking up a white object.
