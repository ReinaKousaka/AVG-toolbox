The first frame shows two railway tracks curving leftward from the foreground towards a tunnel entrance in the midground, flanked by a dark retaining wall with a '195 1km' sign on the left and trees with a lower wall on the right, all beneath overhead wires and a distant mountain supporting a town under a clear sky.

As the viewpoint progresses, the retaining wall and sign on the left, and the trees and right wall, recede to the sides and behind the initial viewpoint. New catenary poles and speed limit signs (red circle with '8' and a downward arrow) appear from the front, moving past on both sides of the track, as the perspective shifts slightly on the distant mountain and town.

The first frame displays a train track perspective, with two parallel sets of tracks extending forward and curving slightly to the right in the foreground and midground. To the immediate left, a steep, dark rock face or retaining wall rises, partially covered with vegetation, and an orange and white sign with a black '8' and a downward-right arrow is positioned in the lower left. Overhead, numerous catenary wires span across, supported by poles positioned along both sides of the tracks. In the distance, a sprawling town or city is visible at the foot of a prominent mountain peak slightly to the right of center, with other mountains extending further right, all under a clear sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the initial '8' sign and early catenary poles recede from view to the left. A small train briefly emerges on the right track in the distance before disappearing. The retaining wall on the left continues to unfold, while a large body of water, likely a lake, and more of the distant mountain range become increasingly visible to the right of the tracks. Further catenary poles appear, and graffiti becomes visible on a fence along the right as the scene progresses.
