In the first frame, a prominent, ornate multi-story building with a reddish-brown upper facade and a grey stone base stands in the center-midground, displaying a curved corner and numerous windows. To the immediate right in the foreground, a dark street pole with attached traffic lights showing a red signal, a green "9A West Side Hwy" sign, and yellow pedestrian signal boxes is visible. Further left, a modern grey skyscraper rises in the background, while a slightly shorter, older building is visible to the left-midground, and another reddish-brown skyscraper appears in the center-background; light snow falls throughout the scene.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the snowfall intensifies, with more snowflakes visibly falling across the scene and accumulating slightly on the right-foreground street sign and traffic lights. The camera subtly shifts its perspective, causing the central ornate building to appear marginally closer and more dominant within the frame by the final images.
