A gray asphalt road extends directly from the viewer into the distance, gently curving uphill. To the immediate left, a multi-story purple house with numerous windows stands, partially obscuring other houses behind it, with a wooden fence, green bushes, and a silver car parked next to it. To the immediate right, a white building with pink timber-framed sections rises, also multi-story, with a sidewalk and green bushes alongside the road. Further down the street on the right, a black car is parked, and a dark-leaved tree stands slightly in front of a street lamp. In the mid-ground, the street lamp is visible, and beyond it, more houses appear in the distance, including a light green building with a prominent turret. The sky above is partially cloudy with patches of blue.

The viewpoint steadily advances along the street, causing the purple house on the immediate left and the white-pink house on the immediate right to recede and move out of view to their respective sides. The silver car on the left and the black car on the right are passed, also moving out of frame. The dark-leaved tree and street lamp, initially in the mid-distance on the right, draw closer and are subsequently passed. As the viewer progresses forward, a second black car and a motorcycle become newly visible parked further down the street on the right side.

A paved road stretches from the viewer towards the horizon, flanked by a row of multi-story houses on the left (pink, light brown, yellow, brown) and a sidewalk on the right. A dark-leafed tree stands on the right, behind which a white SUV, a dark car, and a red motorcycle are parked, with a streetlamp above the tree. Distant mountains are faintly visible ahead under a cloudy sky.

The viewer moves forward along the street. The houses on the left become progressively closer and larger, revealing red shutters on the pink house and later a stone wall and fountain emerging on the near left. The tree on the right grows larger as the viewer approaches, then shifts further right and partially behind, eventually revealing a previously obscured white building to the right of its original position. The parked cars and motorcycle on the right move out of frame as the viewer passes them, demonstrating a clear forward progression.
