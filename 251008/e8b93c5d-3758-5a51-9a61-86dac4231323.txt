The first frame shows the viewer positioned at the beginning of a downward-sloping moving walkway, flanked by glass railings with illuminated strips, extending into the midground. To the immediate left, a white sign is mounted on a metal pole, near a visible set of stairs descending parallel to the walkway. The passage ahead features a high, paneled ceiling with recessed lighting and a central elongated light fixture, with the entire structure appearing as a modern, enclosed tunnel.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the moving walkway, descending into the passage. The initial foreground objects, like the sign and stairs on the left, recede and eventually disappear from view to the left. The tunnel's interior becomes progressively more visible, revealing its full length and the consistent modern design of the walls and ceiling as the viewer travels deeper into the structure.
