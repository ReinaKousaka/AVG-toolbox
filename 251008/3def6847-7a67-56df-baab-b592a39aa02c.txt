The first frame presents a silver car parked on the left foreground, partially obscuring a stone building with white windows. An ascending road stretches into the distance, flanked by rows of stone houses on the left and another building with a bare tree on the right, with two distant cars visible on the road under a clear blue sky.

The silver car slowly moves out of the frame towards the left, revealing more of the stone house's front door, a wall lamp, and potted plants previously hidden behind it, all remaining on the left side. Concurrently, a red car, initially far up the road, drives towards the viewer, passing from the mid-right to the right foreground before exiting the scene. As the red car approaches and departs, the dark car previously parked in the distance becomes more clearly visible, remaining far up the road ahead.

In the first frame, two bins, one brown and one grey with a blue lid, are positioned to the immediate left of the viewer, in front of a stone building with several windows that extends into the mid-ground. The road leads uphill into the distance, bordered by more stone buildings on the left and a grey-rendered building with a dark parked car on the right, all under a clear blue sky. end of description. As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road; the bins on the immediate left exit the frame, revealing more of the stone wall and overgrown foliage. A white van, previously partially obscured on the left in the mid-ground behind the stone wall, becomes fully visible as the entire street scene gradually recedes.

The first frame depicts a narrow village road winding uphill, flanked by traditional stone buildings under a pale blue sky. On the left, a stone building with a rustic wooden door and overgrown grass occupies the foreground, next to a low stone wall leading back towards a row of houses. To the right, another stone building and several parked cars line the street as it ascends into the distance, with a utility pole and overhead wires visible centrally.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses steadily forward along the road. The initial left foreground building and wooden door recede out of view as the stone wall passes by. A white camper van, initially partially obscured behind the wall on the mid-left, fully enters the scene and then moves past to the upper left. Concurrently, the parked cars on the right recede and exit the frame, revealing more of the continuous stone building facades.
