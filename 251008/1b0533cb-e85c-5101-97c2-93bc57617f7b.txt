The first frame depicts a wet, reflective urban street scene at night, with a paved sidewalk leading into the midground on the right. A dark pole with a blue pedestrian/bicycle sign is prominent in the foreground left, while a wet asphalt road with markings runs parallel, beyond which several cars are parked alongside trees and a brightly lit "HOLLYS" coffee shop with red doors on the right. end of description. Throughout the subsequent frames, the heavy rain visibly continues to fall, increasing reflections on the ground and cars. Concurrently, a white car progresses along the wet road, moving further away from the viewer on the left side of the scene.

The first frame depicts a wet street scene at night. In the foreground, a dark, reflective sidewalk stretches from right to left, featuring a circular pattern near the center. To the left, a street with visible lane markings holds a blue pedestrian and bicycle sign, and several parked cars (a small white car and a dark SUV) under a canopy of trees. On the right, a brightly lit building with large windows and a red door, partially displaying "HOLIDAY," illuminates the scene.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, heavy rain continues to fall, causing a dynamic increase in water flow along the sidewalk on the right, near the illuminated building. This flowing water accumulates, forming a more prominent, expanding stream that reflects the building's lights more intensely. Simultaneously, pooling water around the circular pattern on the central sidewalk also becomes slightly more defined, but no new objects appear relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

A wet city street at night is seen, with a reflective paved sidewalk extending from the foreground on the right and an asphalt road on the left. Parked cars, including a black SUV and a white car, are visible along the left curb under trees, while illuminated storefronts and more parked cars line the right side of the street, all under the glow of city lights.
end of description
No new objects or scenes are revealed in the subsequent frames; however, subtle shimmering of reflections on the wet road and sidewalk surfaces dynamically suggests ongoing or recent rain.
