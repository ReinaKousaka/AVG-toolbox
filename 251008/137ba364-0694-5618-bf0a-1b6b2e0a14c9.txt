The first frame shows an urban street intersection with multiple buildings and people. In the foreground, a person with a backpack stands facing away from the viewer, near a utility pole displaying "SW Stark St" and "SW Harvey Milk St" street signs. To the left of the foreground, a person on a bicycle is crossing the street. A black building with a large glass facade and outdoor dining occupies the mid-ground to the left, while to the right, a building with a green awning, labeled "Jake's," also features outdoor seating. In the background to the left, a large building displays a colorful mural of a reclining figure, with a construction crane visible above it. Numerous cars are parked or moving further down the streets extending into the background.

Following frames show the person in the foreground slowly stepping forward, moving past the utility pole and gradually obscuring more of the right side of the view as they walk towards the street. A black car, initially visible in the mid-ground street to the right of the person, begins to move forward across the intersection. The cyclist previously visible to the left moves out of frame.
