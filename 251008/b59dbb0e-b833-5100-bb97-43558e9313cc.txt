The first frame displays a city street viewed from a vehicle, lined by tall buildings under a bright sky. To the left, parked cars extend down the curb beneath multi-story residential buildings with balconies, while the right features a sidewalk with a 'smile direct club' sign, a person, a cyclist, and a green traffic light overhead for E 60 St, as several cars drive down the central road ahead.
end of description.
As subsequent frames progress, the 'smile direct club' sign on the right is replaced by scaffolding and a glowing pink sign, indicating the viewer's vehicle is moving forward. The traffic light overhead briefly transitions from green to yellow, then back to green, and further ahead on the right, a large 'OUPC' sign becomes visible on the building.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame presents a straight city street extending into the distance, flanked by tall multi-story buildings on both the left and right. Numerous cars are visible, with several driving away from the viewer in the central lanes and multiple vehicles parked along the left curb; a delivery cyclist is also seen riding away near the right sidewalk. The sky is bright and clear above the distant buildings, and leafless trees are scattered along the sidewalks.
end of description
Subsequent frames show a subtle forward progression of the viewpoint. The parked cars on the left gradually shift further left relative to the viewer's central path, while the street ahead subtly elongates and the buildings on either side appear to move slightly outwards, indicating the viewer's vehicle is advancing. The driving cars in front maintain their relative distance while also moving forward.

The first frame shows a multi-lane city street extending into the distance, flanked by tall buildings on both sides; several cars are ahead in the road, with some parked vehicles and a red bus-like structure to the far left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The vehicles previously ahead recede further, while the red structure on the far left gradually moves out of view to the left. New sections of the street and buildings appear ahead as the environment continuously shifts from foreground to background, maintaining the same relative viewpoint down the street. Pedestrians on the right sidewalk become more prominent, walking further along the path parallel to the viewer.

First, a wide urban street scene unfolds, looking down a long avenue lined by numerous multi-story buildings on both the viewer's left and right. The foreground shows an asphalt road with white markings, leading to multiple cars moving away in the midground, including a central gold SUV and a red SUV in the right lane, while sidewalks with bare trees, streetlights, and a pedestrian on the right flank the road.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's position remains static while the midground vehicles continue moving forward away from the viewer. A new dark SUV appears in the right lane, replacing the red one and also moving away, as a yellow taxi emerges from the far left of the viewer, moving towards the viewer into the bottom-left corner. The pedestrian on the right sidewalk continues to walk forward away from the viewer.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a city street extends into the distance, flanked by tall buildings. In the immediate foreground, a yellow taxi occupies the bottom left corner, with white crosswalk lines visible on the asphalt. Moving forward, several cars are visible in traffic lanes, led by a dark SUV in the central lane. On the left, a sidewalk with parked cars and pedestrians is covered by scaffolding, above which a green 'E 62 St' sign hangs. On the right, storefronts and pedestrians line another sidewalk, with an identical 'E 62 St' sign and a green traffic light overhead.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily advances down the street. The yellow taxi on the immediate left moves further into the frame, then begins to recede as the viewer's vehicle overtakes it. The white crosswalk lines slide beneath and behind the viewer's position. Objects further ahead, like the dark SUV, appear closer, while the buildings and sidewalks on both sides reveal new sections as the scene progresses forward.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a city street looking forward, with the rear of a yellow taxi van positioned to the viewer's immediate left, while a 'E 62 St' sign and a green traffic light hang above the left sidewalk, and numerous buildings line both sides of the street extending into the distance under a bright sky.
end of description
As frames progress, the viewer's viewpoint moves forward; the yellow taxi, street sign, and traffic light gradually exit the left side of the frame, revealing additional parked cars further down the street on the left. All vehicles ahead, and pedestrians on the right sidewalk, also move further into the distance relative to their initial positions.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A street scene unfolds directly ahead, featuring a prominent yellow van slightly right of center. Parked cars line the left, under scaffolding, while a lane of moving traffic and towering buildings recede into the distance on both sides beneath a pale sky.
end of description
The yellow van remains mostly stationary relative to the viewer. The dark SUV to its right, initially positioned slightly behind the yellow van's rear, progressively moves forward and slightly right, advancing past the van. Simultaneously, the illumination on the right-side buildings appears to intensify.
