frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a snowy, icy path leading slightly right of center towards a large, dark brown house with a snow-covered roof; to the immediate left, part of a brown building and snow-covered ground are visible, while a bright sun is low over snow-capped mountains in the background. A partially visible yellow building and frozen water are seen further right, and a transparent overlay shows speed, grade, and distance metrics.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the path, the initial left-side brown building moves out of frame, revealing a lamppost, a bare tree, and a signpost, along with more houses appearing further to the left of the original position. The large dark brown house on the right gradually moves closer and then exits the frame to the right, opening up the view to more distant snowy landscapes and buildings further back.

The first frame depicts a wide-angle view of a snow-covered village street on a bright winter day. An icy, partially cleared path extends from the viewer into the midground, flanked by deep snow banks. To the viewer's immediate left, a small bare tree branch protrudes, and further back, a light-colored house sits on a snowy incline, adjacent to another house with two garage doors. To the right, a darker-toned house is partially obscured by a bare tree, behind which a bright sun shines low in the sky, causing a lens flare. In the background, more houses are scattered among the snow, with snow-covered mountains towering to the right under a clear blue sky. A digital overlay in the top right corner shows "SPEED 12 KM/H", "GRADE -2%", "DISTANCE 1.2 KM", and a map.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the icy path, objects initially in the midground, like the houses and trees, shift closer and then recede towards the sides, eventually moving out of the frame as the viewer passes them. The bare tree on the right gradually moves to the left relative to the sun, revealing a red fire hydrant previously partially hidden by snow and branches, which then moves from the path's center to its right. A large shadow, initially on the far left of the path, lengthens, moves across the path, and then shortens as the viewpoint moves through it. Simultaneously, the "GRADE" value in the overlay dynamically updates from -2% to -1%, then to -0%, and eventually to +1%, reflecting the changing incline, while the map overlay consistently indicates forward movement along the route.

A snow-covered road extends from the viewer into the distance, flanked by snow banks. To the viewer's immediate left stands a beige garage with two brown doors, partially obscured by a street lamp pole directly in front of it, with a light-colored house perched on a snowy incline behind it. To the viewer's right, a dark brown house with prominent windows is visible, with a small bare tree in front and a red post at the far right edge. In the background, more snow-dusted houses and distant mountains rise under a clear blue sky, with the sun creating a glare in the upper right. Digital overlays indicating speed, grade, and distance, alongside a small map, are present in the top right corner.
end of description
The viewpoint advances along the snowy path. The street lamp pole on the left shifts further left, eventually revealing the full beige garage, while the red object on the right side exits the frame. As the viewer moves forward, more of the houses on both sides become visible, approaching the first-frame's midground. Tire tracks appear on the snow-covered section of the path to the viewer's left, and the digital distance overlay updates from 1.2 KM to 2 KM.
