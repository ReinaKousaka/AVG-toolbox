The first frame displays a wet, dark asphalt street under an overcast sky. In the foreground to the right, a red bicycle leans against a concrete barrier. A black sedan is positioned in the mid-ground, facing away from the viewer in the center of the road. To the left of the sedan, several cars are parked alongside a multi-story building featuring multiple businesses with Korean signage, including a prominent pink sign. The street recedes into the background, where more buildings and distant trees are visible.

In the subsequent frames, the black sedan dynamically moves further away from the viewer down the wet street. Its brake lights intermittently illuminate red and then dim as it continues its progression into the distance.

The first frame displays a wet asphalt street receding uphill into the distance, bordered by buildings under an overcast sky. To the left, a multi-story building with a large red and white sign features two white cars parked in a ground-level recess. Various shops with awnings line both sides of the street, while several cars are parked or slowly moving further down the road towards distant buildings and green trees.

In the following frames, a large red banner on the upper-left building slowly descends. This movement progressively reveals additional Korean text on the building's facade, specifying "Eunji Sikdang" and a phone number at the top, and "Clean Real Estate Agency" with another number directly beneath it. No other significant dynamic changes or newly revealed objects are observed.

In the first frame, a wet asphalt road, reflecting the overcast sky, stretches uphill into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings with various shops. To the viewer's left, two white cars are parked beneath a building with a red awning and multiple signs, while to the right, a black car is parked partially on the street next to a building with a similar awning and signs. Power lines traverse the upper sky, and distant tall buildings are visible in the background beyond the surrounding trees and closer structures.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, a white sedan, initially positioned in the mid-ground behind the black parked car on the right, begins moving forward, then turns right, proceeding further up the hill and away from the viewer. Following closely, a dark SUV also advances and turns right onto the ascending road, receding into the background. Simultaneously, a lighter-colored car positioned further up the hill continues its motion, gradually moving out of view in the distance.
