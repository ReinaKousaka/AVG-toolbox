Throughout the subsequent frames, the scene remains largely static, with the continuous rainfall being the prominent dynamic element, visible as streaks in the light and maintaining the reflective sheen on the wet street and sidewalks. No new objects are revealed, and all existing elements maintain their initial spatial positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame captures a rainy city street at night, with a wet road on the left reflecting streetlights and building signs, and a sidewalk on the right lined with parked bicycles and a large tree trunk. A prominent streetlamp stands in the left-center foreground, illuminating the heavy rainfall. A silver car with headlights on is on the street in the mid-left, and a white sedan is further to the left. end of description. In subsequent frames, the silver car moves further away from the viewer and eventually exits the frame to the left, while the white sedan also continues to move further down the street on the left.
