The initial frame displays a paved pedestrian walkway flanked by diverse shops: a teal-canopied store with displayed products on the left and a yellow-fronted shop with a patterned screen and A-frame sign on the right. In the midground, several pedestrians are visible on the path, with additional shopfronts and a distant mountain in the background.

Over the subsequent frames, the pedestrians move further down the walkway relative to the viewer's static position, notably the person in the black puffer jacket slightly turns and shifts left in the midground. The A-frame sign in the right foreground also subtly repositions, moving slightly inward towards the walkway's center, but no new scenes or objects are newly revealed.

In the first frame, the viewer looks down a pedestrian street bordered by shops. To the immediate left, a stall with a blue awning and displayed items is partially visible, with two people standing near it. Directly in front, slightly right of center, a person in a black puffer jacket stands with their back to the viewer. To the right, a brick-textured building displays a golden wing sculpture, with a sign board and flower planters on the sidewalk. Further ahead, a glass-fronted building stands on the left, opposite a smaller white kiosk to the right, under a large red billboard in the background, with several people walking in the midground.

As the camera moves forward and slightly right, the person in the black puffer jacket turns, moves left, and eventually exits the frame from the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, the 'TEA EXPERT' sign on the building to the right becomes fully visible as the camera advances. A green bench and a red mailbox are newly revealed on the left side of the street, previously obscured by the foreground stall. The street scene continues to unfold, showing more depth and previously hidden details from the initial perspective.
