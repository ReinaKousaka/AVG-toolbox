The first frame captures a wide urban sidewalk, paved with grey and patterned tiles, stretching into the distance from the foreground. To the left, a multi-story building featuring large windows and red and green signage is visible, with a small green tree partially obscuring its base. Two individuals stand near a light blue suitcase on the sidewalk in front of this building, towards the mid-left. To the right, a row of trees with lush green foliage and red lanterns lines a busy pedestrian path where several people are walking away from and towards the viewer. In the background, towering buildings ascend into a hazy sky, and parked cars are visible beyond the trees on the far right.

The subsequent frames show continuous movement on the sidewalk while the camera remains static. The two individuals near the blue suitcase on the mid-left stay largely in their position. People on the pedestrian path in the mid-right move further into the distance or appear closer, passing along the path. A person initially walking from the mid-left, past the stationary duo, continues their stroll towards the mid-right and out of view.

The first frame presents a bustling urban sidewalk scene extending from the viewer's foreground into the distance. To the viewer's left, a multi-story commercial building with red-framed windows and a prominent red-and-yellow sign stands, backed by a taller high-rise building. Two individuals, one with a light blue suitcase, are visible near this left building. Along the viewer's right, a line of green-leafed trees, some adorned with red lanterns, borders the sidewalk, with a street containing parked cars and distant buildings visible beyond them. Numerous pedestrians populate the midground sidewalk, moving away from the viewer under an overcast sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the pedestrians on the sidewalk continue their forward motion, progressively moving further away from the first-frame viewpoint. The individual walking left-to-right in the midground steadily advances across the scene. The two individuals near the left commercial building, close to the viewer, exhibit only minor shifts in their postures. All other elements, including buildings and parked cars along the distant street, remain static relative to the initial viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a wide urban pedestrian sidewalk leading into the mid-ground, flanked by buildings on the left and a tree-lined street on the right. On the left, a multi-story commercial building with signage stands, behind which a tall skyscraper is visible. To the right, a street with parked cars and a yellow taxi is shaded by trees adorned with red lanterns further down. Several pedestrians are scattered across the sidewalk, with a group of three, including one pulling a light blue suitcase, located in the mid-foreground on the left, and others populating the right side of the path.
end of description
The group of pedestrians on the left, including the one with the blue suitcase, steadily walks further away from the viewer, eventually exiting the frame to the left. Concurrently, other pedestrians on the right-hand sidewalk continue their movement down the street or closer to the viewer. A white car slowly moves from the mid-right of the street towards the foreground. The overall urban landscape, including the buildings, trees, and the yellow taxi, remains largely stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a wide urban sidewalk with a multi-story building featuring commercial signs and taller structures receding into the distance on the left, while a tree-lined street with parked and moving cars runs parallel on the right. Numerous pedestrians are scattered along the sidewalk, some moving towards and some away from the viewer, beneath an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera subtly shifts forward. Concurrently, a pair of individuals on the far left of the sidewalk walk away, moving further from the viewer's initial position and exiting the left side of the frame. Meanwhile, two women on the right sidewalk walk directly towards the viewer, passing by to the right, and distant vehicles on the street to the right also reposition.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a wide, patterned grey sidewalk in the foreground, bordered on the left by a multi-story commercial building adorned with numerous signs. To the right, a line of green trees with red banners partially obscures a road where a white car is visible, while tall grey buildings fill the background. Several pedestrians populate the sidewalk, with two women prominent in the mid-right foreground.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the two women from the mid-right walk past the viewer and move further towards the left side of the frame. An older woman in a floral top and dark pants, carrying a white bag, enters the scene from the far right, slowly walking directly towards the viewer and into the foreground. Other pedestrians continue their movement in the middle ground, maintaining their relative positions within the stable urban backdrop.
