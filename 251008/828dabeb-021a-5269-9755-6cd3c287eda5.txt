The first frame depicts a night cityscape along a street flanked by tall buildings. To the immediate right, a covered walkway supported by numerous white arched structures extends into the distance, with a blue parking sign and several potted plants visible on the sidewalk. A line of green potted plants divides the sidewalk from the street in the center, where a white van, a blue car, and several dark sedans are parked or moving on the left. Above the street, large illuminated billboards adorn buildings, with one prominent display reading "HAUNTED MANSION JULY 28." In the background, brightly lit skyscrapers recede under a dark sky.

The most significant dynamic change is observed on the large central-left digital billboard, which initially displays "HAUNTED MANSION JULY 28." Over subsequent frames, this billboard transitions through an animated purple and white graphic. It then reveals new text and imagery related to "Haunted Mansion," indicating a changing advertisement, before returning to a variation of the original ad.

The first frame presents a night-time city street flanked by tall buildings; a white van is positioned on the near left of the road, which is separated from a scaffolding-covered sidewalk on the right by a row of potted plants. In the midground, multiple large, illuminated billboards stand prominently, including a purple one displaying "HAUNTED MANSION" details, with distant city lights illuminating the dark sky.

Across the following frames, the most notable dynamic change occurs on the prominent purple billboard in the midground, which sequentially displays a 'Haunted Mansion' movie title, then a purple background with white fireworks, and finally a scene with movie characters. Additionally, the white van on the far left and other vehicles on the street exhibit subtle forward movement.

The first frame displays a vibrant city street at night, featuring tall buildings lining both sides; a white building with numerous windows and illuminated billboards, including a large "Haunted Mansion" ad, dominates the left, while the right reveals a sidewalk covered by a scaffolding structure. The street below is bustling with parked and moving cars, a central median with potted plants, all lit by streetlights and building lights against the dark night sky.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the camera subtly shifts left and zooms in slightly, capturing a more dynamic scene. Vehicles on the street, including a blue car on the left and a white van further left, begin to move forward from their initial positions. Towards the final frames, a cyclist appears from the bottom-left of the viewpoint, entering the scene and moving along the street.

To the right, a sidewalk with planters and construction scaffolding runs parallel, while a person on a bicycle is visible in the lower left foreground.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the person on the bicycle in the lower left foreground continues to move rightward, advancing further across the frame. Concurrently, the blue car in the mid-left subtly moves forward, and the digital billboard below 'Haunted Mansion' changes its illuminated display from an explosion scene to a purple-hued advertisement featuring what appears to be a stack of money.

The first frame depicts a vibrant city street at night, looking down a wide thoroughfare lined with buildings and illuminated billboards. A dark cargo tricycle is positioned on the street, slightly left of center, with a row of potted plants to its right along a pedestrian walkway. Cars traverse the street in the midground, while towering city buildings, bright advertisements like "HAUNTED MANSION," and distant rising steam fill the background.

end of description
As frames progress, the tricycle moves forward and slightly right relative to the initial viewpoint, while various vehicles on the street also advance forward. Concurrently, the content on some of the large digital billboards on the left side of the street changes, revealing new advertisements.

The first frame captures a vibrant city street scene at night. In the immediate foreground to the right, a row of potted plants, some with flowers, defines the edge of a sidewalk which continues into the midground where white barriers and a construction scaffolding structure are present. On the street in the midground, several dark cars and a pedicab are visible, with more traffic extending into the distance. To the left, a building houses storefronts like Macy's and Sunglass Hut, topped by a large black billboard displaying a blue and white logo. In the background, tall illuminated buildings rise under a dark sky, and a prominent purple digital billboard featuring "Disney's Haunted Mansion" with a release date is visible, positioned above a smaller billboard showing figures.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, significant changes occur on the digital billboards located in the background. From frames 3 through 5, the 'Haunted Mansion' advertisement and the billboard beneath it transition to blank white screens. By frame 6, the top billboard displays a light green advertisement for 'realtor' with text, and the lower billboard shows another light-colored ad with text and an image. Simultaneously, the cars and the pedicab in the midground on the street slowly progress forward relative to the viewer's fixed position.

The first frame displays a vibrant city street at night, featuring tall buildings illuminated by numerous digital billboards on both sides. In the foreground, a pedestrian island with lush green shrubs and flowers separates the viewer from the traffic lane, where multiple cars are parked or moving, and a pedicab is visible further down the middle. To the far right, a plume of steam rises from the street.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, cars and the pedicab progressively move forward along the street relative to the viewer, while the prominent digital billboards on the buildings dynamically change their advertisements. Concurrently, the steam on the far right dissipates and then re-emerges slightly further down the street.
