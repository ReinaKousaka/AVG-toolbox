In the first frame, a wet asphalt road stretches from directly in front of the viewer towards the middle distance, bordered on the left by a steep, lush green hillside and on the right by a metal guardrail. Ahead of the viewer, slightly to the right of the road's center, a grey truck is positioned before a dark tunnel entrance, which is situated directly ahead. In the background, beyond the tunnel and guardrail, more green foliage is visible, with misty, fog-obscured mountains far in the distance.
end of description
The grey truck ahead of the viewer gradually proceeds deeper into the dark tunnel entrance. Simultaneously, the viewer's vehicle moves forward along the wet road, approaching the tunnel. Periodically, a windshield wiper sweeps across the lower portion of the frame, momentarily appearing directly in front of the viewer.
