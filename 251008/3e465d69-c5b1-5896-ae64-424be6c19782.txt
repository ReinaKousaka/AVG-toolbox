The first frame displays a street view, with a reddish-brown building featuring "URBAN OUTFITTERS" signage and multiple display windows extending along the brick sidewalk to the viewer's left. To the viewer's right, an asphalt street with a yellow line holds a white pickup truck and a dark SUV parked further down. In the midground, a tall street light stands, with additional buildings and trees receding into the background on both sides of the street.

As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk. The Urban Outfitters building and the initially visible parked cars recede to the left and behind the original first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, new sections of the street and buildings further down are revealed in front of the first-frame viewpoint, including a white van appearing on the far right, closer than the previously parked vehicles.
