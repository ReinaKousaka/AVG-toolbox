In the first frame, two individuals are seen from behind in the foreground, positioned slightly to the left of the viewer's center, standing on a dry, earthy ground. Overhanging tree branches with green leaves frame the upper left, while branches with vibrant reddish-orange autumn leaves frame the upper right, both extending from large trees just beyond the foreground figures. In the midground, a wide open area is populated by several groups of people walking and gathered, leading to traditional Korean-style buildings with light walls and dark tiled roofs that stretch across the scene from left to right. Farther back, gentle hills covered in autumn foliage rise under a clear, bright sky.

In the subsequent frames, the group of people in the midground, slightly right of the foreground figures, becomes more active, with individuals turning their bodies and shifting positions as if conversing or observing their surroundings. One person within this group, initially facing left, rotates to face more towards the right midground before shifting back, while another steps slightly to the right. Simultaneously, a person previously seated on the stone structure to the far right stands up and begins to walk diagonally left into the open space. Minor shifts in position are also observable among other scattered individuals across the midground, creating a dynamic, populated scene.
