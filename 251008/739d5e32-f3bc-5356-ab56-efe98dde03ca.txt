The first frame depicts a sunny city street scene. In the immediate foreground on the right is a black trash can, while the left features a paved sidewalk with a small bird, a wooden bench, and a black metal fence. Along the street, a line of parked cars is visible, including a white SUV on the far right, a black sedan, a light-colored Jeep, and a dark SUV further down. Beyond the street, a row of urban buildings, mostly red brick with some white sections and fire escapes, lines the background, with taller structures visible in the distance on the far left.
end of description
A person on the far sidewalk, initially to the right of the light-colored Jeep, gradually moves rightward, slightly away from the viewer. The small bird on the foreground sidewalk briefly hops forward and then returns to its original position. Concurrently, the shadows cast across the street and parked cars subtly lengthen and shift towards the viewer's right.
