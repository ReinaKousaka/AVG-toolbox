In the first frame, a bright red sports car occupies the immediate foreground on the left, partially obscuring the sidewalk. To the viewer's right, a dark vertical structure with orange stripes stands, with cardboard boxes at its base. A white SUV is visible in the middle of the street, driving away from the viewer, while a yellow scooter is parked on the right sidewalk. Both sidewalks are lined with pedestrians and multi-story buildings displaying numerous illuminated signs under a dark night sky.

Subsequently, the red sports car in the immediate foreground gradually moves out of frame to the left, fully revealing the street and the left sidewalk. Simultaneously, the white SUV proceeds further away from the viewer down the street, while pedestrians continue to move along both sidewalks. The yellow scooter on the right sidewalk remains stationary throughout the sequence.
