The first frame displays an urban street scene looking forward, with a red brick wall and storefronts lining the right sidewalk, where black trash bags are also visible. On the left, a green tree, a white building, and a stationary white bus occupy the side of the street, while a red car is parked further down the middle lane, all under a backdrop of various city buildings and a tall modern structure in the distance.
end of description
Subsequent frames primarily introduce the white text "EAST 146th STREET" in the bottom left corner, appearing from the third frame and remaining throughout the sequence. Aside from this textual overlay, all other visible objects including the bus, red car, buildings, and general streetscape remain static in their original spatial positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame displays a city street scene from a sidewalk perspective, with a prominent red brick wall, trash bags, and a metal bin to the immediate right. Further down the right sidewalk are multiple buildings featuring storefronts and fire escapes, while on the street to the left, a white articulated bus is visible, followed by a red car, both heading away from the viewer amidst various background buildings.
end of description
Subsequently, the white bus on the left side of the street gradually moves forward, receding into the distance from the first-frame viewpoint. As the bus continues to advance, the red car previously positioned behind it becomes more fully visible and also proceeds further down the street, maintaining its path away from the viewer.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a street view shows a sidewalk extending from the foreground right into the midground. To the immediate right, a red brick wall is visible, with several black trash bags next to a silver bin positioned along its base. Along the right side of the street are various storefronts and white-sided buildings featuring fire escapes. On the left, a street runs parallel to the sidewalk, occupied by a white bus and a red car in the midground, both appearing stationary. A red street sign stands on a pole to the left of the sidewalk. In the background left, tall buildings with diverse facades rise above the street. The sky above is overcast.
end of description
There are no perceptible dynamic changes or newly revealed objects in the subsequent frames; all visible elements, including the bus, car, and trash bags, remain static in their original positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays an urban street scene looking forward, with a red brick wall, silver bins, and black trash bags in the right foreground, adjacent to a sidewalk extending into the distance. On the right, storefronts line a building, while the street on the left features a white bus, a red car, and distant tall buildings under an overcast sky, with a 'NO STANDING' sign on a pole mid-left.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the white bus on the street to the viewer's left gradually moves forward, receding further down the road, as does the red car positioned behind it.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a city street view with a sidewalk on the right, bordered by buildings, and a street on the left. Immediately to the viewer's right are metal bins and black garbage bags against a red brick wall, with a building featuring a white door and a "DELI GROCERY" sign further along. On the left, a black pole with a "NO STANDING" sign stands near a parked red SUV and a white and blue bus moving away in the distance, against a backdrop of tall buildings.
end of description
Across the following frames, the white and blue bus on the street slowly recedes further away from the viewer towards the background on the left. No other elements change dynamically within the scene.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a city street with a sidewalk on the right and a road on the left. To the right are buildings featuring a white door labeled '362' and several storefronts, mostly obscured by red security gates, topped by a "DELI GROCERY EL FOGON 2017" sign. On the street to the left, a red car is parked mid-frame with a bus further beyond it, while a shopping cart rests on the sidewalk closer to the viewer. In the far distance on the left, a tall modern building stands under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera slowly pans right, causing the shopping cart to gradually move out of view to the left. Concurrently, the deli storefront and the door numbered '362' on the right become more centrally positioned, revealing slightly more of the building's facade. The red car and bus on the street also incrementally advance forward from their initial positions to the left.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a street scene with a concrete sidewalk dominating the left and center foreground. An empty metal shopping cart is positioned on the sidewalk in the mid-left foreground, alongside the curb. To the left of the sidewalk, a red car and a white car are parked on the asphalt street, which recedes into the background towards a tall modern building. On the right, a row of older brick buildings features storefronts, some with red or black security gates, beneath a 'DELI GROCERY EL FOGON 2017' sign, with a colorful mural on the far right.

end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly pans slightly to the left, gradually revealing more of the street and additional buildings further down on the left side of the road that were initially just beyond the first-frame's left edge. Simultaneously, elements on the far right of the first frame, such as the edge of the colorful mural, progressively shift out of view. All other objects within the scene, including the shopping cart, parked cars, and buildings, remain static relative to each other.
