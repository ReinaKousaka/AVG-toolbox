The first frame shows a paved road curving slightly to the right, extending forward from the viewer, with a solid white line on the left and a silver guardrail on the right. To the viewer's left is a steep, tree-covered hillside, while a line of trees runs along the right side of the road, all under a blue sky with scattered clouds and a purple lens flare, with distant mountains visible centrally ahead. end of description. As the video progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the trees on both sides and the guardrail on the right to pass by towards the left and right edges, respectively, while the distant mountains gradually appear to approach in the forward view.
