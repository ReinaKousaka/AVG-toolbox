A street scene shows a paved sidewalk extending into the distance, flanked by a bare tree trunk on the left and a reflective brown wall topped with a green hedge on the right. A person in dark clothing walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk, while a street with parked cars and a building under construction on the far left completes the urban landscape.
end of description
As the frames progress, the walking person moves further away from the viewer along the sidewalk. Simultaneously, a dark SUV drives into view from the far distance on the street to the viewer's left, passing by towards the foreground. The walking person's reflection also moves along the right-side wall, mirroring their progression away from the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
In the first frame, a sidewalk extends from the viewer towards a city street ahead. To the viewer's left, a dark SUV is stopped on the street, and a bare-branched tree stands on the sidewalk. To the viewer's right, a reddish-brown granite wall topped with a green hedge runs parallel. A person in a black jacket and dark pants walks towards the viewer on the sidewalk, while a building under construction with green netting is visible in the background to the left, and distant mountains are further behind it.
end of description
As the frames progress, the person on the sidewalk walks closer towards the viewer, becoming larger in the frame. Concurrently, the dark SUV on the street moves forward slightly, advancing from its initial position to the left of the viewer. The shadow of a person, likely the viewer, on the granite wall to the right also shifts, indicating slight movement of the camera or viewer.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a city street scene. A man in a black and red jacket walks towards the viewer on a sidewalk, flanked by a reddish-brown stone wall to the immediate right and a bare-branched tree to the left. The street features a moving grey car on the left, parked vehicles further back, and traffic lights, with a green-netted construction building and distant hazy mountains in the background.
end of description
The man continues walking past the viewer, exiting the frame towards the left. Concurrently, a dark grey SUV proceeds forward on the street to the viewer's left, and a cyclist emerges from the mid-left of the street, riding across towards the mid-right.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a street view with a grey sidewalk extending from the foreground into an intersection. To the right, a dark hedge borders a brown staircase ascending towards the middle ground, next to a building partially covered in ivy. On the left, a grey car and a cyclist are on the road, while further into the intersection, a dark SUV is turning right. In the distance, a large building under construction with green netting is visible to the left, with snow-capped mountains beyond, and traffic lights with yellow signals are positioned at the intersection.

end of description

In subsequent frames, the grey car and the cyclist on the far left slowly move forward, nearly exiting the frame. The dark SUV in the mid-ground continues its right turn, shifting further to the right of the intersection. A white van gradually appears from behind the brown building and hedge on the far right, moving towards the viewer. The traffic light, initially yellow, transitions to green, and distant pedestrians are seen continuing their movement across the street.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a wide street intersection dominates the midground, with a black SUV turning left and a white SUV approaching from the right, surrounded by multiple lamp posts and traffic lights. To the viewer's right, a large set of reddish-brown stairs with a dark railing ascends, adjacent to a grey sidewalk extending forward from the viewer's position. In the background, a building under construction with green netting is visible on the left, another tall building on the right, and distant snow-capped mountains appear under a cloudy sky.
end of description
The black SUV in the intersection continues its left turn, moving from the center to the left, slightly away from the viewer. Simultaneously, the first white SUV (initially approaching from the right) advances into the intersection towards the center-right. Subsequently, a second white SUV enters the scene from the far left of the intersection, moving rightward across the street. The black SUV completes its turn and exits the frame to the viewer's left. Both white SUVs continue their paths, with the first white SUV now positioned centrally in the intersection and the second white SUV advancing further from the left.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows an urban street intersection with a light gray road and sidewalks. To the viewer's right, a wide set of reddish-brown stairs with a silver handrail leads upwards. In the midground, a white SUV is turning left across the intersection, while another white SUV waits to its left, facing towards the viewer's left. A tall building under construction with green-tinted windows rises on the far left, beyond a black pole with 'no parking' and 'no stopping' signs. Distant snow-capped mountains are visible in the background, to the left of the intersection.

end of description

The white RAV4 completes its left turn and exits the frame to the viewer's left, as the second white SUV begins moving forward, also turning left through the intersection. A pedestrian then appears in the mid-ground, walking from the viewer's right across the crosswalk towards the left, passing newly visible orange traffic cones. The pedestrian continues across the street and exits the frame to the left. Finally, a dark sedan enters the intersection from the viewer's right, moving forward along the path the white SUV previously took.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a street intersection from a sidewalk, with brick steps immediately to the right. A pedestrian in an orange vest stands in the mid-ground, beginning to cross the street from right to left, while a white SUV waits on the far left road. City buildings, including a tall green construction site, line the streets with distant mountains visible under an overcast sky.
end of description
As frames progress, the pedestrian moves further left across the intersection and away. The traffic light on the left turns from green to yellow then red, while the right-side light turns green, allowing the previously stopped cars on the left to proceed through the intersection.
