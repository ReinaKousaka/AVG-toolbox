A wet, dark city street at night is viewed from a low angle, with a striped crosswalk in the foreground. To the left, a sidewalk extends under scaffolding, while a building with glass storefronts like "CHAMPS" is on the right. In the mid-ground, a cyclist with a delivery bag is on the crosswalk, moving left, positioned near a stopped garbage truck and several white planters. Tall illuminated buildings line the dark background, with red traffic lights visible above. end of description
From this viewpoint, the cyclist proceeds left across the crosswalk, eventually reaching the left side of the frame. Simultaneously, a pedestrian appears from the far left and walks rightward across the crosswalk. The traffic lights remain red throughout, and snow flurries become more visible in the air during these frames, adding to the consistent dark and wet street conditions.
