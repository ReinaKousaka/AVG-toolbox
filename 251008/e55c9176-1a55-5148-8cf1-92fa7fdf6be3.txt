A bicycle with a turquoise basket is in the foreground-left on a sidewalk that lines a row of storefronts, notably 'ELADIA'S KIDS' on the right and 'BURRITO' further back. In the mid-ground left, a woman in a plaid shirt walks towards the viewer, followed by another woman in a patterned dress, all set against a background of urban buildings and a street with parked vehicles. end of description
The woman in the plaid shirt walks closer to and then past the viewer to the left. Concurrently, the woman in the patterned dress also approaches from the background, and new pedestrians emerge further down the street behind her, continuously moving towards the viewpoint.

In the first frame, a person wearing a plaid shirt is partially visible at the far right, near the viewer. A storefront with a black bench and red velvet ropes on gold stanchions is positioned to the right of a paved sidewalk that extends into the distance. On the left side of the sidewalk, a woman in sunglasses and a floral dress walks towards the viewer, with a dark minivan parked to her left and a green A-frame sign nearby. Red brick buildings, a tree, and a traffic light line the street in the background to the left, while a "Bogota Latin Bistro" sign is visible further down the street on the right under a clear blue sky.

The partial figure on the far right quickly moves out of view. Simultaneously, the woman walking on the left sidewalk approaches the viewpoint and then passes towards the far left of the frame. Behind her, a man emerges from the distance, walks towards the viewer along the sidewalk, becoming more prominent before also passing into the left foreground, progressively revealing more of the distant street, buildings, and outdoor seating areas further down the block.
