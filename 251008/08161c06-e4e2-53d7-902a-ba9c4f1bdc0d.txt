The first frame displays a street scene under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. In the foreground, an asphalt road with white and dark grey markings stretches towards the center, bordered by a green grassy strip and a sidewalk on the right. To the viewer's left, a row of residential buildings with beige/white facades and red tiled roofs line the street. In the midground, a black car is visible at an intersection, while on the right, a large grey building with a red roof and a prominent yellow "Netto" sign stands, preceded by a yellow diamond-shaped street sign.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the road, causing the buildings and a fence on the left to become more prominent and detailed while shifting to the viewer's left. The black car at the intersection continues to move away from the viewer's immediate forward path. Simultaneously, the yellow diamond street sign on the right approaches, grows larger, and then moves past the viewer, revealing a circular no-stopping sign on a new pole to the front-right of the viewer's path.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame presents a sunny urban street scene leading to an intersection, with a paved road marked with white lines in the foreground. To the left, a large dark-roofed building and a street lamp are followed by several orange-roofed houses, while to the right, a gray-and-orange-roofed commercial building and a prominent round black road sign stand, with green areas and trees behind it.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the black road sign on the right moves out of frame to the right, revealing a yellow directional sign that now appears in the mid-ground to the right of its original hidden position. Concurrently, a large yellow billboard on the white building in the center-right background becomes significantly clearer and more prominent as the viewer approaches the intersection. The perspective shift also makes the buildings on both sides appear closer, and subtle changes in foreground road markings indicate forward motion.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a paved road in the foreground, curving towards the right with several multi-story buildings, featuring white facades and red tiled roofs, lining the left side in the midground. To the right of the road, a large yellow 'Netto Marken-Discount' billboard is prominent on a grassy shoulder, with a white camper van and red car visible behind it, all beneath a blue sky dotted with white clouds.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward through subsequent frames, the yellow billboard on the right shifts out of frame to the right, revealing a yellow mailbox that was previously obscured behind it. Concurrently, the street scene, including the buildings to the left and the road itself, appears closer, while the camper van and red car on the right also recede out of view.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a two-lane asphalt road extending forward under a blue sky with scattered white clouds, flanked on the left by a fence and a line of green trees, and on the right by a large white building with a red roof. Further down the road on the right, other buildings with red roofs and a blue canopy are visible, with several cars parked in front of them, while a distant church steeple can be seen peeking above the trees on the far left.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily advances along the road, causing the large white building on the immediate right to recede from view. Concurrently, a cream-colored building with a blue canopy and the parked vehicles (a white car, red car, and white van) further down the road on the right become closer and more prominent. The streetlamp and lush green trees on the left also approach the viewer, and the previously partially obscured church steeple on the distant left becomes significantly clearer and larger.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
A gray asphalt road with white markings and dark patches occupies the bottom half of the first frame, with a sidewalk running along the right edge. To the immediate right stands a light-colored building with a reddish-orange tiled roof, and in front of it, a white van, a red car, and a white convertible are parked. A large green tree and dense foliage line the left side of the road, accompanied by a streetlamp. Further down the road in the center, several buildings are visible, including one with a blue canopy, and a prominent church steeple with a pointed spire rises in the distance slightly to the left. The sky above is blue with scattered white clouds.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the parked red car and white convertible on the right gradually recede out of view, moving to the right and behind the first-frame viewpoint. The white van also moves further behind the initial viewpoint, progressively revealing more of the building with the blue canopy structure. The streetlamp on the left passes by, moving to the left and behind the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, a black car initially in the distance approaches closer to the first-frame viewpoint, and a manhole cover is newly revealed directly in front of the advancing viewer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame places the viewer on a road with a manhole cover at the bottom center. A black SUV is parked on the left side of the road, facing away, while dense green foliage lines the left. On the right, a building with a light facade features a prominent blue canopy marked "Kfz-Reparatur - Reifen," with a red-roofed building behind it. In the distant center, a church steeple rises above other buildings, all under a clear blue sky with white clouds.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the black SUV on the left approaches and exits the frame to the left. Simultaneously, the blue canopy and "Kfz-Reparatur" sign on the right recede and move out of view, revealing more of the building and a black metal fence along the sidewalk. The distant church steeple and buildings further down the road appear progressively larger and closer, remaining centered, while the surrounding trees and buildings on both sides continually pass the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a paved road stretching into the distance under a clear blue sky with white clouds. To the left, dense green foliage and tall trees line the roadside, with a prominent evergreen tree in the upper left. To the right, a sidewalk runs alongside a light-colored building with a red roof, fronted by a dark fence. In the center distance, a tall church tower with a pointed spire is visible, surrounded by other buildings and trees.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The initial foreground objects, like the fence and the light-colored building on the right, move towards and then out of the right side of the frame, revealing a "TATTOO HIER" sign on the building. Simultaneously, a streetlamp emerges from behind the foliage on the left and moves progressively closer and then past the viewer. The distant church tower and buildings in the background appear to grow larger as the viewer approaches them.
