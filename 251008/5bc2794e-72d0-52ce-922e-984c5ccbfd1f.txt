The first frame captures a rainy street scene with a wet red brick sidewalk extending from the bottom left towards the mid-ground. On the far left, a small building with a red sign stands next to a yellow and white signboard. In the foreground right, a black metal railing separates the sidewalk from a street featuring a yellow-striped crosswalk. On the wet street, several cars are visible, and a purple electric scooter is parked on the left sidewalk near the curb, with another scooter further right near the crosswalk. In the mid-ground, a person holding an umbrella and wearing orange pants is walking across the distant crosswalk from right to left, while in the background, numerous tall buildings are silhouetted against an overcast sky.

The person with orange pants and an umbrella in the distant crosswalk continues to move from right to left, eventually exiting the scene to the far left. A new individual holding a yellow umbrella then emerges on the viewer's left sidewalk, standing near the small building. Concurrently, a large white truck and a black sedan drive from the right side of the main street, traveling leftward across the street in front of the background buildings, passing behind the foreground railing, and eventually exiting the frame to the left, while the person with the yellow umbrella remains stationary on the left sidewalk.

The first frame displays a rainy urban street. A wet red brick sidewalk stretches from the foreground along the left side, bordered by a dense green hedge. To the right, a black metal fence partially obscures a zebra crossing, with a purple electric scooter parked upright just behind it. Further right and in the midground, a multi-lane road is visible with several cars stopped at an intersection under traffic lights showing red and yellow, accompanied by a blue directional sign. In the background, numerous high-rise buildings are silhouetted against a cloudy, overcast sky.

In the following frames, the scene becomes dynamic as vehicles on the wet road begin to move. The traffic light at the intersection changes, causing the black car positioned prominently to the viewer's right, and the white car behind it, to proceed forward and turn right, gradually exiting the frame. Other vehicles further down the road also advance through the intersection, while the consistent rain continues to fall across the entire scene.
