The first frame displays a rainy night cityscape with a wet street and white crosswalk dominating the foreground-left, reflecting red and green traffic lights. A central tree trunk with a black bin, a wet sidewalk, and a utility pole with banners occupy the foreground-right, while city buildings and additional traffic lights mark the midground and background.

A black car, initially appearing from the far left of the first-frame viewpoint, moves across the crosswalk towards the midground-right through the sequence of frames. By the later frames, this car has largely exited the left-midground view, as another vehicle with bright headlights becomes visible approaching from the distant right side of the intersection. The traffic lights consistently show red on the left and green on the right throughout the scene.

The first frame depicts a rainy night street scene with a wet crosswalk spanning the foreground from bottom left to bottom right. Two dark utility poles stand slightly left and right of the frame's center, with a small tree between them. A red banner and yellow sign are attached to the left pole, while traffic lights (green for straight/right) are visible on the right pole. Reflected streetlights, distant building lights, and a white car's headlights straight ahead illuminate the wet asphalt and buildings lining the street.

A white bus with blue and pink decals appears from the mid-left of the intersection, moving horizontally across the crosswalk towards the right. The bus continues its movement, passing between the viewer and the distant headlights. It then exits the frame completely to the right, leaving the street wet and the distant headlights still visible.

The first frame depicts a wet city street at night, viewed from a low angle. A dark utility pole stands prominently in the foreground-center, partially obscuring a tree trunk to its immediate left, with a segment of tiled sidewalk visible to its right. The street, adorned with white crosswalk stripes, extends into the midground, reflecting numerous colored lights from surrounding buildings and traffic signals. A red traffic light is seen on the far left, while two green traffic lights, one indicating a U-turn, are positioned in the midground-center-right. Distant headlights of an approaching vehicle are visible further down the street on the right, and illuminated buildings line the background.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, a white arrow marking gradually appears on the crosswalk to the far left, becoming fully defined by frame 6. Concurrently, the vehicle with headlights in the midground steadily approaches the viewer. By frame 7, the green traffic lights in the center-right change to yellow, and the car continues its forward motion through the remaining frames.
