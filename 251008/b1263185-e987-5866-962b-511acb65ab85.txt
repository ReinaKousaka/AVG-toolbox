The first frame displays a narrow dirt path receding into a dense green forest, flanked closely by tall tree trunks and lush undergrowth on both sides, with the bright sky peeking through the canopy above.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the path, the immediate foreground trees on both sides move past the viewer and recede behind, while new segments of the path and previously distant trees are continually revealed ahead. The path appears to straighten slightly within the frame as the camera advances deeper into the continuous, verdant forest environment.
