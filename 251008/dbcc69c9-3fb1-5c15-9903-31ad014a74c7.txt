In the first frame, a paved road with a white dashed line occupies the foreground and midground, curving gently to the right. To the viewer's immediate left, a steep, brown embankment supported by a stone wall rises, topped with a rockfall netting and sparse trees. A metal guardrail borders the right side of the road, behind which are tall evergreen trees. In the background, a majestic snow-capped mountain peak is visible centrally, flanked by forested mountains, all under a blue sky dotted with white clouds.

The scene dynamically moves forward along the road, causing the immediate roadside features, like the guardrail and embankment, to recede from the viewer's perspective. As the vehicle progresses, the forested mountain slopes to the right become more prominent, revealing greater depth in the valley relative to the initial viewpoint. A small blue sign indicating '25 km/h' briefly appears on the right guardrail. The snow-capped mountain in the background gradually appears larger and closer, while the trees framing the road on both sides pass by, showcasing the continuous journey through the mountainous landscape.

The first frame shows a mountain road curving slightly ahead, with a steep, brown hillside protected by a rockfall fence on the left, and a metal guardrail alongside dense evergreen trees on the right. Directly ahead, a prominent snow-capped mountain peak rises beneath a partly cloudy blue sky.

As the viewpoint progresses forward along the road, the immediate hillside and guardrail recede, revealing more of the expansive forested mountains on both sides. The snow-capped peak in the distance becomes larger and shifts slightly rightward relative to the frame's center. A tall, bare tree on the right side also becomes more prominent as the camera passes the initial evergreen cluster, widening the view of the valley ahead.
