The first frame presents a paved road curving to the left, with a red car visible ahead on the left side of the road, bordered by a steep, tree-covered hillside. To the viewer's immediate right, a concrete barrier covered in ivy stands, beyond which a grassy field containing a wooden structure extends towards distant mountains and a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the camera advances, the red car moves closer and passes on the left, while the concrete barrier and wooden structure on the right recede from the first-frame viewpoint. A second, silver vehicle subsequently emerges behind the red car as more of the winding road and verdant landscape ahead are continuously revealed.
