A street scene features a red and white crosswalk prominently in the foreground, extending forward from the viewer. To the immediate left, a person on a white scooter faces away, while further along the left sidewalk, pedestrians walk under a green covered walkway lined with shops. On the right, a multi-lane road runs parallel to the sidewalk; a white SUV moves away from the viewer, and a man in a dark coat and mask stands on the road near the crosswalk, facing the viewer. Numerous multi-story buildings with commercial signs like 'IQOS', 'KFC', and 'Ringer Hut' line both sides of the street, receding into the distance under an overcast sky.

The person on the white scooter moves further left and away from the viewer, eventually exiting the frame entirely to the left. Concurrently, the white SUV continues to travel away on the road to the viewer's right, also exiting the frame. Meanwhile, the man in the dark coat and mask steps onto the crosswalk from the right side of the street and proceeds to walk across it towards the left sidewalk, progressively moving closer to the viewer's left.

A man in a black coat and mask is walking from the right foreground across a red and white striped pedestrian crossing towards the left mid-ground. To the left of the crossing, a sidewalk extends into the background, lined with several pedestrians and illuminated storefronts under a green covered walkway, with a bicycle parked near the viewer. To the right, a multi-lane road stretches into the background, where a white car and a dark car are visible, flanked by tall buildings with commercial signs like "Ringer Hut" and "KFC."

The man in the black coat continues to move across the pedestrian crossing from the right foreground towards the left, eventually exiting the frame. Concurrently, a light blue car emerges from the right mid-ground and travels down the road towards the background, passing the stationary vehicles. The pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue their movement away from the viewer.

In the first frame, a Japanese street scene is viewed from a low angle on a sidewalk. In the immediate foreground on the left, a red and white striped crosswalk extends towards the right, with a manhole cover visible on it. To the left, a pedestrian sidewalk stretches into the distance, covered by a long, green-canopied arcade with bright lights; several pedestrians walk along it, while one person in a dark coat stands near a red post at the sidewalk's edge. To the right of the viewer, a wide asphalt road runs parallel to the sidewalk, with a black car visible further down and another black vehicle (likely a taxi) beyond it. Across the road, another row of buildings with illuminated shop signs, including prominent white and yellow billboards for "高屋" and "Ringer Hut," is also covered by a similar green canopy, and more pedestrians are visible on that far sidewalk. Tall, multi-story buildings form the background on both sides under a pale sky.
end of description
On the left sidewalk, a person wearing a mask and dark clothing walks towards the viewer, approaching a standing person near a red post who begins checking their phone. Concurrently, a black car on the road to the right drives forward, moving away from the viewer. The approaching pedestrian passes the standing individual, who remains mostly stationary. As the walking person continues towards the foreground, now carrying a blue bag, a bicycle becomes more distinct behind the standing figure. The black car eventually proceeds further down the street and moves out of view to the right.
