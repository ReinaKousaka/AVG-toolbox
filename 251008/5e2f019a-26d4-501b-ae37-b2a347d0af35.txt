A narrow residential street extends forward, flanked by houses under a clear sky; to the left, a white picket fence, potted plants, and a mailbox pillar are in the foreground, while a red and white traffic cone sits to the right, in front of a beige house.

The viewpoint advances along the street, causing the traffic cone and the left-side foreground objects to move behind the viewer. This forward movement reveals more of a beige house and its covered car on the left, and a longer facade of the beige house with a blue base on the right, as a manhole cover on the road approaches.

The first frame displays a narrow residential street extending forward. On the left, a white car is partially visible behind a dark metal fence and foliage, under a carport attached to a brown two-story house with a white balcony and a satellite dish. Further down on the left, another lighter house is visible. On the right, a beige two-story house with white shutters stands behind a tall green bush and a low white fence with a blue tiled base. In the distance, a white two-story house and a blue two-story house with a white gate are centered. Utility wires cross the clear sky above, and a manhole cover is on the dark paved road.

The camera moves forward along the street. The white car on the left gradually recedes and moves out of view, revealing a dark gate and more of a textured concrete fence structure that were initially further from the first-frame viewpoint. The white and blue houses further down the street appear progressively larger and closer, approaching the first-frame viewpoint. The beige house and its fence on the right also grow in prominence, moving closer to the initial viewpoint, with more of its patterned blue tiled wall becoming visible.

The viewer is positioned on a paved residential street, looking forward. To the immediate left, a multi-story brownish-pink house with a white balcony and satellite dish is visible, bordered by a low stone wall and green hedges. To the immediate right, a white picket fence sits atop a blue tiled wall, partially obscuring a large green shrub and a light beige house behind it. Further down the street, a white two-story house is centered, with a blue two-story house to its right. Utility wires crisscross the clear sky above.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly advances down the street. As the camera moves forward, the structures on both the left and right sides recede, revealing more of their facades and extending further back relative to the viewer's original position. On the left, an air conditioning unit becomes visible beneath the windows of the brownish-pink house. The white and blue houses further down the street progressively appear closer and slightly larger as the scene unfolds.
