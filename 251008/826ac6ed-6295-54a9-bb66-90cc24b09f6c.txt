The first frame shows a paved road winding into the distance, viewed from a vehicle (hood visible at bottom). To the left, a steep, tree-covered hillside rises, with a small barrier near the lower edge. To the right, a grassy slope with bollards and a mesh fence borders dense forest, beneath distant forested mountains and a bright sun in a clear sky, with two wires overhead.

As the vehicle progresses, objects move closer and eventually pass the initial viewpoint. The barrier on the left moves out of view behind and to the left, revealing more of the steep rock face that constitutes the hillside. Concurrently, a wooden utility pole, initially distant on the right, approaches and passes to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, while the right-side bollards and fence also recede behind the original perspective.

The bottom of the first frame shows the front part of a silver vehicle. A winding asphalt road with a dashed white center line extends from the foreground into the midground, curving slightly to the left. To the left of the road is a steep, rocky hillside covered with green trees. To the right, a grassy verge features several grey concrete bollards and a white wire fence further back, with more trees beyond. In the distant background, tree-covered mountains rise under a clear blue sky, with a bright sun in the upper right.

As the scene progresses, the vehicle moves forward along the road. In the second frame, a red bucket briefly appears on the grassy verge to the right of the road, then disappears from the third frame onwards. The rocky hillside on the left and the concrete bollards on the right advance towards and past the viewer. The distant tree-covered mountains remain in the background as the car navigates the curving road.
