In the first frame, an outdoor restaurant seating area with black umbrellas, tables, and chairs occupies the left, with people visible at some tables. Behind it, a row of colorful buildings (yellow, blue, orange, white) lines a street. To the right, a river flows with a wooden boardwalk and metal railing in the foreground, and a small boat in the middle distance. A bridge spans the river further back, with hills under a clear blue sky beyond.

The viewpoint advances forward along the promenade. New outdoor restaurant seating, including tables, chairs, and 'Leffe' branded displays, continuously appears from the far right on the path's left side, while previously visible elements move left and out of frame. Concurrently, new sections of the railing and wooden boardwalk progressively emerge from the right. The boat on the river drifts further downriver, slowly moving left relative to the river's center. People on the path and at tables shift their positions, and new individuals become visible as the camera progresses.

The first frame depicts a vibrant riverside town scene under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's left, an outdoor café area with black umbrellas, tables, and chairs, including a "Leffe" branded menu stand, borders a paved walkway. Further left, a row of colorful multi-story buildings lines the street, with people walking in the midground. To the viewer's right, a wide river flows, separated from the walkway by a wooden and metal railing, and a small motorboat moves on its surface in the midground, heading left. In the background, a bridge spans the river, with hills dotted with houses visible beyond it.

The viewpoint subtly advances forward along the paved walkway. Consequently, the café tables and menu board to the left of the initial view gradually recede and move out of frame to the left, revealing more of the walkway ahead. Simultaneously, more of the wooden railing on the right, previously closer to the viewer, is revealed as the camera progresses. The motorboat on the river continues its movement downriver, appearing further to the left from its first-frame position.
