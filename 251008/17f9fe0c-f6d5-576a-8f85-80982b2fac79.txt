The first frame depicts a city street scene with a dark gray Tesla Model Y parked on the left foreground, behind which another dark car is partially visible. An ornate black metal fence and stone staircase occupy the right foreground, while a sidewalk extends into the midground where other parked cars line the left curb and a blue bus is seen further down the street, beyond pedestrians walking. Tall brick buildings line both sides of the street, extending into the background under a clear sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the camera viewpoint slowly pans right, causing the parked Tesla on the left to gradually shift out of the frame, revealing more of the street and cars beyond it. Concurrently, the black fence and staircase on the right shift slightly left within the frame, exposing more of the building's facade to the right, as pedestrians continue walking further down the sidewalk.

The first frame captures a city street scene with a black car occupying the immediate foreground on the left, while an ornate black metal fence and stone steps are prominent on the immediate foreground right. A sidewalk extends into the midground where pedestrians walk away from the viewer, paralleled by a row of parked cars on the left and a black outdoor dining structure on the right, all framed by tall city buildings receding into the background.
end of description
As the video progresses, the viewpoint subtly shifts right, revealing more of the street and parked cars extending further left and down the street from their initial positions. The ornate fence and steps on the right become more prominent, shifting slightly left within the frame as the pedestrians continue moving forward away from the viewer.

The first frame displays a bustling city street with an ornate dark metal railing and stone steps leading to a building entrance in the immediate right foreground. To the left, a dark grey car is parked along the curb, followed by a red SUV, with the street and more vehicles extending into the distant background beneath tall buildings. On the sidewalk in the midground, a black outdoor dining structure with round windows is visible, with several people standing nearby, positioned in front of a building displaying the "Sotheby's" sign in the background.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the ornate metal gate in the right foreground begins to swing open inwards, progressively revealing more of the building's entrance staircase and door directly behind its initial closed position. The gate continues to open throughout the sequence, with both sections folding back against the adjacent wall by the final frame, fully exposing the entrance.

The first frame captures a city street scene from a sidewalk perspective, featuring a row of parked cars on the left, a "Madison Av" street sign further down, and a busy street beyond. To the right, a building with an ornate facade showcases an establishment with a black awning and a semi-enclosed outdoor dining structure, while several pedestrians are gathered on the sidewalk in the middle ground.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the group of pedestrians, including a person pushing a stroller, slowly moves forward along the sidewalk, gradually passing by the black outdoor dining structure.

The first frame captures a vibrant city street scene from a ground-level perspective. In the foreground to the viewer's left, a red SUV is partially visible, parked curbside, followed by a dark SUV. The sidewalk extends from beneath the viewer towards the background, featuring a white kiosk in the midground left. A group of pedestrians, including women and children with a stroller, are walking away from the viewer on the sidewalk in the midground. To the viewer's right in the midground, a black restaurant exterior with an awning marked 'TOKUGAWA ART OF SUSHI' and a 'Serafina' sign above it on the building, features circular window cutouts. The background reveals a long street lined with tall brick and stone buildings, green street signs for 'Madison Ave' and another street, and distant traffic.

No dynamic changes or newly revealed objects or scenes occur in the subsequent frames; all provided frames are identical to the first, showing no movement within the scene relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a street scene unfolds with a dark blue car parked on the far left, partially visible, next to a light gray newsstand on the sidewalk. To the right, a black outdoor dining structure, labeled "TOKUGAWA ART OF SUSHI" and featuring three circular windows, extends from a building. Several individuals, including women and children with strollers, are gathered on the sidewalk near this structure. In the background, a busy street identified as "Madison Ave" by a green sign extends into the distance, lined with buildings and showing parked and moving vehicles. An intersection with traffic lights and street signs (including a "ONE WAY" sign) is visible slightly to the left of the center.
end of description
As the video progresses, the camera subtly pans slightly to the right, maintaining its general elevation and distance from the foreground objects. The group of people on the sidewalk shifts their positions marginally, with some appearing to move closer to the entrance of the sushi restaurant, while all other objects, including the parked car and newsstand on the left, remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a dark car and a grey information kiosk are visible in the immediate foreground to the left. On the midground sidewalk, a group of pedestrians is gathered to the left, adjacent to a black outdoor dining structure for "TOKUGAWA ART OF SUSHI" on the right, featuring multiple circular windows. Behind them, a street with parked cars, traffic lights, and street signs ("Madison," "One Way") extends left, leading to tall city buildings in the background under a clear sky.

end of description.

The group of pedestrians, initially gathered on the midground sidewalk to the left, begins to walk rightward across the crosswalk. As they proceed, new sections of the street and sidewalk are progressively revealed behind their movement, while vehicles continue to pass along the background street from left to right.
