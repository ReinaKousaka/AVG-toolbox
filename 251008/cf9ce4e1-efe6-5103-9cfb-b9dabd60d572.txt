The first frame displays a rainy city street scene with a paved sidewalk stretching into the distance on the left. A brown wooden bench is positioned in the lower left foreground, and a row of green plants fronts a building with illuminated signs to the left. Two individuals carrying umbrellas walk away from the viewer on the sidewalk, while to the right, trees, a lamppost, and a tall black information sign flank a wet road with cars moving away.

Over the subsequent frames, the two people with umbrellas continue walking further down the sidewalk away from the viewer. Cars on the wet road also progress forward, with vehicles shifting positions and new ones appearing from the right as others exit the scene. The street sign on the right slightly reveals more of its content, providing additional textual information.

The first frame depicts a rainy urban street with a wet, brick-paved sidewalk on the left, leading away from the viewer. A woman holding a patterned umbrella walks away from the viewer on the left sidewalk, past a building adorned with illuminated signs and green plants. Further down the sidewalk, to her right, another person with a dark umbrella is also walking away, while on the right side of the frame, a street with several cars, trees, and a street sign extends into the distance, with a dark information board partially visible on the far right.

In subsequent frames, the woman on the left sidewalk continues walking further away from the viewer. The person with the dark umbrella moves forward, appearing to cross the street from the middle of the frame towards the right. Simultaneously, cars on the street to the right continue to move away, with a green taxi and a yellow truck becoming visible further down the street, and a silver car with headlights on moves closer to the viewer on the far right.

The first frame depicts a wet urban street scene during a downpour. On the left, a tiled sidewalk runs into the distance, bordered by buildings with illuminated storefronts and lush green foliage. Partially visible in the extreme foreground left is a person holding a black umbrella. In the midground, a pedestrian with a black umbrella is crossing the street from left to right on a marked crosswalk, between two trees and a street light pole. On the wet street to the right, a green car is prominently positioned on the right side, with a yellow truck and other cars further down the street, all appearing to move from right to left. Tall buildings line the street in the background, beneath an overcast sky.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the first person with a black umbrella continues crossing the street, moving from the mid-left of the crosswalk towards the far right. Simultaneously, the green car on the street travels from the mid-right towards the far left, eventually exiting the frame. A second pedestrian emerges from behind the pole on the right side of the crosswalk, initially without an umbrella, then subsequently raises one as they proceed to cross from right to left. The yellow truck and other vehicles maintain their general movement from right to left further down the street.
