The first frame shows a bustling street scene with pedestrians walking away from the viewer down a narrow path flanked by buildings. In the immediate foreground, a woman in a grey top and another in a green cap are on the left, while a man in a dark shirt is partially visible on the right, holding a cane.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the foreground pedestrians on both sides move further away and out of view, revealing more of the paved street surface. New pedestrians continually enter the scene from behind the initial viewpoint and proceed down the street, following the path of those initially present. The buildings and overall street structure remain unchanged as foot traffic consistently moves into the distance.

In the first frame, a paved street stretches into the distance under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left, a building with colorful striped roller shutters and awnings is visible, with two people in the foreground walking towards the viewer; a male shielding his eyes and a female looking at a phone. Along the right, a white building with a garage door transitions to a brick building featuring a circular "Dresser" sign. Further down the street, several pedestrians walk away from the viewer, flanked by more buildings and overhead power lines.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the two individuals in the foreground continue walking past the viewer, gradually moving out of the frame to the viewer's left. Concurrently, the other pedestrians visible further down the street maintain their general movement away from the viewer into the distance. The static elements of the street, buildings, and sky remain unchanged as the dynamic movement unfolds.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame captures a narrow urban street extending into the distance under a clear blue sky. Buildings line both sides: to the left, closed storefronts with striped shutters and awnings; to the right, a brick wall and a garage door. In the mid-ground, two pedestrians walk away from the viewer down the center of the street, where "Pedestrian Priority" is painted on the asphalt.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera subtly moves forward along the street. The two pedestrians, initially in the mid-ground of the first frame, continue to walk further away into the distance from the original first-frame viewpoint, gradually appearing smaller. Objects like the painted street text also recede further ahead from the initial perspective.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a narrow street bordered by buildings, with a storefront featuring a partially closed corrugated metal shutter on the viewer's left and a brick wall to the right. Several pedestrians walk away from the viewer down the street, which has white Korean text and yellow lines, towards a cluster of people further ahead under utility wires.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward down the street, the two leading women in the foreground continue walking further away. More of the storefront on the viewer's left, including a glass door, becomes visible, and a longer section of the brick wall on the right is revealed as the camera advances into the scene, making the distant crowd appear closer.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a narrow street receding into the distance, flanked by brick buildings under a clear sky. In the foreground, two women walk away from the viewer over white Korean text on the asphalt; the left woman in purple carries a white bag, and the right in pink carries a red bag. Utility poles, potted plants, and various signs are visible on the left, while more pedestrians appear further down the street. end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the street, the two women continue moving ahead into the midground relative to the original position. More of the street's brick facades, signs, and additional pedestrians previously in the midground become closer to the viewer, revealing the path further down the alley.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a sunny, narrow urban street from a first-person perspective, looking down the road. Two women walk away from the viewer in the foreground; the one on the left wears a purple top and jeans, while the one on the right wears a pink top and light pants, both carrying bags. Buildings with brick facades line both sides of the street, with traffic signs on the left and a '31' address plaque on the right, leading to other pedestrians further down the road.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street, maintaining a steady pace behind the two women. The women walk further into the distance relative to the initial viewpoint, and the '보행' road marking moves from the foreground past them. Objects like the potted plants and parts of the left fence, as well as the right brick wall, gradually recede from view and pass out of frame, revealing new sections of the street and buildings further ahead.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on an asphalt path with white markings, looking down a bustling urban street. Immediately to the viewer's left is a dark metal gate leading to a brick building, alongside utility poles and various street signs, including a blue circular 'no entry' sign and a green 'P' parking sign. To the viewer's right, a long red brick wall with a yellow line on the ground extends into the distance, followed by a multi-story brick building. Two women are walking away from the viewer in the middle of the path, with many more pedestrians visible further down the narrowing street in the mid-ground, flanked by buildings under a bright sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The two women walking ahead continue to move away from the initial viewpoint, gradually revealing more of the path they traverse. Objects initially further down the street, such as the distant crowd and buildings, appear closer and more detailed as the viewer approaches them. Conversely, the initial foreground objects, like the dark gate and street signs on the left, shift spatially, moving past and to the sides of the viewer's initial position.
