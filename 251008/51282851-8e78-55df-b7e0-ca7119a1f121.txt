Two individuals, their backs to the viewer, occupy the immediate foreground, obscuring a path winding through grey, craggy rock formations. Beyond these rocks, a traditional Chinese building with an ornate tiled roof and a balcony, where people are visible, stands centrally in the background, flanked by tall bamboo on the left and a gnarled tree trunk on the right.

As the frames progress, the two foreground individuals move slightly further away and to the left, revealing more of the rocky path and enhancing the visibility of the building in the distance. The overall scene subtly brightens as the camera appears to move slightly forward and upward.
