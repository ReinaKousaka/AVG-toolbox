The first frame displays a paved walkway extending away from the viewer, flanked by lush greenery. On the left, tall bamboo plants grow in raised planters, while on the right, a small tree, various bushes, and a lamppost are present. Four people are walking away from the viewer down the center of the path, led by two women, one in a light brown top and one in black. Overhead and in the background, a large orange-brown metal bridge structure with visible beams spans across the scene.

As the frames progress, the group of four people steadily walks further away from the viewer down the paved path. The viewpoint subtly moves forward, maintaining a similar perspective behind the walking group as they continue to advance into the distance.
