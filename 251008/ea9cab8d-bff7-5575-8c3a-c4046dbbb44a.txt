First, a nighttime city street scene is depicted, with a paved sidewalk occupying the left foreground and mid-ground. To the immediate left are two potted plants, beyond which a building with shopfronts extends down the street. On the right, a treelined street with streetlights runs parallel, with a road and distant buildings visible behind. Several pedestrians are scattered along the sidewalk, some walking towards the viewer and others walking away.
end of description
The viewpoint remains fixed as pedestrians move along the sidewalk; two women walking towards the viewer approach and then pass to the right of the original viewpoint. A police car with blue flashing lights appears on the distant road to the right, moving past the first-frame's right edge. Other figures on the sidewalk progress further down the street.

The first frame captures a nighttime city street scene with a wide paved sidewalk extending into the distance. Very close to the viewer, partially out of frame on the right, is a blurred woman in a light-colored dress. To the viewer's left, a building with large, illuminated shop windows, one displaying "MANGO," lines the sidewalk. On the right side, a row of trees and streetlights runs parallel to the sidewalk, separating it from a street where vehicles, including one with blue flashing lights, are visible further in the background. Several pedestrians are walking away from the viewer along the sidewalk.
end of description
The blurred woman in the foreground swiftly moves entirely out of frame to the viewer's right. The group of pedestrians initially walking away on the sidewalk continues to recede further into the distance. A man in dark shorts and a grey t-shirt, first partially visible on the far right of the sidewalk, fully enters the frame and walks away from the viewer, passing a bench to the right. As the scene progresses, other pedestrians become more distinct on the left side of the sidewalk, also moving into the distance. By the final frames, a red bicycle is briefly visible on the street further down to the right.

The first frame captures a well-lit city promenade at night, with a "MANGO" store on the left where a woman walks towards the viewer. In the center, a group of four people walk away, while to the right, trees line a parallel street featuring streetlights and a distant police car with blue flashing lights.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the woman on the left continuously advances closer to the viewer and slightly across the promenade. The group of four in the center simultaneously recedes further into the distance, as the police car remains visible and stationary to the right with its flashing lights.
