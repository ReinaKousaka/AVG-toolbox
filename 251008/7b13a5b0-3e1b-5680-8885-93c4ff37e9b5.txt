The first frame depicts a rainy street scene with a dark utility pole in the mid-left foreground, flanking a wet asphalt road stretching into the hazy distance. To the left of the road are a black fence and dense trees, while to the right, a brick sidewalk features a prominent tree, further trees, a street light, and two parked electric scooters.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the most prominent dynamic change is the continuous, varying intensity of the rainfall across the entire scene. Raindrops create visible ripples and reflections on the wet road and sidewalk surfaces. Puddles on the ground subtly shift in appearance due to the ongoing precipitation. The hazy visibility in the distance remains consistent as the rain persists.

The first frame presents a rainy street scene featuring a large tree trunk in the immediate foreground, positioned between a wet asphalt road on the left, marked with white lines, and a brick sidewalk with a green strip on the right, where a lamp post and an electric scooter are visible, all surrounded by dense trees on both sides extending into a misty background.

The scene then slowly pans to the right, causing the foreground tree to move out of the frame to the left, and subsequently, a yellow umbrella begins to descend from directly above the viewer, gradually covering the upper sky and distant foliage.

The first frame captures a rainy street scene under a yellow umbrella, featuring a dark pole in the mid-left, behind which a tree with a yellow warning sign and a green electric scooter are positioned. To the left lies a wet asphalt road lined with bollards and distant trees, while to the right, a paved sidewalk leads to a bus stop, backed by a dense green embankment of trees and bushes. end of description. As the camera slowly pans to the right, the foreground pole, tree, and scooter progressively shift left and out of view, revealing more of the wet sidewalk, the bus stop, and the extensive treed and bushed area to the far right of the scene, all under continuous heavy rain.
