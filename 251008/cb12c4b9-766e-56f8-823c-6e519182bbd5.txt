The first frame displays a street scene under rainy conditions. In the foreground, a concrete curb with yellow and black stripes is visible at the bottom left, with a potted plant behind it. A red and white barrier arm extends horizontally from the left across the mid-ground, above a wet road leading into the distance, which is lined by white bollards. To the right, a sidewalk with several trees runs parallel to the road, featuring a parked white SUV and green bushes further along, with buildings and signs visible beyond them. Tall apartment buildings are discernible in the hazy background on the far left.

The red and white barrier arm on the left dynamically rotates upward, gradually opening its path. Concurrently, the rain appears to intensify, with increased visible splashing on the wet road surface. In the later frames, a person holding an umbrella becomes visible walking away from the viewer down the road in the mid-distance on the left side of the street.

The first frame displays a rain-soaked street scene. In the foreground, a wet road with yellow and black striped speed bumps occupies the bottom left, adjacent to a grey sidewalk on the right, where a dark tree trunk stands on the far right. The midground features a street extending into the distance, lined with green trees on both sides, and a row of orange and white bollards delineating the right side of the road. Several white vehicles are parked on the right side of the street, further from the viewer, while a person with a red umbrella is faintly visible on the distant left sidewalk. Buildings are partially obscured by trees in the background, all under heavy rainfall.

Subsequent frames show the continuous heavy rainfall. A green traffic light gradually becomes visible in the mid-right, and a colorful market stall umbrella appears further along the right sidewalk, behind the parked white SUV. A second white vehicle, an SUV, slowly emerges into view from the distant mid-right, appearing to move slightly closer to the viewer. Concurrently, a person holding a white umbrella becomes more distinctly visible moving forward on the distant left side of the street.
