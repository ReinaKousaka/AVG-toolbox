As the viewpoint subtly progresses forward, the woman in the beige coat moves further away to the right. Subsequently, several more pedestrians, many wearing face masks, emerge from behind the initial woman and populate the mid-ground, walking forward along the street. The vibrant outdoor dining area and storefronts continuously appear to the left and right, respectively, as the perspective shifts slightly into the lively street.

A woman in a pink top and black jacket emerges from the right mid-ground and walks diagonally across the viewer's right, towards the distant background. The outdoor dining areas on both sides of the street become more extensive as new tables and patrons are gradually revealed further down the path, relative to the initial view.
