In the first frame, a wet road occupies the left, with a white truck moving away, partially obscured by a dark fence and large trees. To the right, a reflective, wet sidewalk extends into the distance, bordered by a line of trees and a tall, colorful sound barrier on the far right.

The white truck quickly exits the scene to the left, and a "Rain Everyday" watermark appears in the bottom-left. Subsequently, a yellow pedestrian warning sign is revealed on a lamppost to the left of the sidewalk. Dark vehicles, followed by a white car, then consecutively drive away from the viewer on the wet road to the left.

A wet urban street scene unfolds, with a black metal fence in the foreground separating a reflective sidewalk on the right from a multi-lane road on the left. A large tree trunk stands directly behind the fence, with a street pole featuring a red triangular pedestrian crossing sign positioned slightly further back. A white car is driving away on the wet road in the midground, to the left of the viewer, while a long row of trees lines the sidewalk on the right, receding into the distance. Parallel to the sidewalk on the far right is a sound barrier wall with green, pink, and yellow panels. The sky is overcast, and rain is visibly falling.

The white car on the road continues to move away to the left, further into the distance. Another car with red taillights emerges from the midground on the road and also drives away to the left. Subsequently, a black SUV appears from the left, closer to the viewer than the previous cars, and drives away into the distance on the wet road. Throughout, rain continues to fall, creating visible streaks and splashes on the glistening surfaces of the road and sidewalk.

The first frame captures a wet urban street scene, with a black metal fence running along the lower left, bordering a tiled sidewalk. A parallel darker paved path extends to the right, separated from the sidewalk by a line of green-leafed trees that recede into the distance. On the far right, a colorful corrugated wall with horizontal stripes extends, while a road with a dark car moving away is visible on the left under a hazy, rainy sky.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the dark car on the left side of the road steadily recedes further into the distance, joined by other vehicles continuously appearing and moving away. The consistent rainfall maintains a reflective sheen on all wet surfaces, while the overall perspective of the street remains static.
