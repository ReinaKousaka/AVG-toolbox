The first frame depicts a wet urban street under an overcast sky, with commercial buildings lining both sides. In the immediate foreground to the right, the rear of a white Kia sedan is visible, featuring a "No Parking" sign on an orange stand next to its right rear wheel, with a red bicycle part partially seen behind it. To the left, a white Hyundai sedan is parked on a red-painted section of the road, facing away from the viewer, beside a sidewalk with various businesses displaying Korean text signs. In the midground, a line of cars, several with illuminated red taillights, proceeds down the street away from the viewer. Utility poles and wires crisscross above the distant buildings.

The viewpoint slowly advances along the street. The white Kia sedan and "No Parking" sign on the right gradually recede towards the bottom right of the frame, revealing more of the wet road markings behind them. Concurrently, the parked white Hyundai on the left also moves further into the background relative to the viewer. In the final frame, a new white SUV enters the scene from the bottom left, partially obscuring the front of the parked Hyundai. The line of cars in the midground shifts further into the distance as the viewer's position progresses forward.

In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a wet, paved street on an overcast day. To the immediate left, the front driver's side wheel and partial body of a white SUV are visible, while to the immediate right, the rear quarter panel and bumper of a white sedan occupy the bottom of the frame, with a red and white "No Parking" sign partially obscuring its front. Further down the street on the left, a white sedan is parked, and opposite it on the right, a white SUV is also parked next to a red brick wall. The street stretches into the distance, flanked by buildings, utility poles, and other vehicles displaying red brake lights.

The white SUV on the immediate left begins to move forward, its brake lights briefly illuminating. Simultaneously, the white car on the immediate right also moves forward and out of the frame. As these vehicles advance, the red and white "No Parking" sign shifts downward and out of view, revealing a previously partially obscured white sedan parked further along the right side of the street. The white SUV continues its forward movement into the midground.

The first frame shows a wet, rainy street scene from a low vantage point. A white SUV with illuminated red brake lights is directly in front, facing away, on the wet asphalt road. To its left, a white sedan is partially visible on a red-painted section of the road, and a person with an umbrella walks on the sidewalk further back on the left. To the right, another white SUV is parked partially on the wet sidewalk and partially on the road, facing away. Buildings line both sides of the street, with utility poles and wires overhead, and a '30' speed limit sign is visible on the right. The sky is overcast.
end of description
A white utility truck emerges from behind the central white SUV and drives towards the viewer in the left lane. Simultaneously, the person with the umbrella continues walking away from the viewer along the left sidewalk. The white SUV directly ahead and the white SUV parked on the right remain stationary throughout the sequence. The other vehicles further down the street also appear largely immobile.
