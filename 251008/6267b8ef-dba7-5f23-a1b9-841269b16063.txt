The first frame presents an aerial view of a coastal town, with a large harbor and pier on the right, showing several docked ferries and a small boat in the dark blue water. Numerous multi-story buildings populate the midground to the left of the harbor, stretching towards green mountains that rise prominently in the background under a sunset sky. end of description. The subsequent frames initially show only subtle lighting changes over the same town and harbor. Then, the scene abruptly cuts to a completely different aerial viewpoint, revealing a large church with a red roof and a tiled plaza surrounded by other city buildings, located further inland and presumably to the left of the first-frame's coastal area. Within this new scene, the camera subtly zooms out and pans slightly downward, revealing more of the plaza in the foreground.
