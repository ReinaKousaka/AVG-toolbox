The first frame captures a rainy city street scene from a low viewpoint, with a reflective, rain-soaked asphalt road featuring white pedestrian crossing stripes in the foreground. A large dark dump truck, labeled 'MAN', partially visible on the far right, is moving away from the viewer, while two white cars in the midground approach the viewer, all vehicles creating significant water splashes. To the left, a sidewalk recedes into the distance with pedestrians holding umbrellas, alongside trees and a street sign, backed by tall buildings and traffic lights in the background.

The dump truck moves further to the right and exits the frame, while the front white SUV continues driving towards and then past the viewer, generating large splashes. Subsequently, a smaller white car appears behind the truck's initial position and a dark SUV emerges behind the first two white cars, both proceeding towards the viewer through the water. Finally, a dark blue SUV enters the frame from the right, also moving towards the viewer, navigating the wet street.
