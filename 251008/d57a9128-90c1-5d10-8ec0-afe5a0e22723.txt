In the first frame, a bustling urban street at night is visible. To the left foreground, a man in a dark, fur-hooded jacket walks towards the right, partially obscuring a person holding a dark umbrella behind him and another individual with a face mask to his immediate right. In the midground-right, three street musicians are seated with guitars and an accordion, an open blue umbrella and equipment near them, and a small cardboard box on the wet pavement. Further right in the midground, two women, one masked, walk left, carrying shopping bags. Brightly lit storefronts like Zara and Marks & Spencer line the background, with pedestrians visible inside and outside.

Following frames show the foreground man and his companion moving further right, initially obscuring the street musicians and then revealing them more clearly to their left. The two women walking on the right continue their path towards the left, eventually passing behind the foreground figures as new pedestrians appear further left in the background. The initial foreground figures then exit the frame to the right, while the street musicians remain relatively stationary throughout the sequence.
