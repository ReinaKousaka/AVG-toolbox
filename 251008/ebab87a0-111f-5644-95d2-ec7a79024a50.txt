frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a street scene with a blue vending machine on the viewer's immediate left, adjacent to a gray building facade. A paved sidewalk extends from the foreground into the midground, where a leafless tree stands beside a low hedge, leading to a utility pole and a multi-lane road stretching into the distance, all under a clear, sunny sky with buildings lining both sides of the street.
end of description
A pedestrian emerges from the left midground, near the building entrance, and walks across the street, moving from the viewer's left towards the right. The pedestrian continues past the utility pole and exits the frame to the far right.

A paved sidewalk extends from the viewer's immediate front-left, alongside a large grey building. To the right, a road stretches forward, featuring a bare-branched tree in the mid-foreground, encircled by low bushes, and a zebra crossing further ahead. Overhead, traffic lights display red, with distant buildings lining both sides of the street and a white car visible on the far right. end of description. The traffic light, positioned directly ahead and slightly left, changes from red to yellow, then to green. Simultaneously, the white car, initially in the far distance on the right side of the road, advances forward past the orange traffic cones.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame captures a paved urban sidewalk leading to a street intersection with a prominent crosswalk in the center. To the viewer's left is a grey building, while a tree trunk and low, sparse hedge are positioned to the right. Beyond the intersection, buildings and utility poles line the street, where a white van is visible in the mid-distance under a bright, sunny sky.
end of description
As frames progress, the white van on the mid-distance road moves forward and to the right, receding from the viewer's perspective. Concurrently, another lighter-colored vehicle appears further down the road and also proceeds right, suggesting ongoing traffic flow at the intersection.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows the viewer on a brick sidewalk adjacent to a street intersection. To the right, a road with a crosswalk stretches towards the middle ground, where prominent traffic lights and utility poles stand before a dark building directly across the intersection. Further down the street to the right, other buildings and a white van are visible.
end of description
A white SUV, initially stopped at the crosswalk to the viewer's right of the intersection, begins to move forward. It proceeds steadily from the right across the crosswalk towards the left side of the intersection, almost clearing the pedestrian crossing by the final frame.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
A paved sidewalk occupies the foreground with shadows stretching from the viewer's left towards the center. To the left stands a building wall and some greenery, while ahead in the midground, a median with foliage separates the sidewalk from an intersection featuring a white crosswalk. A utility pole with a prominent red traffic light for cross-traffic marks the corner, with a white SUV positioned on the crosswalk to the viewer's right, and a white van and a dark car further down the road.
end of description
The white SUV, initially on the crosswalk to the viewer's right, dynamically moves left across the intersection and exits the frame by frame 5. The dark car, previously positioned behind the SUV and to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, then slowly inches forward towards the intersection. The traffic light on the utility pole consistently displays a red signal throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The viewer is positioned on a paved sidewalk with a large grey building and a green bush to the immediate left. Ahead and slightly to the left, a long bed of green bushes, partially covered by green netting, runs parallel to the sidewalk, separating it from an intersection to the right featuring a crosswalk. Further right and in the mid-ground stands a dark multi-story building with a yellow pole at its corner, all beneath a bright, clear blue sky with visible sun glare.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the elongated shadow on the paved sidewalk, cast by the lamppost, subtly shifts and shortens, moving slightly towards the right. Concurrently, the sun glare in the upper right portion of the sky appears to slightly intensify, indicating a minor change in the sun's angle or atmospheric conditions, without any new objects or significant movements occurring in the scene.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a paved sidewalk leading into the distance, with a dense green hedge, partially covered by a green mesh, running along its right side. To the far left, a light-colored building is visible, while a darker, multi-storied building with balconies and a 'クリーニング' sign stands on the mid-right. A black streetlamp is positioned centrally ahead, and a traffic light pole is prominent on the far right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts rightward, revealing more of the dark building on the right and a new facade of a light-colored building appearing on the far left. The shadows on the right side of the sidewalk noticeably lengthen and move slightly left, consistent with a subtle change in perspective.
