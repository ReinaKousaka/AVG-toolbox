The first frame displays a modern restaurant dining area featuring a light-colored rectangular table set for four, positioned centrally with two wooden chairs in front and a dark grey booth behind. A rope-wrapped pillar is prominent in the foreground to the right, while dark cabinetry is partially visible on the far left. The back wall showcases vertical panels with warm lighting from below.

The camera slowly pans to the right, causing the initial table and booth to shift leftward within the frame. As the rope-wrapped pillar moves further to the right and eventually out of view, a second, identical dining table with booth seating is progressively revealed to the right of the first table, expanding the visible dining area. Concurrently, the cabinetry on the far left moves out of the frame.
