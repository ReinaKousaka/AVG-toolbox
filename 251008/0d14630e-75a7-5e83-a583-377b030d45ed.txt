The first frame captures a city street leading into the distance under a cloudy sky. To the left, a prominent wooden barrier parallels the viewer, beyond which lies a service lane with a white delivery van closest, flanked by trees and buildings, including a tall skyscraper further back. On the right, parked cars line the street in front of buildings featuring red awnings, while modern glass buildings are visible in the background.

As the viewpoint advances, the white delivery van on the left moves out of frame, revealing a blue and white van and other vehicles in the service lane. The wooden barrier and the parked cars on the right, including a white van and a grey SUV, recede past the viewer, exposing more of the sidewalk and revealing pedestrians near the cafe awnings. The tunnel entrance in the mid-distance becomes progressively closer as the scene progresses.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a street with a yellow barrier on the immediate left, bordering a road that leads towards a tunnel entrance slightly right of center, where a 'no entry' sign is visible. To the left, behind the barrier, are trees, parked vehicles including a white van, a black van, and a blue car, alongside commercial buildings. On the right, parked cars line the curb, a pedestrian walks, and taller buildings rise further back under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward, making the yellow barrier and the existing 'no entry' sign on the left appear closer and larger, while also revealing a new 'no parking' sign below it. Simultaneously, a white car emerges in the left lane, moving towards and past the initial viewpoint, and the tunnel entrance also approaches.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows the viewer on a road facing a tunnel entrance directly ahead. To the left, a multi-lane road is separated by a wooden barrier, with a silver and white car driving away from the viewer, while lush green trees line buildings further left. On the right, a curving road is visible with several parked cars and a pole displaying circular road signs. In the background, a tall skyscraper stands on the far left, and a large, modern building with many windows is in the center-right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer slowly moves forward towards the tunnel entrance. The silver and white cars on the left continue moving away from the viewer. The cluster of road signs on the right side of the road expands and becomes clearer, eventually revealing a '4.1m' height restriction sign which was previously further behind the initial signs. The tunnel entrance appears larger and closer as the viewpoint advances.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a road with white crosswalk markings extends directly in front of the viewer, leading to two dark tunnel entrances. A light-colored wooden barrier runs along the left side of the road, beside which a tall, multi-story building is visible, partially obscured by green trees. To the right of the road, a sidewalk leads up an embankment, with a large, modern building featuring many windows further in the distance, alongside some reddish-purple trees. Above the tunnel, an overpass spans the view under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward towards the tunnel, a dark car appears from the left mid-ground, traveling alongside the viewer, and steadily moves ahead. Subsequently, a second dark car emerges behind the first on the left, followed by a third appearing further back. Concurrently, a prominent streetlight on the right side of the road moves from the mid-ground towards the foreground, eventually exiting the frame to the right.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a road with a crosswalk advancing towards two dark tunnel entrances directly ahead, flanked by a wooden-railed ramp ascending to the left and a curb on the right, beneath a concrete overpass; tall buildings rise in the background to the left and right, with a red-leafed tree on the far right.
end of description
A motorcycle rider then appears on the elevated ramp to the left, moving horizontally across it and disappearing. Subsequently, a silver car emerges from the left tunnel entrance, slowly approaching the viewer along the left lane of the road, becoming largely visible by the final frame.
