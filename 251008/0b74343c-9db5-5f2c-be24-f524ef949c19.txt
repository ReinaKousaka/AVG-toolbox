The first frame presents a wet, tree-lined street scene. To the left, a black metal fence borders a glistening paved road with distant green trees, while a row of trees with dark trunks stands on the sidewalk between the viewer and the fence. On the right, a narrower wet path runs parallel to a densely forested embankment.

Throughout the subsequent frames, continuous rain visibly falls, creating ripples and intensifying reflections on the wet surfaces. Cars intermittently pass on the road in the middle distance, moving away from the viewer, while a "Rain Everyday" watermark appears in the bottom-left from frame 5 onwards.

The first frame presents a wet, reflective pathway extending forward from the viewer, bordered on the left by a black metal fence. Beyond the fence, a wet asphalt road with sparse vehicles recedes into the misty distance under a canopy of green trees. Several tree trunks line the pathway's left edge, with one displaying a blue bicycle sign directly ahead. To the right of the pathway, dense green foliage climbs a slight incline, behind which a colorful fence is visible further back.
end of description
The primary dynamic change across the frames is the continuous falling rain, evident from numerous visible droplets and ripples on the wet surfaces of the road and pathway. Vehicles intermittently pass on the road to the left in the mid-distance, creating splashes as they move through the rain. The ambient light and static elements of the scene remain unchanged, highlighting the persistent rainfall and vehicle movement. Towards the end of the sequence, a "Rain Everyday" watermark appears in the bottom-left corner.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a rainy street scene: a wet asphalt road with a black metal railing separating it from a narrower, wet sidewalk on the right. Several trees with dark trunks are positioned between the railing and the sidewalk, and a blue circular sign with a white bicycle symbol is visible above the second tree from the left. In the mid-distance on the left, cars are driving on the road, while the far right reveals a green fence or wall with colorful markings, backed by dense green foliage.
end of description
As the viewpoint gradually shifts forward and slightly to the left, the blue bicycle sign moves progressively out of the upper-center frame. The camera's forward motion reveals more of the wet sidewalk and additional sections of the black railing and colorful fence along the right, while distant cars continue to traverse the rain-slicked road.
