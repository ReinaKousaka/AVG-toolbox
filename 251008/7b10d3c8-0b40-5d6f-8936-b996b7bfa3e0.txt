The first frame presents a bright room with light wood flooring. A cream-colored pool table with a black felt surface lies in the mid-right, extending towards the foreground. Two black high-top tables, each with two black bar stools, are visible: one centrally to the left of the pool table, and another to the pool table's right, near a window with a white curtain. In the background, large glass sliding doors reveal an outdoor balcony with a black railing, leading to a view of distant buildings and trees; a ceiling fan hangs above the balcony. To the far left, a black vertical railing borders a drop-off, and a window with green curtains allows a glimpse of the outdoors.

The camera slowly pans left. The pool table and the high-top table on the right move out of view to the right of the original frame's center. Concurrently, the original left high-top table becomes more central, and a black wall-mounted shelf with a geometric design is progressively revealed on the far left wall, to the left of this high-top table's initial position. The outdoor balcony scene, initially centered, shifts to the right, showing more of the outdoor seating and distant apartment buildings.
