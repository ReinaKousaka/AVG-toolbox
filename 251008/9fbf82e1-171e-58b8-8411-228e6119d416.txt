In the first frame, a bustling shopping arcade is visible, extending into the distance under a grand arched glass roof. In the immediate foreground, a young boy in an orange jacket is on the far left, next to another boy in a green jacket. Centered slightly to the left, a bald man in a navy hoodie with a Union Jack flag on the back stands facing right, holding a red bag. To the right, several individuals with their backs to the viewer walk away, while ornate shopfronts like "SAINT LAURENT" and "LONGCHAMP" line the left side, and similar architectural details are on the right.

The two boys in the foreground progressively exit the frame to the viewer's left. The bald man in the navy hoodie remains near his initial position, turning his head and body to his right as he looks at a newly revealed phone in his hands. Meanwhile, a man in a blue shirt and green pants, along with a woman in a blue jacket, emerge from the midground and walk directly towards the viewer, becoming more prominent.
