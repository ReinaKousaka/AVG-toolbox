In the first frame, a dark metal pole with a white rectangular sign displaying a bicycle symbol and Korean text ('우회전시') is prominently positioned in the left midground, slightly to the viewer's left. To its left, a wet city street reflects red traffic lights and vehicle taillights, with a white delivery truck, a white taxi, and other cars queued. A blue bus is visible further down the street, also to the left of the pole. To the pole's right, a wet, grey-tiled sidewalk extends into the distance, bordered by several bare trees and streetlights, leading towards a white building set behind a stone retaining wall and yellow barriers on the far right. Heavy rain visibly streaks across the entire nighttime urban landscape.

The camera slowly pans to the right, gradually moving the foreground pole out of view to the left. The blue bus and other vehicles on the street continue to move forward and further away from the first-frame viewpoint. As the view shifts, a dark blue scooter or bicycle parked beside a tree on the sidewalk becomes newly visible in the mid-right, and the building and stone wall to the right of the initial frame become more central and detailed.

The first frame displays a rainy night street scene with a wet, patterned sidewalk to the viewer's right, featuring bare trees, a lamppost with a pedestrian warning sign, a bicycle, a scooter, and yellow barriers near a stone wall. To the viewer's left is a wet road reflecting red traffic lights, where a blue bus is visible in the mid-ground, followed by several cars.
end of description
The blue bus progressively moves away from the viewer down the street, becoming smaller and revealing more of the road and the cars behind it. The accompanying white and red cars also advance, continuing their movement further into the distance relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a rainy city street at night, with a patterned sidewalk, a yellow barrier, and a teal scooter on the right. A utility pole with a yellow pedestrian crossing sign and a chained bicycle stands left of center, separating the sidewalk from a wet road reflecting red lights. A blue bus (7223) and a white car are visible on the left side of the wet road, with distant city lights and buildings in the background.

Subsequently, the blue bus and the white car on the road, positioned to the left of the viewer, slowly move forward. Concurrently, the distant traffic lights ahead of the bus transition from red to green.
