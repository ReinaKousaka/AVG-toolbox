The first frame displays a wet city street and sidewalk extending into the distance, lined with buildings and shops, under an overcast sky. A green Mini Cooper moves away on the left, while other cars are parked or in traffic further down the street; on the right, a person with an umbrella walks along the wet sidewalk. end of description. Subsequently, the green Mini Cooper continues moving further away from the viewer. A white Jaguar and SUV, initially parked left of the viewer, begin driving forward, and a new silver car enters from the left foreground, also moving away down the street. The pedestrian on the right sidewalk consistently proceeds further into the background.

The first frame displays a wet city street with a sidewalk on the right, lined by storefronts, and a street on the left populated by moving and parked cars. A silver sedan in the left midground and a person with a purple umbrella on the right sidewalk move away from the viewer towards the background, where tall buildings pierce the cloudy sky.
end of description
Subsequently, the silver sedan and other vehicles proceed further down the street, and the individual with the umbrella continues to recede into the distance. A black SUV then appears behind the original moving vehicles, followed by a yellow taxi cab, both moving forward from the left foreground relative to the initial viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a wet city street on an overcast day. To the left, a yellow taxi is partially visible near a parking meter, with a line of parked cars extending into the distance, including a silver SUV with a bike rack. A long, wet sidewalk stretches into the background, where a person holding a black umbrella walks away from the viewer on the right side. Along the right, storefronts with large display windows and awnings line the sidewalk, leading to taller buildings in the background.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the yellow taxi on the left moves forward, gradually revealing a white car previously obscured behind it. Concurrently, the person with the umbrella on the right sidewalk continues walking further away from the viewer, deeper into the scene.

The first frame depicts a wet urban street under an overcast sky. A wet road occupies the left half of the frame, where a grey SUV with a bike rack is parked in the mid-ground, followed by a line of other cars receding into the distance on the left. A wet sidewalk runs parallel on the right, bordered by storefronts featuring large windows. On this sidewalk, a person holding a black umbrella walks away from the viewer. Tall, modern buildings line the distant horizon on both sides, with the sky appearing dull and grey above them.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the person holding the black umbrella, initially positioned further along the right sidewalk, progressively walks closer to the viewer. Simultaneously, a dark grey SUV enters the scene from the distant left of the first-frame viewpoint, driving along the wet street towards the viewer. This moving SUV then passes the stationary grey SUV parked on the left side of the road.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a wet city street on an overcast day, with a woman in a light purple jacket holding a black umbrella and bag walking towards the viewer on the right sidewalk, past storefronts. To her left, several cars are parked along the curb, including a prominent silver SUV in the mid-ground, and multi-story buildings line both sides of the street, receding into the background.
end of description
The woman on the right sidewalk continues walking past the viewer's initial position, moving further right and eventually exiting the frame on the right. Simultaneously, a large white truck, previously partially obscured behind the parked cars on the left, moves into clearer view on the street, also advancing towards the viewer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a city street scene looking forward, with a wide wet sidewalk and retail stores (Rimowa, Jimmy Choo) under a glass canopy on the right. To the left, a silver SUV with a bike rack is parked closest to the viewer, followed by other cars and a white Sysco delivery truck further down the street, with tall buildings in the background.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the white Sysco delivery truck, initially positioned further down the street on the left, slowly moves forward past the first-frame viewpoint. All other visible objects, including the parked silver SUV in the foreground and the surrounding buildings, remain stationary throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a city street scene from a pedestrian's perspective, looking forward down a sidewalk. To the left, a silver SUV is parked in the immediate foreground, with its rear facing the viewer. Behind it, a line of cars, including a dark sedan and a dark SUV, are parked along the curb, next to buildings with ground-level storefronts. To the right, a wide sidewalk leads past upscale retail stores with large glass windows, featuring displays with items like luggage and clothing, and signs for "RIMOWA" and "JIMMY CHOO." Tall, modern buildings dominate the background on both sides of the street under an overcast sky.
end of description
The video shows a subtle forward movement of the viewer along the sidewalk. The silver SUV on the left foreground gradually shifts further to the left and slightly out of view as the perspective advances. Subsequently, the dark sedan and other parked cars behind it become more prominent and central, effectively moving from a mid-ground to a more foreground position relative to the advancing viewpoint. The storefronts and distant buildings on both sides subtly shift their framing due to this forward progression.
