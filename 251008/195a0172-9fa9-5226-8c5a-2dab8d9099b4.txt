In the first frame, the viewer is on a two-lane road, likely a bridge, with a double white line down the center. To the left, a white guardrail runs parallel to the viewer, behind which is a building with a brown roof, green trees, and distant rocky mountains. Ahead in the left lane is a silver SUV, followed by a dark car. To the right, a silver guardrail is visible, beyond which are more trees and buildings, with a red traffic light and more mountains in the distant background under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the road, causing the silver SUV and the dark car on the left lane to approach, then pass to the viewer's immediate left. Simultaneously, the buildings and mountains in the distance appear closer, and a dark car in the right lane also moves closer. Road signs, including a '30' speed limit, become more prominent on both sides of the road as the viewer advances. The traffic light on the right side of the road changes from red to green, indicating passage through an intersection.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a road on a sunny day, with a dark blue car occupying the lower-left foreground. The road extends centrally into the distance, marked with white lines and the number '30' on its surface. To the left, a light brown building with a brown roof is visible, fronted by a white guardrail and a circular '30' speed limit sign; green trees are behind it. To the right, a metal guardrail parallels the road, beyond which several buildings are seen, including a gas station with an "AVIA" sign and a blue rectangular sign displaying a '30' speed limit. A white SUV is approaching in the distant center-left lane, with mountains in the far background under a blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the dark blue car in the immediate front-left quickly exits the frame. The white SUV, initially distant, approaches and passes the viewer on the left side of the road, moving past the original viewpoint. Simultaneously, the "ZONE 30" road marking advances from the distant front to beneath the viewer, and the blue rectangular '30' speed limit sign on the distant front-right moves out of view to the right. The gas station details and buildings on the front-right become increasingly clear as the viewer progresses.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a road extending away from the viewer, flanked on the left by a large light-brown building and on the right by an "AVIA" gas station showing price displays. A white car is visible ahead in the left lane, with several other vehicles further down the road, all under a clear blue sky with distant mountains.
end of description
As frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road; the white car initially ahead on the left passes the viewer's original position. The buildings on both sides, previously further ahead, progressively enlarge, revealing new details such as a "KABARA AUTOSERVICE" sign on the right building, which was beyond the initial "AVIA" station. Other vehicles initially further down the road become closer as the perspective advances.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The viewer is on a paved road with white lane markings. To the immediate left is a tall, peach-colored building with cracks, while to the right is a cream-colored building housing "KABARA AUTOSERVICE" with a visible garage bay and a yellow utility vehicle in front. In the mid-ground, a green vintage pickup truck approaches in the left lane, followed by a silver van and another dark car receding into the distance. Beyond the urban structures, mountains rise in the background under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The green vintage pickup truck continuously moves closer to the viewer from the mid-ground and eventually passes to the viewer's left, partially obscuring the peach building. Meanwhile, the silver van and the dark car in the left lane continue to recede further away from the viewer towards the distant mountains.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a sunny street scene with a road extending directly ahead towards distant mountains under a clear blue sky. To the left, a light-colored building stands prominently, followed by a brick building with greenery. On the right, a cream-colored building with a 'Garage Weibel' sign and a motorcycle in front is visible, followed by a gas station with a red canopy and pumps. Further ahead on the road, a dark sedan is closer to the viewer, followed by a lighter-colored van.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the road. The dark sedan, initially ahead and slightly to the left, passes by to the left of the viewer. Concurrently, the lighter van ahead slowly recedes further into the distance. The buildings on both sides, including the garage and gas station on the right, appear to move towards the edges of the frame as the viewpoint advances past them.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a road leading into the distance with a silver van ahead and a black car approaching from the left. To the left, a brick building and distant mountains are visible, while to the right, an AVIA gas station with parked white vans and a multi-story building is seen under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The black car on the left approaches the viewer, while a white van and then another black car emerge from behind the brick building on the left and drive away. Simultaneously, a person in red appears at the gas station on the right, opening the rear door of one of the white vans, as the overall scene gradually progresses forward.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a sunny street scene with a paved road extending directly in front of the viewer, marked by white broken lines and a solid white line on the right. A silver minivan is visible ahead, driving in the same direction. To the immediate left, a long brick building parallels the road, with a small dark tree in front of it. Further down the road on the left, an intersection is apparent with other vehicles (a white van and a white car), and a multi-story building stands behind them, while distant mountains rise under a clear blue sky. To the right, a gas station forecourt features a prominent white van parked at a pump, with its rear door open and a person in red nearby.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The silver minivan ahead recedes further, while a white car and another white van become increasingly visible to the left, approaching the intersection. The gas station on the right and the brick building on the left gradually shift out of the foreground, revealing more of the gas station's interior facade and obscuring the person in red behind the white van on the right as the viewer passes.
