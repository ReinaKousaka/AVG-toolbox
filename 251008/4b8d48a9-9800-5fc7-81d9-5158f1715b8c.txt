The first frame captures a sunlit urban sidewalk flanked by a modern glass building displaying an "ABIKO CURRY SET MENU" sign immediately to the viewer's left. A paved path leads forward, partially shadowed, past a glass subway entrance structure on the right where a person in dark clothing stands near the entrance, with distant buildings and trees completing the scene.

Subsequently, the person near the subway entrance on the right begins walking away from the viewer along the sidewalk, while simultaneously, an elevator inside the glass structure on the right moves, briefly revealing a blue element within.

The first frame depicts a sunny city sidewalk scene looking forward. To the immediate left, a large "ABIKO CURRY SET MENU" sign is prominent, followed by other storefronts where a few pedestrians walk further down the street away from the viewer. On the right, a glass-enclosed structure, likely a subway entrance, stands with a person beside it, next to some sparse trees.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the distant pedestrians on the left sidewalk gradually move further away, and the traffic light in the far background changes from green to red.

The first frame captures an urban sidewalk scene. To the left, a building with glass storefronts displays colorful food advertisements and a prominent sign featuring an orange octopus logo. A white cart is positioned near one of the building's entrances. In the middle ground, a paved sidewalk extends into the distance, where several pedestrians walk away from the viewer towards a street lined with buildings and trees. To the right, a modern glass-enclosed structure, resembling a subway or escalator entrance, stands beside a person in a dark jacket facing away from the viewer, near a sign indicating "Way to Airport Railroad."
end of description
The camera remains static throughout the sequence. The pedestrians initially in the middle ground continue walking further away from the viewer along the sidewalk, gradually receding into the distance. The individual on the right, next to the glass structure, slightly shifts their posture and appears to interact with a device in their hands.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts an urban street with a wide paved sidewalk extending forward from the viewer's position. To the viewer's immediate left, a modern building lined with large glass storefronts displaying food images and Korean text runs parallel to the sidewalk, featuring a door in the foreground and several fish tanks slightly further along. To the viewer's right, a transparent glass and metal structure, possibly a subway entrance, stands near the foreground, beyond which lies a grassy strip with red poles, leading to a street with distant buildings straight ahead.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera subtly shifts right and zooms slightly inward. The man previously seen walking away in the mid-ground on the sidewalk continues his path, now accompanied by another person walking behind him, while a partially visible individual on the far right of the first frame moves further right and exits the scene.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a city sidewalk extending forward, with a multi-story building featuring glass storefronts and a white seafood display tank on the immediate left. To the right, a glass-paneled structure with a "Way to Airport Railroad" sign is present, beyond which a street with distant buildings and bare trees is visible, while pedestrians walk away from the viewer on the path ahead. end of description. As the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk, the initial display tank and glass structure on the viewer's respective sides recede and exit the frame. Consequently, more of the storefront on the left and the general street scene further ahead on the right are revealed, as pedestrians continue their movement.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a bright urban street with a building on the left featuring large reflective windows and multiple Korean restaurant signs, including prominent "곱창" and "부대찌개" advertisements. To the right, a sidewalk with tactile paving is visible, alongside a strip of dry bushes and red-orange conical signs, one depicting an AREX train logo. In the midground, a woman in a pink top walks towards the viewer on the sidewalk, with other pedestrians and distant buildings lining the street ahead.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the sidewalk. The woman in the pink top continues walking towards the viewer, eventually passing to the viewer's left. Simultaneously, the red-orange conical signs on the right recede further behind the viewer's initial position as more of the street ahead is gradually revealed.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a woman wearing a mask and a pink top walks towards the viewer on a sidewalk to the left, adjacent to a building with a glass facade displaying Korean signs. To the right, the sidewalk borders dry vegetation and ascends uphill, with other pedestrians visible in the midground and distant buildings and a traffic light under a bright sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the woman on the left walks past the viewer, moving closer and then exiting the scene to the lower left. Concurrently, the other pedestrians in the midground continue their walk away from the viewer, appearing further up the street as the scene progresses.
