The first frame depicts a rainy city street at night, looking down a narrow thoroughfare lined with multi-story buildings. In the immediate foreground and center, a person holding a black umbrella walks away from the viewer, their figure and the vibrant neon lights reflecting strongly on the wet, brick-patterned pavement. Shops with numerous illuminated Korean signs in various colors (red, blue, green, white) flank both sides of the street, extending into the background where other pedestrians with umbrellas and distant vehicles are visible. A dark, possibly overcast sky or elevated structure is visible above the buildings in the far background.

As the frames progress, the central figure with the black umbrella continues walking away from the viewer, moving deeper into the street. Simultaneously, a scooter emerges from the far background and moves towards the middle ground, passing behind other pedestrians. The various pedestrians visible on the street continue their movements, changing their specific positions relative to each other within the scene.

The first frame presents a wet, reflective city street at night, stretching into the background between buildings adorned with numerous brightly lit neon signs, predominantly in Korean script, on both the left and right sides. In the mid-ground, a person holding a black umbrella walks away from the viewer on the left, while a scooter with a rider approaches centrally, accompanied by another pedestrian walking away. To the right in the mid-ground, a tall red advertising sign displaying billiard balls stands prominently. The street's wet surface vividly mirrors the colorful neon lights, creating streaks of color. An elevated structure spans across the far background.

In the subsequent frames, the scooter quickly approaches the viewer from the mid-ground, passes the red sign on the right, and then exits the scene towards the foreground. Simultaneously, the person with the black umbrella on the left continues walking further away down the street. A person initially walking towards the viewer on the far left moves closer and then past the viewpoint, while another person on the right, initially further back behind the red sign, also walks closer towards the viewer.
