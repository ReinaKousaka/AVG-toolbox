In the first frame, a stone path forks in the foreground; the right path ascends via steps, while the left path proceeds straight and slightly downhill. Lush green and yellowing vegetation covers the ground and slopes on both sides, with numerous trees, including several palm-like varieties, filling the midground and background. A red signpost stands near the fork, positioned between the two paths, while distant misty mountains are faintly visible through the upper canopy.
end of description
The camera's viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly rightward relative to the initial frame. This movement causes the red signpost, originally to the immediate left of the main path, to appear slightly more centered towards the fork. A small, dark rectangular object is gradually revealed on the ground immediately to the left of the left path. Concurrently, the dense foliage on the far right edge minimally recedes, exposing a fraction more of the ascending path further along.
