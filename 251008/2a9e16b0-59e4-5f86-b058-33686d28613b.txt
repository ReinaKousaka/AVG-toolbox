The first frame depicts a narrow cobblestone alley receding into the distance, flanked by buildings. To the viewer's immediate left, a weathered red wooden door is set into a stuccoed wall with a house number '46' above it, while a stone wall with a closed brown shuttered window is visible further down on the right.
end of description
As frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward down the alley. Consequently, the red door and the leftmost stuccoed wall recede from the center and move off-frame to the left. Simultaneously, the stone wall on the right and its window shift closer to the viewer and move slightly off-frame to the right, revealing more of the cobblestone path and the alley extending ahead of the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame presents a narrow cobblestone alley flanked by old buildings under a bright sky. To the immediate left is a tall, rough-textured light brown wall with a dark rectangular opening at its base, while to the right stands a stone wall featuring a window with closed brown wooden shutters.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly moves forward along the alley. This movement causes the rough wall on the left and the stone wall with its window on the right to recede further away from the first-frame's position. Concurrently, new sections of the cobblestone ground are revealed beneath the original viewpoint, and the distant buildings at the end of the alley become progressively closer to the viewer's initial position.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a narrow, sunlit alleyway. To the left, a textured, light brown/ochre wall with a dark vertical pipe dominates the foreground. A cobblestone path, composed of small reddish-brown pavers, leads into the distance, curving gently to the right. On the right, a stone wall features a window with closed brown wooden shutters. Beyond these walls, the alley recedes, flanked by buildings, under a bright sky visible at the top.
end of description
The camera slowly pans to the right throughout the sequence. This reveals slightly more of the stone wall on the right and causes the left ochre wall to recede further towards the left edge of the frame. The cobblestone path, the window with brown shutters on the right, and the distant alleyway remain visible, shifting their positions within the frame accordingly. The overall lighting appears to brighten marginally as the view shifts.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
First frame shows a narrow, cobblestone alley extending forward and slightly curving left into the distance, flanked by buildings. To the viewer's immediate left is a rough, textured wall with a vertical pipe, followed by a lighter-colored building with an arched doorway and a wall lamp. To the right, a stone wall features a prominent brown wooden window shutter. A sliver of blue sky is visible above the distant buildings.
end of description
There are no dynamic changes, newly revealed objects, or shifts in spatial positions observed in the subsequent frames; all images appear identical to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a narrow cobblestone alley flanked by old buildings. To the viewer's immediate left, a textured, light brown stucco wall rises, with a dark vertical pipe or post near its base. On the right, a rugged stone wall features a prominent window with closed brown wooden shutters. The cobblestone path, patterned with reddish-brown stones, recedes into the distance, bordered by further buildings on both sides, including one on the left with a recessed arched doorway and an outdoor light fixture.
end of description
The subsequent frames depict a very slow, forward progression down the alley. The viewer's perspective advances, causing the cobblestone path, the walls on both sides, and the architectural details like the arched doorway and the shuttered window to appear incrementally closer and larger. The continuous movement gradually reveals more of the winding alley further ahead, expanding the view of the path that was previously visible in the mid-ground and background of the initial frame.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a narrow, cobbled alleyway extending into the distance, flanked by stone walls; a black pipe and an arched doorway are on the viewer's left, while a brown-shuttered window is on the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward into the alleyway. The black pipe on the left and the brown-shuttered window on the right recede and move out of view. Consequently, new sections of the stone walls further down the alley on both sides become visible and closer to the viewer, revealing more of the path ahead. The overall scene conveys a continuous forward motion through the sunlit, winding passage.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a narrow cobblestone alleyway extending forward, flanked by buildings. To the viewer's immediate left stands a rugged stone wall featuring a deep arched doorway, beyond which a lighter building with a wall lamp and a rectangular dark opening is visible. To the right, a tall stone wall, adorned with a vertical blue pipe and a grey utility box, forms the other side of the path. Further ahead, the alley narrows, revealing distant buildings and a patch of blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves steadily forward into the alley, causing the immediate left archway and the right stone wall with the pipe to recede further behind the advancing camera's original position. Simultaneously, the light-colored building on the left and the lower stone wall with greenery on the right, initially further down the alley, gradually become closer to the original viewpoint, revealing more of the path that was previously ahead.
