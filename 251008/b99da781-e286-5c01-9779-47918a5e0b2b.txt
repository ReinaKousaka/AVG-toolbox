frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a dirt path extending from the bottom center into the middle distance, veering slightly towards the left. To the left of the path, rocky, grassy terrain rises gently, with a few sparse pine trees in the mid-ground and distant mountains visible in the far left background. A steep, rocky, grass-covered hill dominates the right side of the path, filling the lower and middle right portions of the frame under a clear blue sky that occupies the upper half. An overlay in the bottom left corner shows 'COURSE 295°', 'SPEED 5 MPH', 'ELEVATION 10149 FT', and 'DISTANCE 1.1 MI', while a white outlined map with a marker is in the top right.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the dirt path. The distant mountain range, initially in the far left background, subtly shifts further into the center-left of the view, while the immediate foreground terrain on both sides of the path appears closer. Concurrently, the overlay data reflects a change in the course from 295° to 276°, indicating a slight rightward turn, and the elevation increases by 1 foot.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a dirt trail extending centrally from the viewer into a distant mountain valley under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's immediate left, a large, dark mountain rises, while a rocky, sparsely vegetated hillside ascends on the right. Two distinct pine trees are visible along the trail in the mid-ground. Informational overlays in the bottom left show course, speed, elevation, and distance, with a map outline in the upper right.

end of description

The scene depicts forward movement along the trail, causing the path and surrounding rocky terrain, along with the two pine trees in the mid-ground, to gradually approach the viewer and move upward in the frame. The informational overlay indicates a decreasing course heading from 276° to 270° and a fluctuating elevation (10150 FT to 10149 FT), while speed and distance remain constant. The map indicator in the upper right subtly advances within its outline, confirming progression along the route.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a rugged mountain trail stretching into the distance under a clear blue sky. Directly in front, a rocky, unpaved path leads away from the viewer. To the right of the path, a steep, rocky slope rises, featuring a tall, slender conifer tree in the mid-ground. To the left, another rocky slope with smaller trees and sparse vegetation parallels the path, with large, darker mountains visible in the far background. Distant, hazy mountains appear centrally on the horizon. Overlaid on the bottom left are statistics (COURSE 270°, SPEED 5 MPH, ELEVATION 10150 FT, DISTANCE 1.1 MI), and a white outline map with a marker is in the top right.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the path, causing the immediate foreground rocks and vegetation to recede from the first-frame viewpoint. The prominent conifer tree initially on the mid-ground right steadily approaches, then shifts further right and partially out of the top right of the frame as the viewer passes it. Concurrently, the perspective pans slightly left, bringing more of the path and rocky terrain directly ahead into the center of the view. The distant mountains remain generally fixed in the background, while the on-screen data updates, showing the course changing from 270° to 258° and elevation increasing from 10150 FT to 10151 FT.
