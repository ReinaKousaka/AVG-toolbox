In the first frame, a person with long brown hair, wearing a tan coat and a brown leather backpack, holds a red cup in the immediate foreground, positioned slightly to the right of the viewer's center. To their immediate right, a portion of a striped outdoor umbrella and a white-clothed table are visible. A sidewalk stretches into the midground, where several individuals, primarily men in suits, walk away from the viewer towards a building entrance under a gold-framed canopy labeled "THE MARK" to the mid-left. The building facade on the mid-right features dark windows displaying "KRISPIJ" and "THE MARK," with black awnings and potted green topiaries. A black and white striped pedicab structure is partially visible on the far left foreground.

As the frames progress, the camera moves forward along the sidewalk, maintaining the brown-coated person mostly centered. The black and white striped pedicab structure on the far left recedes further out of the frame. Several people previously walking ahead move further into the distance or enter the building on the right. A person in a black outfit becomes more prominently visible standing near the entrance of the building on the right, as more of the outdoor dining area, including additional tables and chairs, is revealed to the right of the foreground person.
