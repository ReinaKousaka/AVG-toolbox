The first frame shows a rainy street scene with a large tree trunk partially obscuring the lower-left. A crosswalk with white stripes extends horizontally across a wet, dark asphalt road in the mid-ground, bordered by a yellow line. To the right, a wet brick sidewalk with yellow tactile paving leads past a utility pole with black and yellow stripes, towards a person holding a bright green umbrella who is walking away from the viewer. In the background, buildings with storefronts line the street, featuring a parked scooter and a white car moving away from the viewer on the road.

The white car on the road recedes into the background, moving further away from the viewer. Concurrently, the person with the green umbrella walks further away from the viewer along the right-side sidewalk. A small white truck then appears in the far distance, also moving away from the viewer along the road. Subsequently, a dark vehicle is revealed even further back on the road, behind the white truck, continuing to recede from view. The heavy rain visibly persists throughout the entire sequence.

The first frame depicts a rainy urban street, featuring a wet asphalt road with a pedestrian crossing foreground left, and a striped pole with a partial green umbrella foreground right. A white scooter is parked on a red bike lane to the left, with storefronts beyond, while a white pickup truck approaches in the midground and a black pickup truck is visible receding on the right.

In subsequent frames, the white pickup truck steadily moves closer to the viewer from the midground, enlarging as it progresses, while the black pickup truck continues to recede further into the distance on the right. Concurrently, the green umbrella visible in the foreground right of the initial frame disappears from view.
