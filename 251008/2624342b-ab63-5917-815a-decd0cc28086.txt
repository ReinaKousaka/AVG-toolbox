The first frame depicts a wide urban street receding into the distance, lined by multi-story buildings on both sides. To the left, a row of shops with bright signs and some outdoor food stalls are visible at street level, backed by residential floors with balconies, while on the right, a modern building with horizontal slats and a parking entrance is seen, alongside a dark signpost with a directional arrow and a 'P' symbol. Several pedestrians are scattered on both sidewalks and in the distance on the street.

Throughout subsequent frames, pedestrians on both the left and right sidewalks continue to move further into the scene and closer to the viewer. A light blue scooter emerges from the distant background on the left side of the street, traveling towards the viewer and eventually passing by. The person in the dark jacket initially on the left sidewalk moves further down the street, deeper into the shop area.

The first frame depicts a street scene flanked by buildings under a bright sky. To the immediate right, a black signpost indicating "停车场" (parking lot) is visible, with a dark grey car parked just behind it. On the left side of the road, a scooter with a rider is moving towards the viewer, adjacent to storefronts such as "老武汉砂锅粥" and "EYES ON ME," and a street vendor with a white display case. Further down the street on the left, another vendor is covered by a prominent orange umbrella. Pedestrians are seen on both sidewalks and in the distance, where more buildings line the receding street.

A scooter with one rider, initially on the left side of the road in the mid-ground, moves towards and then past the viewer, exiting to the viewer's immediate left. Subsequently, a new scooter carrying two riders appears further down the street on the left, approaching the viewer. This second scooter travels closer, passing the street vendors on the left, and then also moves past the viewer's immediate left. Finally, a third scooter with a helmeted rider emerges from the background of the left side of the street. This last scooter approaches the viewer, passing the orange umbrella vendor on the left, and comes into the immediate foreground on the left side of the road.
