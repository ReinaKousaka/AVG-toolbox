The first frame presents a nighttime street scene filled with numerous pedestrians on a paved thoroughfare, flanked by illuminated multi-story buildings housing shops like 'BOSS' on the left and 'Nespresso' on the right. An ornate, illuminated Christmas decoration hangs prominently on the far right, with smaller white snowflake decorations receding down the street, while a woman in black walks away in the foreground left near a public bin.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the various pedestrians dynamically shift their positions, constantly entering from the midground and background, moving across the viewer's path, and exiting to the left and right, relative to the stationary buildings and decorations. The woman in the foreground left moves entirely out of the frame to the left, replaced by other individuals, while new groups of people emerge from the midground right, progressing closer towards the immediate foreground right of the viewer's perspective.

The first frame presents a nighttime street scene, looking down a wide pedestrianized shopping street flanked by multi-story buildings. A black and pink public bin with "PEOPLE MAKE GLASGOW" text stands in the far left foreground. The street is paved with light-colored blocks and populated by numerous pedestrians walking in various directions, with illuminated storefronts on both the left and right sides extending into the distance. Buildings with ornate architectural details line the street, featuring bright window displays, while festive, star-like white lights adorn lampposts along the right side, extending into the distant, dark sky.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the street remains constant while the pedestrians are dynamically in motion. A group of two women, initially in the mid-right foreground, approaches the viewer and then exits towards the far right. Simultaneously, another pair of women, slightly to their left and holding cups, approaches the viewer from the mid-right before passing into the left foreground. Other individuals, such as a woman in a cream coat on the mid-left and a man in a dark suit on the mid-right, recede further into the background, illustrating continuous pedestrian flow relative to the static first-frame viewpoint.
