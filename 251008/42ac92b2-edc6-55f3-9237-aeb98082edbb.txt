The first frame depicts a narrow, paved alleyway flanked by stone buildings under a clear blue sky. To the immediate right, a rough stone wall with a wooden window opening is prominent, while a taller, two-story stone building with a street lamp and several windows stands further back on the right. On the left, another stone building extends into the background, forming the opposing side of the alley, where a dark bollard marks the center of the path.

The subsequent frames show the viewer moving forward into the alley and rotating slightly left relative to the first-frame viewpoint. This movement progressively reveals a new arched window and a short metal fence on the lower portion of the right-hand building, previously obscured by the foreground wall. Additionally, more windows of the left-hand building, which feature green frames, become clearly visible as the initial foreground wall on the right recedes out of view.
