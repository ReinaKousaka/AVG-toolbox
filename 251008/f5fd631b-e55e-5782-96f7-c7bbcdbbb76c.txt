The first frame presents a sunlit outdoor scene, with a concrete sidewalk extending from the foreground into the distance. To the immediate left, a blue utility box adorned with a colorful drawing rests beside a low stone wall, which is topped by a cream-colored wall with posters and draped with green foliage. On the right, two dark public trash bins and a partially visible green bin are positioned near a light pole displaying two blue banners with Chinese text, beyond which a line of green bushes and trees separates the sidewalk from a paved road. In the mid-ground on the road, a green city bus is visible, with more trees lining the street in the sunny background.
end of description
The viewpoint consistently moves forward along the sidewalk and slightly to the left through the subsequent frames. The blue utility box progressively exits the frame to the far left, revealing a stone staircase that emerges behind it. Concurrently, a new blue and white poster featuring "96110" becomes clearly visible on the cream-colored wall above this newly revealed staircase. The distant green city bus on the road subtly increases in apparent size, indicating the viewer's forward progression towards it.

In the first frame, stone steps and a light yellow wall with a stone base rise to the immediate left, displaying a blue-topped poster near the foreground. A paved sidewalk with tactile strips extends forward, flanked on its right by green bushes and trees, while a road with a green bus and a distant blue banner occupies the right side of the frame.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the poster on the left wall to gradually exit the frame to the left. Simultaneously, the green bus on the right side of the road appears to recede further into the background. Subsequently, a person wearing an orange vest emerges far down the left sidewalk, advancing towards the viewer's original position.

A sunlit paved sidewalk extends into the distance, featuring a textured yellow strip on its left. To the left, a stone and beige wall runs parallel, while on the right, manicured bushes and trees with white-painted trunks line the path. Further ahead on a street to the right, a green bus is visible, and a person in an orange vest walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk in the midground.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the sidewalk. The green bus continues its leftward journey across the street, gradually moving from the mid-right towards the center of the first-frame's view. Simultaneously, the person in the orange vest recedes further into the distance along the path ahead. As the viewer advances, previously more distant parts of the stone wall and sidewalk are revealed to be directly to the left and in front of the viewer's progressing position.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A paved sidewalk extends from the foreground into the distance, bordered on the left by a stone wall with a white upper section and ivy, and on the right by green hedges and several trees with light-colored bark. A person wearing an orange top walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk in the mid-ground, while a green bus is partially visible on a road to the far right, behind the trees.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves steadily forward along the sidewalk from the initial viewpoint. The person ahead on the sidewalk recedes further into the distance, becoming smaller and almost out of sight, and the green bus on the far right also moves further away, revealing more of its rear as it recedes from the first-frame position.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
A sidewalk stretches into the distance, bordered on the left by a stone wall with a white upper section adorned with decorative openings and climbing vines. On the right, green bushes line the path, with a prominent light-barked tree featuring multiple branches in the mid-right. A person in an orange vest walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk in the mid-distance to the left, while a blue bus is partially visible on the road behind the bushes and tree to the right, beyond the sidewalk.
end of description
The person in the orange vest continues walking further away along the sidewalk, moving deeper into the scene on the left. Concurrently, the bus on the road to the right progresses forward, revealing its full green-teal side as it moves away from the viewer, maintaining its position to the right of the original viewpoint. Eventually, a white vehicle briefly appears behind the receding bus in the far distance, still situated on the right side of the road.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The viewer is on a sun-dappled sidewalk, with a stone and white wall extending along the left side. To the right, a large tree with a white-painted base stands beside green bushes, while a parallel road features a green bus moving away from the viewer. Further ahead on the sidewalk, a person in orange walks away from the viewpoint.
end of description
The green bus continues to move away on the road, and a black car emerges behind it, then overtakes it, also moving away from the viewer. Subsequently, a white SUV appears behind the black car, proceeding to pass it as it moves further away. The person on the sidewalk consistently walks further from the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a sidewalk extending away on the left, bordered by a stone wall, while a large tree with a white-painted base is prominent in the foreground right. Further down the sidewalk, a person in an orange vest walks away near two dark green bins, with a street to the right featuring a white car and a green and blue bus, both moving away from the viewer.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the person in the orange vest continues walking further away along the sidewalk. Simultaneously, the white car on the street overtakes the green and blue bus, which then also gradually moves further away from the viewer.
