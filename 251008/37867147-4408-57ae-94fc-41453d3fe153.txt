The first frame captures a bright blue sky above rugged mountain terrain, with a large, reddish-brown rocky cliff face, heavily covered in green and yellow-green vegetation, dominating the right side from the mid-ground to the foreground. To the left and behind this prominent cliff, a steep, greener mountain slope descends into a hazy valley visible in the distant background, with a hint of a road at the very bottom.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily moves forward and subtly turns to the left, causing the large cliff on the right to recede and shift further towards the right edge of the frame. Simultaneously, the valley and more distant mountains, initially obscured behind and to the left of the first-frame cliff, become progressively more visible and expansive, opening up a wider view of the landscape further to the left of the original viewpoint. The road at the bottom also recedes, indicating continuous forward motion through the mountainous canyon.
