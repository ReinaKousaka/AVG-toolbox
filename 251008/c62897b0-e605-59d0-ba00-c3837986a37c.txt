An aerial view captures a city plaza with a large, L-shaped red-brick building featuring a grey roof on the left. To its right lies a paved plaza adorned with numerous light-colored tables and a conical green structure centrally located, bordered by another multi-story building with a red roof further back. Surrounding these central elements are various urban buildings and streets with parked cars, extending into the distance under a clear sky.

The viewpoint subtly shifts, slightly panning left and zooming out, revealing more of the street and parked vehicles to the left of the large brick building. This movement also expands the visibility of the white-roofed buildings in the immediate foreground, widening the overall scene from the first-frame perspective.
