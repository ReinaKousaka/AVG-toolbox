In the first frame, two bright green electric scooters are parked on the cobblestone street in the foreground, to the right of the viewer. To the left, a woman in a black top and green pants walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk, alongside a building adorned with a dark awning and lush greenery. The cobblestone street stretches into the distance, with a pedestrian crosswalk visible in the mid-ground and various pedestrians scattered across it, moving further away from the viewer. Buildings line both sides of the street, including a prominent pink building on the mid-right and a building with a green cross symbol (likely a pharmacy) further to the right.
end of description
The woman on the left sidewalk continues walking forward, away from the viewer, moving deeper into the scene. Concurrently, pedestrians in the mid-ground continue their movement, some crossing the street further into the scene while others walk along it, gradually receding. The two bright green electric scooters in the foreground remain stationary throughout the sequence.
