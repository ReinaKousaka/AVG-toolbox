The first frame presents a rainy street scene, featuring a wet road, a bus stop, and vehicles receding into the distance on the left, separated by a black metal fence from a wet sidewalk. This sidewalk extends towards a misty horizon, flanked by a row of trees on its left and a rocky embankment topped with bushes and more trees on its right.
end of description.
As the frames progress, the visible rainfall intensifies, and a distinct reddish-brown stream emerges, flowing along the right side of the sidewalk beside the rocky embankment. A small red object, resembling a fire hydrant, becomes more discernible behind the left-side metal fence, while a "Rain Everyday" watermark appears at the bottom left corner of the screen in later frames.

In the first frame, a wet sidewalk with tactile paving stretches from the foreground. To the left, a rainy asphalt road runs parallel, bordered by a black metal barrier and a red fire hydrant, with distant bus stops and trees. To the right, a rocky embankment supports dense green bushes and trees, with muddy water pooling at its base.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the rainfall fluctuates, visibly intensifying and then diminishing as muddy water continually flows along the rocky ditch to the right. A white vehicle passes on the far left road, while a distant person with an umbrella slowly proceeds along the sidewalk, all within the existing street and park landscape.

The first frame depicts a wet, rainy street scene looking forward. To the viewer's left, a dark metal fence parallels a wet sidewalk and a road, with blurred vehicles and a bus stop visible in the distance. To the viewer's right, a concrete path runs parallel, bordered by a rock retaining wall below which muddy water flows, and green bushes backed by a forest on an incline.
end of description
Rain continues to visibly fall throughout the scene, with water accumulating and flowing along the concrete path to the right and on the left sidewalk. Vehicles, including a bus and cars, pass from the background right to left on the distant road. A person holding an umbrella briefly walks away from the viewer on the path in the mid-distance.
