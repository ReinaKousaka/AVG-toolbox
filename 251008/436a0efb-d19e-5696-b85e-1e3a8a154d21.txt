In the first frame, a bustling city street is viewed from a pedestrian's perspective. In the immediate foreground, a man in a white shirt and glasses holding a phone walks towards the viewer, slightly right of center, while a woman in a black shirt is to his right, also walking forward. The midground features a red-patterned road with a yellow crosswalk, populated by many pedestrians moving in various directions. To the left, a building displays numerous illuminated signs, including a large '금연' (No Smoking) sign, 'BITE,' and food advertisements, with a man in a white shirt and red lanyard standing by a blue bin on the sidewalk. To the right, a yellow-fronted building houses a 'NAISOI' restaurant and a '7-ELEVEN' convenience store. The street recedes into the background, lined with more buildings and signs under an overcast sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The man in the white shirt and glasses, and the woman in black, initially in the foreground, gradually move past and to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, eventually exiting the frame. Pedestrians initially further down the street or to the sides of the first frame appear closer, walking past the viewer's left and right. The '7-ELEVEN' and 'NAISOI' storefronts on the right, and the building with the '금연' sign on the left, move progressively behind the viewer as the scene shifts to reveal more of the street ahead. The street maintains its overall appearance as a busy commercial area, with new sections of buildings and sidewalks continuously emerging in front of the viewer.

The first frame displays a vibrant urban street scene, with a red-paved road and a prominent yellow and white striped crosswalk extending directly in front of the viewer into the mid-ground. To the immediate left foreground, a man in a white shirt with an ID badge holds a phone, partially obscuring grey steps and bins behind him. On the far right foreground, a woman with curly hair in a striped top walks towards the viewer. Buildings line both sides of the street; the left structure features numerous illuminated signs, including "금연" (No Smoking) and "BITE," while the right building has a yellow facade housing a 7-Eleven and other shops. Numerous pedestrians are scattered across the crosswalk, sidewalks, and further down the street, with a motorcycle parked on the left sidewalk in the mid-ground. In the distant background, the street continues, flanked by tall buildings under an overcast sky.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the primary dynamic is the continuous movement of numerous pedestrians. The man on the far left gradually advances towards the viewer, revealing more of the grey steps and bins behind him on the left sidewalk. Simultaneously, the woman on the far right walks forward, eventually exiting the frame to the right. People on the crosswalk move across the street from left to right and right to left, while new individuals emerge from the mid-ground and background on both sidewalks, walking in various directions relative to the viewer. The overall bustling atmosphere of the street remains consistent.
