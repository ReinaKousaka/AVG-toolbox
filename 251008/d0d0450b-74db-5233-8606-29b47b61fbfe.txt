In the first frame, a blonde woman in a black coat and light scarf is prominently visible in the lower left foreground, looking left. Behind and slightly to her right, a group of three people, including a man in a dark overcoat and two women in dark coats, walk towards the viewer on a paved sidewalk. To the far left, several storefronts with illuminated signs, like "JOE & THE JUICE," line the street, extending into the background where more pedestrians are visible. To the right, a wider street with patches of snow and more buildings with glowing windows stretches into the distance, with bare trees bordering the sidewalk.
end of description
The blonde woman in the foreground moves entirely out of the frame to the immediate left. Subsequently, the group of three individuals continues walking past the first-frame viewpoint, with the woman in the puffer coat and the dark-haired woman passing close to the viewer's left. The man in the dark overcoat, now holding a silver bottle, then moves past the viewer's position from the mid-left towards the far left of the frame.

In the first frame, a man wearing a dark coat and patterned tie, holding a white and blue container, is positioned in the immediate foreground on the left, walking away from the viewer with his torso partially visible. He is on a stone-paved sidewalk lined with brightly lit storefronts stretching into the distance on the left. To the viewer's right is a wet street with tram tracks, bordered by buildings with illuminated windows and bare trees, with a patch of snow along the curb. Further down the sidewalk, ahead of the viewer, other pedestrians are visible.
end of description
As the frames progress, the man in the immediate foreground moves further to the left and out of the frame entirely. The entire scene shifts as the viewpoint advances forward along the sidewalk, making previously mid-ground objects appear closer. The two pedestrians further down the sidewalk continue walking away from the original viewpoint into the distance, and more of the street and buildings ahead are revealed.

The first frame displays a nighttime street scene from a low perspective on a wide, paved sidewalk. To the viewer's left, a row of multi-story buildings with illuminated storefronts extends into the background. To the right, a street with visible tram tracks and bare trees, interspersed with patches of snow, runs parallel, beyond which more illuminated buildings are visible. In the midground, two individuals are walking towards the viewer on the sidewalk; one wears dark attire and the other light.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the two individuals on the sidewalk steadily advance towards the viewer, progressively appearing larger in the foreground. In the fourth frame, the person wearing light clothing briefly raises their arms in a gesturing motion. By the final frame, they are significantly closer to the viewer.

The first frame shows two individuals walking towards the viewer on a well-lit paved sidewalk at night. To the viewer's left, a row of buildings with brightly lit storefronts and signs extends into the distance. To the right, a street with tram tracks, a small patch of snow, and bare trees runs parallel, flanked by more illuminated buildings in the background.
end of description
The two individuals continue walking, moving closer to the first-frame viewpoint; the person on the right briefly raises their hands to their head. They then pass by, with the person in the dark coat moving towards the viewer's immediate left and the other person towards the viewer's immediate right. Both individuals eventually exit the frame.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a night street scene with a paved sidewalk, featuring two women in the immediate foreground right, partially cropped, walking away from the viewer. To the left are illuminated storefronts, including one with a red 'T' logo, and to the right, bare trees, benches, and parked bicycles line the street, while distant buildings and lights are visible under a dark sky with a bright circle overhead.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the two foreground women move completely out of view to the right as the camera slowly advances forward along the sidewalk, progressively revealing more of the illuminated street and distant storefronts ahead relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a nighttime city street with a wide paved sidewalk extending forward from the viewer. To the left, illuminated shopfronts line the street, while to the right, a road with bare trees, patches of snow, and distant buildings is visible, along with a bench and parked bicycles on the sidewalk edge. A group of pedestrians is seen walking away from the viewer in the mid-ground.
end of description
In the following frames, the pedestrians continue to walk further away along the sidewalk from the initial viewpoint, gradually diminishing in size. The rest of the scene remains static relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
