In the first frame, a paved driveway in the foreground hosts two cars: a dark hatchback on the left and a blue hatchback to its right, both facing away from the viewer. Behind them, a large house with reddish-brown and natural wood siding over a white base features multiple windows adorned with bright red shutters. In the background, lush green mountains, partially obscured by clouds, rise steeply under a bright sky.

The camera slowly pans left, revealing more of the scene to the viewer's left. A small wooden bench appears on the driveway in front of the house, to the left of where the blue car was initially. Further left, a balcony and a Swiss flag on a pole emerge from the main house, while another small house and more of the steep mountain face become visible. As the camera pans, the rightmost sections of the main house and distant mountains recede from view.

In the first frame, a gray asphalt road with a manhole cover lies in the foreground. To the right, a dark brown, multi-story house with red shutters and a white lower section stands, with a blue car parked directly in front and a black car behind a small, rock-lined flower bed to its left. On the mid-left, a taller, dark brown house with yellow shutters is partially obscured by a green tree, next to a streetlamp pole. In the background, lush green mountains with a visible waterfall or cascade rise under a cloudy sky, and a small red flag is subtly visible between the houses.

The camera slowly pans to the left, causing objects on the right, such as the blue and black cars and the rightmost house, to gradually move out of the frame to the right. Concurrently, the house on the far left and the streetlamp become more central within the frame. More of the expansive green mountains and the valley floor, previously outside the initial field of view, are revealed further to the left. A prominent red Swiss flag and a waterfall on the distant mountain become clearly visible to the left of their initial obscured positions.
