The first frame depicts a cobblestone path extending directly forward from the viewer, bordered by green grass. To the left, several trees and a portion of a yellow-brown building are visible. To the right, an orange dump truck, laden with dark material, moves away from the viewer on a paved road, which is lined by multi-story buildings further in the distance.
end of description
As the frames progress, the orange dump truck continues to move away on the road to the right, gradually becoming smaller as it recedes into the distance. A red and white striped construction barrier appears on the right side of the road, further from the viewer, as the truck passes it. The truck eventually moves out of sight, disappearing beyond the distant buildings on the right.
