The first frame displays a rainy night street scene with a wet, brick-patterned sidewalk on the left, extending from the foreground into the mid-distance, where several parked cars line a building facade. Centrally in the foreground, a dark tree trunk stands, with another partially obscuring the far right edge. A wet asphalt road, reflecting numerous streetlights and distant vehicle headlights, occupies the midground and background, leading towards faint city lights and a blue road sign visible to the right.

In the following frames, a car with bright headlights progressively appears and approaches from the far distance on the wet road, moving towards the viewer's position. Its headlights create increasingly prominent reflections on the glistening road surface as it advances. The steady fall of rain is consistently visible across all frames.
