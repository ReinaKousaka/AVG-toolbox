A paved path extends forward between a multi-story brick building on the right and a lighter-colored building on the left. In the foreground, an ornate black fence occupies the bottom right, while a white railing is at the bottom left, with grass bordering the path. end of description The viewpoint advances along the path. The fence to the right and the initial section of railing to the left recede from the foreground. As the view progresses, utility meters are revealed on the lower left building, and both structures, along with distant trees, appear closer to the original viewing position.

The first frame shows a paved pathway extending into the distance, bordered on the left by a multi-story building with a reddish-brown base and lighter upper levels, and on the right by a multi-story reddish-brick building. Both buildings feature multiple windows, and strips of green grass lie between them and the pathway, with a manhole cover visible on the path in the foreground. In the far distance, a cluster of trees and a bright sky are visible where the path appears to open up.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the pathway, causing the buildings, grass, and path elements to scroll closer and past the viewer. The manhole cover, initially in the mid-foreground, moves towards the bottom-left of the frame and eventually exits the view. This continuous forward movement reveals new sections of the pathway and the lower parts of the buildings that were previously further ahead.
