The first frame displays a bright city scene from a vehicle's perspective on a curving road. In the foreground, a grey concrete barrier delineates the road's left edge, with yellow markings and orange cones on the pavement beyond it. A white car travels ahead on the right side of the road, while to the left of the barrier, a yellow mobile LED sign and a red rectangular container are visible, with a tall white building partially seen on the far left. A prominent street lamp stands near the center, and further back, elevated road structures and distant city buildings are visible under a clear blue sky.

end of description

As the viewpoint progresses, the white car moves further into the distance down the road, which gradually straightens. The construction site elements, including the yellow LED sign and red container, shift to the left and eventually out of the frame. Simultaneously, more of the distant cityscape and complex elevated infrastructure are revealed directly ahead, with a blue portable toilet becoming visible on the far right as the scene advances.

The first frame shows a multi-lane road viewed from a vehicle, leading towards a city skyline under a clear blue sky. A white car is positioned in the lane ahead, moving away from the viewer. Concrete barriers line both sides of the road in the foreground, with a blue portable toilet visible on the far right, beyond the barrier. In the mid-ground, construction sites extend on both sides, featuring pipes and scaffolding on the left and yellow equipment on the right, beneath an overhead bridge. The background reveals a cluster of tall city buildings amidst green trees.
end of description
As the viewer progresses, the white car moves further into the distance while the blue portable toilet on the far right exits the frame. A new yellow mobile sign, complete with solar panels and a speed display, emerges closer on the right. Additional construction vehicles, including a dark van, become more distinct further down the right side of the road. Subsequently, a train briefly crosses from right to left along the mid-ground tracks.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a multi-lane road extending directly forward, bordered by concrete barriers with yellow chevron markers, under a bright blue sky. A white car proceeds in the left lane ahead, while construction areas are visible on both sides with machinery and a worker in orange to the right. A prominent "START VARIABLE SPEED LIMIT ZONE" sign stands to the left, two streetlights arch over the lanes, and in the distance, a city skyline with tall buildings rises above scattered trees.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the "START VARIABLE SPEED LIMIT ZONE" sign on the left recedes to the upper left, replaced by a newly revealed "NO ACCESS FREEWAY ENTRANCE" sign appearing below it. Concurrently, the worker on the right shifts further to the right, and a large grey rectangular construction element emerges and expands on the far left. The white car ahead also appears closer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a multi-lane road viewed from a vehicle under a clear blue sky. Concrete barriers line the immediate left and right sides of the road, featuring white lane markings on the asphalt. Ahead in the midground, a white car is visible, beyond which lies a construction zone with heavy machinery. To the viewer's left, a beige noise barrier partially conceals a parallel road with vehicles and an elevated overpass, while to the right is a construction site with a large white flatbed truck and train tracks. A skyline of high-rise buildings dominates the far background, framed by trees on either side.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewer moves forward along the road. The white flatbed truck on the construction site to the right moves out of view, while the concrete barriers on both sides recede past the viewer. The road to the left becomes more open, revealing several vehicles moving and traffic lights ahead cycling from green to amber. The overhead streetlights and elevated bridge pass directly above the viewer as the perspective advances towards the central construction zone.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a multi-lane road from the viewer's perspective, marked with white lines leading forward. To the immediate left, a separate road with green traffic lights and vehicles like a tow truck and a white car runs parallel, separated by a concrete barrier and topped by a metal gantry structure. On the right, a construction site with heavy machinery, orange barriers, and workers is active. An elevated road crosses the mid-ground, behind which a city skyline of high-rise buildings stands under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As frames advance, the viewer moves forward along the road, making the 'MERGE AHEAD' text painted on the road in front increasingly prominent. A new orange and white regulatory sign, located to the left above the parallel road, progressively enters the frame, eventually revealing the full text: 'LOW TUNNEL CLEARANCE 4.4m NO DANGEROUS GOODS IN TUNNEL' before moving further left. The construction site on the right and the distant city buildings appear closer as the perspective shifts forward.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The viewer is positioned on a multi-lane road, with a "MERGE AHEAD" road marking prominently in the foreground. To the left, a concrete barrier separates the viewer's lane from a lower road featuring several cars and a multi-tiered overpass system above. To the right, yellow and orange construction barriers line the roadside, concealing parked construction vehicles including excavators and trucks, with distant high-rise buildings and more urban infrastructure visible against a clear blue sky.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The 'MERGE AHEAD' marking recedes and eventually moves out of view from the bottom of the frame. The construction barriers on the right also advance, moving past the viewer's position and revealing more of the construction equipment and site. Concurrently, vehicles on the adjacent lower road to the left and blue road signs on a pole on the left approach and pass the viewer's position.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a multi-lane road with "MERGE AHEAD" painted centrally on the asphalt, flanked by concrete barriers. To the left, construction equipment and vehicles are visible on an elevated road, while a construction site with several large excavators (orange and teal) stands behind a barrier to the right, all under a clear sky with distant city buildings in the background.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the excavators on the right gradually recede from view. The blue overhead sign on the left, initially partially visible, becomes fully readable as "NO TAG OR PASS CALL 13 18 65" with "3 DAYS TO PAY" below it. This blue sign then disappears to the left, revealing a new orange sign further ahead on the left that reads "WESTCONNEX TUNNEL SOUTHRAD," as the road approaches a tunnel entrance directly ahead.
