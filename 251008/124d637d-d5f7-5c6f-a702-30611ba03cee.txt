The first frame shows a paved walkway extending forward, with a street and parked cars to the viewer's left, backed by buildings and distant mountains. To the right of the walkway, trees cast shadows over a green space featuring a bench with two seated individuals and a large grassy field stretching towards distant mountains. Above, a cloudy sky completes the scene.
end of description
As the frames advance, the viewer moves forward along the walkway. The two people on the bench and a green trash can to the viewer's right gradually recede and exit the frame. Simultaneously, more of the street, buildings, and the expansive grassy field further ahead are revealed relative to the initial viewpoint.
