In the first frame, a translucent umbrella occupies the immediate foreground left, near a darker umbrella, while a semicircular glass subway entrance is centered in the midground, with a street sign pole standing midground right. A large, vine-covered clock face on a building facade, flanked by benches, is visible in the background right, opposite distant buildings and a wet street in the far background left.

As the camera advances, the foreground left umbrellas move out of view, and the semicircular entrance shifts closer to the foreground left, revealing a bicycle parking sign on its base to the right of its original midground position. Concurrently, the street sign pole moves leftward from its midground right spot, becoming partially obscured, while the large clock and benches, originally in the background right, become larger and closer, and a potted evergreen tree emerges to their immediate left.

A brown-tiled structure with a translucent arched roof and a black sign for 'bicycle parking' is in the left foreground, while a large clock face adorned with foliage and two brown benches occupies the right midground against a building. A wet, reddish-brown pavement leads from the viewer's position past several potted evergreen trees in blue planters located in the left midground. Beyond these, a city street with various buildings and signs stretches into the background under an overcast sky.
end of description
The camera moves forward and slightly to the left relative to the initial viewpoint. The arched structure in the left foreground recedes and eventually moves out of view to the left. Concurrently, the large clock and benches on the right shift further right and appear smaller. A person holding a colorful umbrella, previously obscured, emerges from the distant left midground, walking towards the viewer on the path past the potted trees. The background street scene on the far left also becomes closer and more detailed.

The first frame displays a wet city sidewalk on an overcast day. A translucent-roofed tunnel structure runs along the left, while a wooden bench and a decorative tree with yellow fruit-like objects are on the right, next to a building. Potted evergreens line a raised planter along the reddish-brown path, with people holding umbrellas visible further down.
end of description
Subsequent frames show the viewpoint slowly moving forward, causing the tunnel on the left and the bench and tree on the right to gradually exit the frame. As the perspective advances, the wet path and distant people with umbrellas become more prominent and closer to the viewer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a wet urban street with a dark brown, domed translucent structure occupying the left foreground. To the right, a building wall features potted plants and smaller bushes, bordering a wet sidewalk with additional green bushes leading into the background where distant buildings and streetlights are visible under an overcast sky.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the static urban landscape remains, but several people, mostly carrying umbrellas, are seen walking along the wet sidewalk from the background towards the viewer, positioned between the bushes and the building on the right.

First, the wet city sidewalk is bordered by a dark, curved translucent shelter occupying the left foreground and green potted plants lining a dark building on the right. Pedestrians holding umbrellas walk away from the viewer on the sidewalk, which features rounded bushes in the mid-ground, while a street with traffic and tall buildings extends into the background under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the pedestrians move further down the sidewalk, away from the viewer, while more vehicles, including a red bus, become visible on the street to the left of the pedestrians, moving in the same direction. The viewpoint subtly shifts forward and right, slightly widening the visible street scene.

In the first frame, a rainy urban street scene unfolds under an overcast sky. To the viewer's immediate right, lush green bushes in black planters line a modern building with a dark facade. A wet sidewalk stretches diagonally from the left foreground to the mid-ground, where a group of pedestrians, holding colorful umbrellas (pink, teal, and white polka dot), walk towards the viewer. To the left of the sidewalk, a wet street hosts moving vehicles, including a red bus and a silver car, proceeding away from the viewer. Further in the background, more buildings and trees are visible, with a brightly colored, multi-storied commercial building distinct on the right side of the street.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the group of pedestrians on the left sidewalk, holding colorful umbrellas, continues to move towards the viewer. Simultaneously, the bus and silver car on the wet street to their left proceed further away into the background. A green city bus (initially red in frame one) becomes more prominent as it moves further down the street on the left. Further down the right sidewalk, a new individual appears under an awning and begins walking towards the left. The continuous movement of pedestrians and vehicles maintains the dynamic, rainy city atmosphere.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a wet city street and sidewalk on an overcast day. To the viewer's immediate right, a dark paved sidewalk with several round green potted bushes leads up to a modern building with storefronts. To the left, a lighter-colored sidewalk features multiple pedestrians holding umbrellas (pink, white polka dot, light blue, and dark), running parallel to a street with a green bus, cars, and traffic lights, all under a grey sky with distant buildings.
end of description
As frames progress, people on the left sidewalk, including those with the pink and polka-dotted umbrellas, move further away from the viewer. A woman in a pink top and white shorts, initially partially obscured, walks across the mid-ground sidewalk from left to right, exiting the frame. Concurrently, the green bus and other vehicles on the street continue moving from left to right, revealing more of the street and a blue scooter to the left, behind the initial crowd of pedestrians.
