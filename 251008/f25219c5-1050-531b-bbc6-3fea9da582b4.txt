The first frame shows a scenic village street with towering, snow-capped blue mountains in the distant background under a cloudy sky. In the foreground left, a wooden fence draped in ivy runs horizontally, with parts of a multi-story wooden house visible behind it. To the mid-right, a dark brown wooden house with a white foundation and several windows stands, and a small, round-canopied green tree is situated in the paved area in front of it. Between these foreground structures, a lighter wooden house with a red-tiled roof is visible.
end of description
A white car gradually appears from the mid-right side of the scene, moving leftward along the road in the mid-ground. The car drives past the small green tree, positioned in front of the wooden house with the red roof. It continues its leftward motion, eventually coming to a stop further to the left in the mid-ground, behind the central tree.
