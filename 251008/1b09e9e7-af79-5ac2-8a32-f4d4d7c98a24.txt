A narrow asphalt path leads into a village, bordered immediately right by a low stone wall and left by a multi-story stone building with windows, while a large dense tree rises behind the wall to the right and other stone houses with distant green fields are visible straight ahead under a clear blue sky.

As the viewpoint moves forward along the path, the stone wall and the left-side building appear closer, revealing more of the building's facade, windows, and a light-colored door. The road ahead widens slightly, and a white trailer emerges behind the building further down on the left, while a small figure becomes visible in the far distance, approaching an archway.

A narrow paved path leads directly forward between stone structures. To the left, a stone building features a white-framed window and the upper part of a light-colored door. To the right, a low stone wall runs parallel, with a taller stone building and some trees beyond it. In the mid-ground, a smaller stone building and a caravan are visible to the left, behind another low stone wall, while a distant opening between buildings at the path's end reveals a faint figure.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the path. The light-colored door on the left building, previously partially obscured, is fully revealed. As movement continues, a metal gate, initially hidden to the lower left behind the first building, becomes visible, with a dark car parked behind it next to the caravan. Further progression exposes a second, lighter car parked behind the dark one and two dark trash bins appearing to the immediate lower left, closer to the viewer's initial position.

The first frame shows an asphalt path leading into the distance, flanked by a low stone wall on the right and a metal gate and partially visible gray bin on the left. Beyond the gate, a gray car is parked, and further back, a white caravan sits behind a low stone wall in front of a stone building with a dark roof. To the right, a tall, multi-story stone building with dark windows stands behind the stone wall, with sparse green foliage at its base, all under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the path, the stone wall on the right recedes, while the bin and gate on the left mostly exit the frame. The gray car, initially on the left, moves further left and slightly forward relative to the evolving scene. Gradually, a white air conditioning unit is revealed on the right side of the tall building, previously obscured by the receding wall and vegetation.
