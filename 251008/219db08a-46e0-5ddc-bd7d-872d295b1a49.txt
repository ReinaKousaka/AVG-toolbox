The first frame captures a rainy street scene from a sidewalk viewpoint. In the foreground to the left is a metal fence with orange cones, and a white SUV is visible on the road behind it. Centered slightly right, a small tree stands next to a black utility box, with a wet crosswalk extending to the right where several individuals with umbrellas are waiting. Beyond the crosswalk, a dark van and other vehicles are on the road, while multi-story buildings with various storefronts line the right side of the street, and taller residential buildings appear in the distant left background. Rain visibly falls, creating reflections on the wet pavement.

Subsequently, the white SUV on the left moves forward and exits the frame. The dark van to the right also departs, replaced by a smaller white car that proceeds to cross the intersection. Concurrently, a pedestrian holding an umbrella emerges from near the tree and walks across the crosswalk from the viewer's left to right. Farther back, a black car progresses in the distant left lane.
