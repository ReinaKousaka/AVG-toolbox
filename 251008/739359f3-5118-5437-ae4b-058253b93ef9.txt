To the viewer's right, a wet sidewalk parallels buildings with some illuminated elements.

Heavy rain continues throughout the frames, making all surfaces slick and reflective. On the street to the left, vehicles, including a light-colored car then a dark car, sequentially move across the frame, receding into the distance or appearing from it. Additionally, from the third frame, a person with an umbrella emerges on the mid-distance sidewalk to the right, walking away from the viewer before disappearing from view by the final frame.

The first frame captures a rainy night street scene, with a prominent tree trunk in the foreground-left. To its left, a wet street reflects distant building lights, where a black SUV is parked, and another vehicle is further back. To the right of the tree, a wet sidewalk stretches into the distance, bordered by a building with illuminated facades and several smaller trees.

As frames progress, a white car drives into view from the far left, moving across the wet street behind the foreground tree. The parked black SUV's taillights briefly illuminate, and a red fire hydrant becomes distinctly visible on the curb next to the tree. The continuous heavy rain intensifies the reflections on all wet surfaces, while the overall viewpoint remains static.

The first frame displays a rainy city street at night, with a black SUV parked on the wet asphalt to the viewer's left, beside a red fire hydrant on the curb. A prominent tree trunk stands in the center foreground, separating the street from a wet sidewalk on the right, which is lined by a building featuring warmly lit windows and decorative potted plants.

In subsequent frames, the black SUV's brake lights briefly illuminate. The rain visibly intensifies, showing more distinct streaks across the scene from approximately frame six, while a white car moves further down the wet street into the distance.
