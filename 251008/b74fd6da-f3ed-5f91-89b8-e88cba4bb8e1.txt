In the first frame, a green costumed character, resembling a leaf or alien, stands on the far left foreground, facing right. Ahead of the viewer in the near foreground, a man in a dark coat and a woman in a purple coat walk away. To the left midground are several yellow taxis and a green bus, with a yellow taxi sign on a pole. In the center midground, a food cart with a blue and yellow umbrella, displaying "SABRETT" and "NICE RICE," is visible. A large classical building with numerous columns spans the background from left to center, with a modern skyscraper to its right. Further pedestrians and yellow taxis are visible on the right midground and background.

The two people in the foreground walk progressively further away from the viewer. Simultaneously, the green costumed character on the left side adjusts its pose, raising its left arm and then lowering it. Other pedestrians on the right side of the frame continue moving away from the viewer, with some entering from the right edge and others exiting. The vehicles and food cart remain largely stationary throughout the sequence relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a busy city scene with numerous pedestrians on a paved surface in the foreground, including a central trio walking away from the viewer. In the midground, a food cart with a blue and yellow umbrella is flanked by several yellow taxis and a green bus. A large classical building with columns, marked as Moynihan Train Hall, spans the background, with taller structures to the far right.

Subsequent frames show the foreground pedestrians continuing to move away from the viewer, while a green bus in the midground gradually shifts left, revealing more parked yellow taxis behind it. Additional pedestrians also become visible, traversing the midground from right to left.

The first frame presents a bustling city street scene with a wide concrete sidewalk occupying the foreground. On the left, a food cart with a blue and yellow 'Sabrett' umbrella is visible, while behind it and extending across the midground are multiple yellow taxis and a large green bus. Pedestrians walk across the sidewalk from various directions, with two individuals in dark coats prominent in the lower left, moving towards the left. In the background, a grand classical building with numerous columns spans the scene, featuring a "MOYNIHAN TRAIN HALL" sign on its far left.
end of description
Following the first frame, the pedestrians on the sidewalk continue their movement; the couple in the foreground progresses towards the left, eventually moving further left and slightly out of the frame. Other individuals in the midground walk both left and right, with some new pedestrians entering from the far right and others exiting left. Additional yellow taxis are revealed to be slowly driving or stopping in the street behind the main group of pedestrians, to the left and center. The background buildings and stationary structures remain fixed relative to the viewpoint.
