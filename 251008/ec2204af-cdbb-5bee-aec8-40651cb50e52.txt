In the first frame, a wet, reflective city street at night is visible, with a person holding a black umbrella standing on the left, next to another person holding a pink umbrella. Behind them are yellow and black construction barriers in front of a modern building with reflective glass windows. To the mid-right, several pedestrians with dark and red umbrellas walk away from the viewer down the brightly lit street, flanked by tall buildings adorned with neon signs.

As the video progresses, a new pedestrian holding a white umbrella emerges from the left foreground, walking towards the right side of the frame, passing closer to the viewer. This person, wearing a black top and pants, walks past the two stationary individuals on the left with the black and pink umbrellas. The group of pedestrians in the mid-ground continues walking further away, maintaining their positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint as the individual with the white umbrella moves across the foreground.
