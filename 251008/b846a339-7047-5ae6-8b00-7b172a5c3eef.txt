The first frame displays train tracks stretching forward under a clear blue sky, bordered by gravel and green grass. To the left, a road runs parallel with two parked cars, leading to houses set against distant mountains, while to the right, dense green bushes partially obscure a light-colored house and a tall utility pole.

As the viewpoint progresses forward, the house on the right becomes fully visible, revealing its multi-story structure and windows, while the utility pole moves to the far right. Simultaneously, the cars on the left pass out of view, revealing a prominent white house with blossoming trees to the far left. Further along, a speed limit sign marked "25" appears on a pole to the right, as the previously revealed house on the right completely recedes, unveiling a cleared area and more trees.

The first frame displays a train track receding into the distance, slightly curving to the right, flanked by green grassy areas. To the left, a light-colored house with a dark roof and shutters is partially obscured by a graffiti-covered concrete structure in the foreground, with mountains visible in the far background. To the right, a grassy bank features trees, some bare and some budding with spring leaves, while a white concrete block rests in the lower right, and overhead wires span a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the graffiti-covered concrete structure and the white block recede from the foreground and eventually out of view. The initial house on the left moves past, revealing a taller, darker building behind it, while a utility pole carrying a "75" speed limit sign emerges on the right and passes by. Further along to the right, a road with a visible car is revealed in the mid-distance.
