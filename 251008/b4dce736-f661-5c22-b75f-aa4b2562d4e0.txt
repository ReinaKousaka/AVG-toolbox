A river flows centrally with a large arched concrete bridge spanning its upper left, while traditional buildings line the far bank to the right, under hazy distant hills. In the foreground, a decorative stone walkway with railings is on the left, and a large wooden waterwheel is positioned to the right, partially submerged in the river.
