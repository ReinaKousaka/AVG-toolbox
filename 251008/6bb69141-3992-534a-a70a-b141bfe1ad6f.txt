The first frame depicts a wet, cobblestone street at night, reflecting bright lights from buildings and overhead string lights. On the left, a light-colored stone building has a graffiti-covered doorway and two windows, with a metal railing at the lower left. Adjacent to it, a darker stone building houses a shop with a gray facade and white windows, bearing a "Pure Smart Factory" sign. Further down the street on the right, additional buildings with outdoor seating and blue barriers are visible, as several people, including one with a white umbrella, walk away from the viewer into the illuminated distance.

Over the subsequent frames, the people visible on the street consistently move further away from the viewer. The individual holding the white umbrella, followed by the person in the red skirt, recedes into the background past the outdoor seating areas. The third person also continues walking away, deeper into the street from the initial viewpoint.

In the first frame, a wet, cobbled street stretches away from the viewer, flanked by stone buildings under a dark night sky. To the left, a multi-story building features a ground-level shop with a dark facade, a "Rose Street Barbers" sign, and a graffiti-covered doorway next to it; a street lamp illuminates this side. To the right, another building houses a blue-fronted establishment with outdoor seating areas marked by blue "Heineken" barriers. Overhead, string lights illuminate the street, reflecting off its wet surface where several people are seen walking away from the viewer in the midground, one carrying a white umbrella.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly pans to the left, causing the buildings and street on the right to become slightly more prominent relative to the viewer's original position. Simultaneously, the group of people, including the one with the white umbrella, continues to walk further away down the street, receding into the distance from the first-frame viewpoint. The barber shop sign also appears to shift slightly left relative to the frame.
