As the frames progress, the initial group of people continues to walk further into the distance along the alleyway. Concurrently, a new couple, consisting of a man in a pink shirt and a woman in a light dress, appears from the mid-ground right and steadily walks closer towards the viewer. They pass the other group and move into the foreground, approaching the immediate right side of the initial viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a narrow, sunlit urban alleyway flanked by buildings. On the left, a beige wall features a large notice board displaying "Velo" and a menu with food images and text, alongside a yellow bicycle component at the bottom. To the right, a dark shopfront with glass windows lines a stone pavement extending into the distance, where a group of four people walks away from the viewer, cast in sunlight and shadow. In the immediate foreground-right, a man in a pink shirt and sunglasses walks towards the viewer, accompanied by a woman in a white dress slightly behind him.

The man in the pink shirt and the woman in the white dress on the foreground right steadily walk past the viewer, eventually exiting the frame to the right. Simultaneously, the group of four individuals in the midground continues to walk further down the alley, receding into the distance. Over time, the content on the notice board on the left wall changes from a menu to a collection of different posters, primarily in yellow and blue hues. The red sign above the shop entrance on the right also becomes clearer, revealing the word "Ristorante."
