The first frame depicts a very blurry, long-exposure night scene of a city street, featuring a road extending into the distance, bordered by sidewalks and multi-story buildings. Yellow construction barriers are prominently visible along the right sidewalk in the midground, while a hazy McDonald's arch and a red metro sign appear further down the central street, all enveloped in significant ghosting.
end of description.
The subsequent frames dramatically clarify the scene as the blur and ghosting vanish. The construction barriers on the right are entirely removed, revealing an active sidewalk with trees, outdoor cafe seating, and pedestrians to the viewer's right. Simultaneously, the indistinct McDonald's arch transforms into a clear sign integrated with a metro entrance (Catalunya) on the left of the road, while parked motorcycles become visible on the left foreground sidewalk, displaying the full bustling street.

The first frame depicts a night city street scene with tiled pavement in the foreground. To the viewer's left, a McDonald's subway sign and a glass barrier reveal a street beyond with parked cars and multi-story buildings. A grey utility box stands near the pavement's center-left, while an outdoor dining area under trees and illuminated store facades line the right side, extending into the midground.

As the viewpoint subtly moves forward, objects on the left like the McDonald's sign and glass barrier slowly recede, and the utility box progresses further left and away from the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the outdoor dining area and shop fronts on the right also recede, revealing more of the street ahead, with people on the sidewalk gradually moving further into the distance relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a vibrant night scene on a city street, with a graffiti-covered utility box in the foreground-left and a paved sidewalk extending into the distance. To the left, a street with parked cars runs alongside a building, while the right features a storefront with a large poster; in the middle-ground, numerous people dine at outdoor restaurant tables under umbrellas along the left side.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly shifts forward, causing the utility box to recede from the immediate foreground-left and revealing more of the street, parked cars, and trash bins further left. As the perspective advances, the storefront on the right also reveals additional details, while people on the sidewalk and at the restaurant tables show minor movements, maintaining the bustling atmosphere.
