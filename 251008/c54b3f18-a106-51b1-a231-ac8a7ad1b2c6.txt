The first frame shows a snow-laden street leading away from the viewer, with cleared asphalt in the center. Snow banks line both sides, obscuring parked cars on the left where a large white building with smoke rising from its chimney stands, and a cream-colored building is partially visible to the right behind a snow-covered tree.
end of description
A person in a yellow jacket then appears to the mid-left, beside the snow mound. The viewpoint shifts slightly forward, revealing more of the cream-colored building's roof on the right and a black van further down the road on the right, previously obscured. The person on the left disappears as the viewpoint continues to advance, revealing a 'K' road marking directly in front of the viewer and a dark car now parked further down the road on the left.

The first frame depicts a snow-covered street splitting into two paths, with a large white building featuring green shutters prominently on the left. Snow-laden trees line the right side of the main street and partially obscure another building on the far right, while a street light stands slightly right of center. Further down the main street, other buildings and parked cars are visible, and smoke emerges from the chimney of the white building on the left under an overcast sky.
end of description
The viewpoint gradually moves forward and slightly right relative to its initial position. A dark-clad person emerges from behind the snow-covered bushes on the left sidewalk, in front of the white building, and walks leftwards further along the sidewalk. The plume of smoke from the chimney continues to billow and dissipate, while the road markings in the foreground become clearer.

In the first frame, a snow-covered road curves from the immediate left foreground into the middle ground, marked with white dashed lines. To the road's left is a snow-covered path, and to its right, a snow-laden hedge borders a sidewalk where a person in a dark jacket walks away from the viewer in the middle-right. A prominent white three-story building with green-shuttered windows and smoke rising from its chimney stands in the middle-right, behind the hedge. Heavily snow-covered trees are visible in the middle and background, especially to the left of the main building and further down the road, with additional distant buildings and parked cars on the far right. Streetlamp posts are positioned on the far left and far right sides of the frame.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road and slightly to the left. A new building emerges and becomes increasingly visible in the foreground and middle-left, positioned to the left of the initial streetlamp, which now moves towards the center-left. The person on the right sidewalk continues walking away from the viewer, moving further into the middle ground. The large white building on the right appears to recede slightly, revealing more of its side, while the streetlamp on the far right gradually exits the frame. Objects further down the road on the right become more distant and less distinct.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a snow-covered street with cleared asphalt in the center. Tall apartment buildings flank both sides, partially hidden by heavily snow-laden trees and bushes lining the sidewalks. A person walks away on the right sidewalk in the foreground, while another is visible in the distant background on the curving road under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the person on the right sidewalk gradually walks further away and exits the frame to the right. The buildings on either side recede as the viewpoint progresses down the snowy road, revealing more of the distant landscape.
