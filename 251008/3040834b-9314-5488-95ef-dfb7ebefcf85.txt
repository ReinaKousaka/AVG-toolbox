In the first frame, two large, dark brown pillars flank the viewer, with one on the far left and another on the far right. Between them, a bustling market scene unfolds, featuring several market stalls with yellow and black awnings on the mid-left, displaying various goods, and a white tent stall with clothing racks on the mid-right. Behind the left market stalls and extending into the background is a large building with a textured green facade, while a black truck is parked behind the right tent stall. Numerous pedestrians occupy the foreground and midground, moving between these structures, with a distant tall tower visible in the background under a partly cloudy sky.

Throughout the following frames, pedestrians actively move across the scene; the person in the blue jacket, initially in the foreground left, progresses further left and away from the viewer. Concurrently, the individual with the black backpack in the foreground right moves towards the far right of the frame, gradually passing behind the large pillar. Other midground pedestrians, including one in striped pants and another in a patterned shirt, walk from the center towards the left, while a person in a black top and light blue jeans also moves from the mid-center towards the left.

The first frame depicts a bustling outdoor market street with a prominent multi-story, green-panelled building to the left, featuring geometric patterns. In the midground, numerous market stalls with distinctive yellow and black striped canopies line the street, displaying products and flanked by large brown pillars in the foreground. Many pedestrians are visible, walking past the stalls, with a distant tower appearing against a cloudy sky to the right.

The subsequent frames show continuous pedestrian movement through the market; individuals walk past the stalls and foreground pillars, entering and exiting the view. The overall crowd slightly increases, with a notable red trolley moving from the right midground towards the background as the scene progresses relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
