In the first frame, a paved road extends from the bottom center into the distance. To the left, a steep, rocky mountain slope, dotted with sparse vegetation and utility poles, rises prominently. On the right, a tall, dark green corrugated fence runs alongside the road, fronted by a metal guardrail. Ahead on the road, a white car is visible, and a blue road sign with white text appears above the green fence in the middle distance. Arid mountains dominate the background, under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the road, the blue road sign on the right gradually approaches and its full text becomes visible, revealing "事故易发路段" (Accident-prone section) in Chinese and Tibetan. The white car ahead maintains its relative distance. The surrounding mountain scenery and the green fence continuously scroll past the viewer, indicating ongoing movement through the mountainous terrain.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a paved two-lane road extending forward, flanked by a steep, barren mountain slope on the left and a tall, dark green corrugated fence on the right, separated by a metal guardrail. Power poles with wires ascend the left slope, and a white SUV approaches the viewer in the middle of the road, while distant mountains rise under a cloudy sky.
end of description
The white SUV progresses from the mid-ground, passes the viewer, and disappears behind the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, blue rectangular signs with white Chinese characters become visible on the green fence to the viewer's right, moving from the distance to the foreground and eventually out of frame. The surrounding mountain landscape on the left and the fence on the right continuously reveal new sections as if the viewer is moving forward.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a dark asphalt road stretches forward from the viewer's position, leading into a mountain pass. To the immediate right, a metal guardrail runs parallel to the road, beyond which stands a tall green temporary fence featuring blue and white signs with Chinese characters. On the left, a steep, reddish-brown rocky mountain slope, sparsely covered with bushes and dotted with utility poles, rises prominently. A small, dark, box-like structure is visible on this left slope in the mid-distance. In the background, further rugged mountains with lighter, yellowish hues frame the scene, meeting a cloudy sky overhead.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the green fence on the right progressively reveals new sections with blue and white signs displaying additional Chinese characters. Gradually, yellow and black construction barriers, a red vehicle, and various equipment emerge into view on the right, situated beyond the guardrail. Simultaneously, the rocky mountain slope on the left draws closer, bringing a white circular sign and then a yellow triangular sign into view further along its expanse. The small dark structure on the left slope also comes into clearer focus before receding. The road surface continuously unfolds ahead, displaying varying textures and wet patches as the journey progresses.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a paved road, appearing wet in places, extending from the bottom center into a mountain pass under a cloudy sky. To the left, a light-colored dump truck is parked on a dirt shoulder, with a person standing beside its front, and a circular white sign on a pole visible behind it. The left side is dominated by a steep, rocky mountain slope with utility poles. To the right, a wider dirt area hosts several parked motorbikes, blue bags, and yellow and black striped barriers, with a long green construction fence running parallel to the road against a sunlit, steep mountain face.

end of description

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the road into the valley. The person initially standing near the dump truck on the left side quickly moves out of frame to the left. Subsequently, the yellow and black striped barriers on the far right recede and move out of frame, revealing more of the parked motorbikes and blue backpacks. Both the dump truck on the left and the motorbikes with bags on the right continue to move further left and right, respectively, gradually disappearing from view beyond the edges of the frame. The circular white sign on the left, initially behind the truck, becomes more prominent before also moving out of frame to the left.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a dusty, damp asphalt road stretching forward into a mountain valley under a partly cloudy sky. To the left, a steep, rocky mountain slope rises, featuring a utility pole and a small white sign attached to the rock face further ahead. On the right, a long green corrugated metal fence runs parallel to the road, with two parked scooters resting beside it near the viewer.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the road surface passes beneath the viewer, and the two scooters on the right recede from view, eventually exiting the frame. A yellow triangular warning sign appears more clearly on the green fence to the right, becoming closer to the viewer. Simultaneously, the rocky mountain face and the white sign on the left draw nearer, revealing greater detail as the scene ahead gradually unfolds.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A dusty, partially paved road occupies the foreground and center, curving left into the distance. To the left, a steep, rocky mountain face rises, partially obscured by a green bush in the mid-foreground and featuring a signpost with a blank white sign. To the right, a long green metal construction fence runs parallel to the road, extending into the distance, with a yellow 'S' curve warning sign and a smaller red sign attached to it. Beyond, a valley opens up with more rugged, tan-colored mountains under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the road, causing the initial signpost and bush on the left to recede and eventually exit the frame to the left, while new sections of the rocky mountain are revealed further left. The green construction fence on the right progresses, showing more of its length and eventually revealing a new yellow warning sign depicting falling rocks, which moves closer and exits the frame to the right. The road surface continually changes as the viewpoint advances.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a winding road stretching into a mountain valley. On the left, a steep, rocky mountain face rises, displaying a white information sign and an overhead signpost. On the right, a long green corrugated metal barrier with a red-and-white sign and a yellow falling rock warning sign parallels the road, receding into the mid-ground.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances forward along the road, the white information sign on the left mountain and the warning signs on the right barrier progressively move past the initial viewpoint and out of frame. The green barrier on the right slowly extends further into the distance as the road curves, and a small tree on the left foreground approaches and then moves past the original viewpoint.
