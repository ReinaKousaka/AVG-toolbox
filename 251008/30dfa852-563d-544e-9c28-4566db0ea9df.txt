In the first frame, a woman in a black and white patterned jacket and sunglasses is prominently in the center-right foreground, facing slightly away, with a man in a black hoodie partially visible to her left. Further left and slightly behind them, another man in a white t-shirt is visible. A gray sidewalk occupies the lower left and center, bordering a cobblestone street on the right where a gray SUV is parked. In the midground, a green construction barrier lines the left sidewalk, while numerous pedestrians walk into the distance on both the sidewalk and street, flanked by tall city buildings receding into the background on both sides.

Immediately, the two foreground pedestrians exit the frame to the left, and a new man in a white t-shirt with a small white dog on a leash enters the lower-left foreground, walking forward on the sidewalk. Subsequently, a red and white traffic cone appears on the sidewalk to the left, behind where the man in the white t-shirt initially stood relative to the viewer. The camera then slowly pans to the right, causing the green construction barrier on the far left to gradually exit the frame and revealing more of the street and additional tall buildings further down to the right. As the pan progresses, the man and dog move further into the distance on the left sidewalk, and a white van parked behind the gray SUV becomes more clearly visible. Throughout the frames, more pedestrians are seen moving away from the viewer along the sidewalk and street, traversing the scene.

In the first frame, a city street scene is visible, looking down a narrow corridor formed by tall buildings on both sides. A wide sidewalk occupies the left foreground, featuring a green construction barrier and a building with a green "bread" sign. On the right, a gray SUV is parked in the foreground, with several other vehicles, including a white van and a white utility vehicle, parked further down the street. Numerous pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk in the midground, and towering buildings line the street into the distant background, with patches of sky visible above them.

The camera slowly moves forward, revealing more of the street ahead. The gray SUV on the right gradually moves out of frame, uncovering more of the parked white utility vehicle and a dark sedan behind it. Several pedestrians on the left sidewalk walk towards and past the viewer, exiting the frame.
