A vast, snow-covered mountain range dominates the background under a blue sky with scattered clouds, with a metallic lattice tower standing on a snowy ridge to the right. The foreground features snow-covered ground interspersed with evergreen trees, clustered mainly on the left and center-bottom.
end of description
The viewpoint shifts left, gradually revealing more snow-covered slopes and sparse trees on the right, as the foreground evergreen cluster moves towards the left edge. Concurrently, a cable becomes increasingly visible across the upper left sky, extending towards the metallic tower, and a dark, angled structure appears in the bottom-right corner by the final frame.
