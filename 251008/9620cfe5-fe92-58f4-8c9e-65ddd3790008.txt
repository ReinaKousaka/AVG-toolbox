The first frame depicts a vibrant, bustling pedestrian mall under a brightly illuminated arched ceiling. To the viewer's immediate right, a green-roofed stall displays numerous sunglasses, topped by a large digital billboard showing two people ziplining. A person in a yellow Pikachu costume walks to the left in the left foreground, amidst a crowd of pedestrians filling the wide walkway that recedes into the distance under the glowing neon rings of the ceiling.

In the following frames, the arched ceiling's neon lights dynamically change color, cycling through shades of red, green, and multi-colored patterns like red, purple, and green. The Pikachu character continues to move leftward from the viewer's static viewpoint, and other pedestrians throughout the mall remain in continuous motion. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the large digital billboard and the sunglasses stall consistently retain their initial appearance and position.
