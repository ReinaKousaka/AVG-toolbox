The first frame displays a rainy city street from a low viewpoint, featuring a building-lined sidewalk with a green bike path on the left, and on the right, a wet road separated by a fence, populated by trees and various vehicles, with distant buildings under a gray sky and a large tree trunk prominent in the far right foreground.

Throughout the subsequent frames, vehicles on the wet road exhibit dynamic movement, with a white truck in the mid-ground progressing from right to left. A dark car then emerges from the right side of the frame, moving left and passing behind the white truck, while another white car also becomes visible further right, continuing to move left as the rain persists.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a wet urban street scene under a grey, rainy sky. To the viewer's immediate left, a sidewalk with metal bike racks runs alongside building storefronts, followed by a green-painted bike lane. A line of trees separates this pedestrian area from the multi-lane wet asphalt road on the right, where a black sedan and a white van are visible in the midground, moving away from the viewer. In the foreground to the right, a black metal barrier with yellow details and a utility pole with attached plant pots and traffic lights stand. Tall buildings loom in the distant background.

In subsequent frames, the black sedan and white van on the right side of the road steadily proceed away from the viewer, eventually moving entirely out of frame to the right. A new white truck then becomes visible in the midground on the right, following the same trajectory until it too exits the frame. The visibility of rainfall remains consistent, indicating continuous precipitation throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a rainy urban street scene, with a wet green bicycle/pedestrian path stretching into the distance on the left, flanked by a sidewalk and commercial buildings. To the right of the path, a row of trees separates it from a multi-lane road where several vehicles, including a white sedan, a white van, and a white truck, are seen moving away from the viewer towards the background. Tall buildings are visible in the far distance, partially obscured by the weather. end of description.
As the frames progress, the vehicles on the road, including the white sedan, the white van, and subsequently a dark car, continuously move from the mid-ground towards the right, exiting the scene while revealing new vehicles previously positioned behind them. The rainfall remains consistent, reflecting on the wet road and path, as the overall urban environment and stationary objects remain static relative to the viewer.
