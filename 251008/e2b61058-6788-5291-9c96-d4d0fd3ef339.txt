The first frame presents a vibrant street scene featuring two adjacent storefronts. To the left, a large, colorful witch figurine holding a broom stands beside a black rotating display rack laden with postcards and souvenirs, all positioned on the pavement directly in front of the viewer. Central to the frame is an open pink candy shop entrance, adorned above with oversized lollipops, donuts, and swirly candies, with shelves of sweets and a person visible inside. To the right of the candy shop, a yellow double-doored entrance for "ARABIC STREET FOOD" is visible, and a pink cotton candy machine cart sits on the pavement in front of the candy shop.

In the subsequent frames, the hanging donut and spiral candies above the pink candy shop's entrance are observed to sway gently from side to side relative to their initial position in the first frame. No new objects or scenes are revealed; all other visible elements remain static throughout the sequence.

In the first frame, a colorful witch statue holding a broom stands prominently in the foreground on the left, next to a postcard display. Behind her, a pink building facade features a white awning, beneath which decorative candy shapes like a pink swirl lollipop and twisted white candies hang in the midground, centered above an open candy shop entrance. Inside the shop, numerous sweets are visible, along with a ladder against the right wall, and a pink cart with a metal bowl sits just outside the entrance. To the right of the candy shop, a yellow-doored "ARABIC STREET FOOD" shop is seen, while a grey wall with a 'since 1932' sign is visible to the far left.

The decorative hanging candies in the doorway, including the pink swirl lollipop on the left and the light brown donut on the right, begin to sway. The lollipop swings progressively rightward towards the center, while the donut moves leftward, also towards the center, gradually reducing the distance between them across the subsequent frames. The two twisted white candies hanging between them also exhibit subtle swaying motions.
