In the first frame, a rainy street scene is visible with a white car partially parked on the viewer's right. A man holding a black umbrella stands on the sidewalk to the left of the parked car's rear, facing generally forward. To the left, a red-paved road with dashed white lines features another white car driving towards the viewer, while buildings and trees line the background.

end of description

The white car on the right slowly drives away, moving out of the frame to the viewer's right, and the man with the umbrella follows, walking rightward off-screen. Concurrently, the white car on the red street continues to approach from the left and also moves out of the frame, fully revealing the wet red street and an intersection.
