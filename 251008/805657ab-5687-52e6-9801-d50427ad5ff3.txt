The first frame displays a snow-covered train yard at night, from a low perspective along a track. To the viewer's left, a train with light green containers stretches into the distance, while a dark, textured wall runs parallel to the right. Overhead electrical lines and numerous streetlights illuminate the scene, with distant city lights faintly visible on the far left horizon.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the container train to the viewer's left recedes, revealing an expanding shunting yard area. New objects like a red forklift and additional green containers emerge further left of the original train's position. Simultaneously, the wall on the right continuously moves past the viewer, revealing more of its surface as the train progresses along the snowy tracks into the illuminated distance.

In the first frame, the viewer is positioned above snow-dusted train tracks extending forward, curving slightly right. A tall, rough rock wall runs close to the viewer's right. To the left, a train carrying yellow cargo containers sits on an adjacent track, with more green containers and industrial structures visible further left under bright yard lights against a night sky. Overhead catenary lines span the tracks, and "Vmax Shunting: 30KM/h" is displayed in the bottom left.

The viewpoint moves forward, causing the snow-covered tracks and the rock wall on the immediate right to recede, while the train with yellow containers on the left also progresses forward. A white truck with a flatbed trailer gradually emerges from the left background relative to the initial viewpoint, moving into the mid-ground. As the scene advances, the industrial yard to the left becomes more detailed, revealing additional green containers and structures further ahead. The rock wall on the right continues to pass, exposing more of its surface and an illuminated fixture.

A snow-covered train track extends forward, curving slightly right, flanked by a dark, rocky wall on the right and an illuminated shunting yard with a white truck, various containers, and cranes on the left, all beneath overhead catenary lines at night.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the rocky wall on the right slowly recedes, while the overhead structures with numbers '82' and '12' gradually shift rightward and out of view. Concurrently, the shunting yard on the left, including the truck and containers, progressively moves towards the right, revealing more of the trackside elements behind them. A yellow pole with a red top and light appears on the far left, moving into view and then beginning to pass.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a snow-covered train yard at night, viewed from tracks extending forward. A dark, rocky wall rises immediately to the right, while ahead on other tracks to the right, a train with yellow cargo containers is visible, and a shunting vehicle with a purple light is on tracks to the far left, all under numerous streetlights and overhead power lines.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the rocky wall on the immediate right recedes. A yellow sign marked '470 5' then appears on the right side next to the tracks and moves past the viewer, while the distant cargo train and shunting vehicle on the left gradually approach.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a nighttime railway scene. In the immediate foreground, multiple snow-covered train tracks extend forward, with a main pair curving slightly to the right. To the right of the main tracks, a dark, rocky cliff face runs parallel to the viewpoint, featuring a yellow sign. To the left, a brightly lit train yard or station area is visible, with several buildings, parked railcars, and distant construction cranes. A freight train with yellow wagons is visible further down the main tracks, curving to the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, causing the rocky cliff face on the right to quickly approach, pass, and blur significantly. The distant station and trains to the left also recede relative to the first-frame viewpoint as the camera advances. The yellow freight train ahead on the main track remains in view as the camera approaches it. In the later frames, a yellowish tint and reflective distortions appear across the entire scene, particularly on the right, suggesting glare or reflections from the viewing window.
