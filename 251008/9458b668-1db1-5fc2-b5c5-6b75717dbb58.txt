The first frame shows a sunlit urban street, with a vibrant mural covering a building wall on the immediate left, displaying grey stripes, red circular elements, and blue wavy designs. A concrete sidewalk stretches forward from the viewer's position, flanked on the right by parked cars, including a greenish-silver SUV partially in the foreground and a black Mini Cooper behind it, alongside a tree-lined street and utility poles beneath a blue sky with scattered clouds.

As the frames advance, the viewer moves forward along the street. The mural on the left wall progressively reveals more of its blue wave patterns and striped sections closer to the viewer. Simultaneously, the parked cars on the right, including the SUV and Mini Cooper, recede further into the background, exposing more of the street and new distant vehicles ahead of the initial perspective.
