In the first frame, a white multi-story house with a white porch and stairs leading up from a concrete driveway dominates the center, surrounded by lush green foliage. A dark utility pole with a "HILLSIDE AVE" street sign stands in the right-center foreground, with a large trimmed bush to its left and a grassy lawn to its right and in the lower left. end of description
The following frames show a slow leftward pan, causing the foreground utility pole and street sign to shift progressively toward the right edge of the frame. This reveals more of the sloping concrete driveway and a garage door situated beneath the house's porch on the left. Finally, a dark car appears parked on the street in the far left background, to the left of the house.
