The viewer is positioned on a paved road that gently curves to the right, extending into the distance under a blue sky with white clouds. To the viewer's left, a steep, grass-covered hillside densely populated with trees rises, featuring a white sign on its lower slope. To the right, a thick line of green trees and bushes borders the road, while distant mountains are visible straight ahead between the treelines.
end of description
The viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the initial landscape elements to recede. The sign on the left hillside moves from the mid-left towards the left foreground and then out of view, revealing more of the steep, tree-covered slope. Simultaneously, the dense foliage on the right appears to pass by, revealing new sections of the forested roadside. The road ahead continuously unfolds, with its markings moving from the distance to beneath the viewer, while the distant mountains subtly grow larger as the approach continues.
