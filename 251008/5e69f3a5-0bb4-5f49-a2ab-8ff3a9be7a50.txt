First, a snow-covered forest path extends forward and slightly right, flanked by dense, snow-laden evergreen trees receding into the distance. A large, dark tree trunk stands prominently in the immediate left foreground, with patches of darker, melted ground visible on the path itself.

As the viewer moves forward along the path, the prominent tree trunk on the left exits the frame, revealing new sections of the snow-covered forest ahead. Subtle snowfall intensifies throughout the sequence, with numerous flakes becoming visible against the distant trees as the journey continues deeper into the woods.
