The first frame shows an asphalt road extending into the distance towards lush green mountains under a bright, partly cloudy sky. On the left, a two-story house with red shutters and dense green foliage is visible behind a black fence and sidewalk. To the right, a segmented grey wall runs parallel to the road, with a black street lamp visible further back.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses forward along the road. The house on the left becomes fully visible, revealing its entire facade, a car parked in front, and a flagpole with a red and white flag emerging to its left. Simultaneously, the gridded wall on the right recedes, exposing a paved area and more of the adjacent building, as the street light passes by.

A paved road curves slightly right from the foreground. To the left, a multi-story white building with a dark roof stands behind a black fence, with several parked cars nestled between them. A red and white flag flies from a pole near the far left of this building, while on the right, trees and part of another building are visible. In the background, majestic green mountains rise under a bright, partly cloudy sky with the sun shining from the upper left.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the white building on the left becomes more prominent, revealing a red section further along its side, while the parked cars and initial fence gradually recede and disappear from the left frame. Simultaneously, the building on the right also moves out of view, and the road ahead, along with new sections of roadside shrubbery, comes into focus further down the path.

The first frame shows a paved road leading away, bordered by a multi-story white building on the left with parked cars, and dense green bushes and trees on the right, ahead of a light-colored building. A bright, cloudy sky with sun glare illuminates towering mountains in the distant background.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the white building on the left grows larger, revealing its glass facade, and a red building behind it becomes more pronounced; meanwhile, a light pole emerges on the left, an orange traffic cone appears further left, and the green trees and bushes on the right pass by.

The first frame shows the viewer on a paved road extending into the distance towards mountains under a bright, partly cloudy sky. To the left is a large white building with glass facades, alongside a parking lot featuring a white van and other cars. Further ahead and slightly to the left, a red building with white window frames is visible. On the right, dense green trees and bushes line the road, with a small fence at the bottom right.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the foreground elements on both sides, including the white building, parked cars, and trees, enlarge and shift towards the edges of the frame. A blue street sign, "Davoserweg," becomes clearly visible on the right, attached to a pole. The trees on the right also slightly recede, gradually revealing a light brown building further down the road to the right.

The first frame shows the viewer looking down a paved road leading towards distant mountains. To the immediate left, a white SUV is parked, partially obscuring a light-colored building with a covered area housing two white vans, behind which stands a prominent red building with white shutters. To the right, a beige building is partially visible, with a silver sedan and a dark SUV parked in front of it, and a leafy tree branch hangs from the upper right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The white SUV in the left foreground moves out of view, revealing more of the light-colored building and the two white vans parked underneath. Simultaneously, the beige building on the right becomes more fully visible, and the parked cars on the right shift, with new cars appearing further down the road relative to the original viewpoint. The red building on the left also becomes clearer as the viewer approaches.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows the viewer on a paved road extending towards distant mountains under a bright, partly cloudy sky. To the left is a large red building with multiple white-shuttered windows, its lower section grey with a white van partially visible beneath an overhang. To the right, a light brown building stands beside a parking area containing a white car and a dark blue SUV, partially obscured by a low fence.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the white van on the left disappears from view, and more of the red building's lower facade, including a doorway, is revealed. Simultaneously, the parked cars on the right recede, and yellow pedestrian crossing stripes become visible on the road ahead. Further along, a blue pedestrian crossing sign appears on the right near the brown building, as the road leads to a clearer view of an intersection and additional distant structures.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A street scene shows a paved road with a yellow pedestrian crosswalk in the foreground. To the immediate left is a red building, partially obscuring a light-colored building with green shutters behind it, where several bollards are visible on the sidewalk. To the right, a light brown building with a 'Russmattstrasse' street sign is visible, with a hedge and fence running along its base. In the mid-ground, a street branches off to the right, and in the distance, a large gray building is visible behind some trees, with majestic blue-tinged mountains under a partly cloudy sky forming the backdrop. A construction crane is visible against the mountains in the mid-distance.
end of description
The viewpoint shifts slightly forward and to the right. The red building on the far left gradually moves out of frame, revealing more of the light-colored building and a white car parked on the left side of the street. On the right, the hedge recedes, and an upper-level balcony on the right-side building becomes visible. A light-colored car appears parked mid-ground on the left, and a person is seen walking on the far right sidewalk in the mid-background. The street in the foreground also shows a subtle increase in the visibility of its rightward curve.
