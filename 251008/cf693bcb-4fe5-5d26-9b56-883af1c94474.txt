A street with yellow dashed lines extends from the foreground into the midground, flanked on the left by a multi-story cream-colored building with balconies and on the right by trees and a street sign, all under a clear blue sky with distant mountains.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the multi-story building on the viewer's left and the trees and sign on the right recede and progressively move out of the frame's original visible area. Concurrently, new segments of the street and additional buildings previously ahead of the viewer are revealed in the midground, while the distant mountains remain in the background.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame presents a paved road with yellow lines extending into the distance, flanked by a beige multi-story building on the immediate left and a partial red building on the right. In the background, distant mountains with some snow patches rise under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the initial buildings recede, revealing more of the road and surroundings ahead. A traditional brown-roofed building and a white van appear further down the left, while a large blue "Rheintal Reis" bus and a grey container come into full view on the right, having been previously obscured by the closer red building. The scene consistently features distant mountains and a clear sky as the road continues ahead.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a sunlit street extending into the distance, flanked by buildings and trees on either side, with snow-capped mountains visible directly ahead in the background. To the immediate right, a blue "RHEINTAL REISEN" bus is parked, partially obscured by a large gray dumpster in the foreground. On the left, several residential buildings with brown roofs are visible, along with a parked white van.

end of description

As the viewpoint progresses forward along the road, the gray dumpster and the front section of the blue bus on the far right gradually exit the frame to the right. A yellow-and-black striped bollard in the center of the road approaches, moves to the left, and is passed. Concurrently, a pedestrian crossing sign and a bench become fully visible on the right sidewalk, soon followed by a child appearing on that same sidewalk, to the right of the original first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A paved road with a yellow and grey zebra crossing in the immediate foreground, and a black and yellow striped bollard to the lower-left, stretches into the distance towards mountains under a clear blue sky. To the left, buildings with pitched roofs and balconies line a sidewalk, with an orange van parked mid-distance. To the right, a pedestrian walks on a sidewalk alongside parked cars, a wooden bench, trees, and a building with a wire fence.
end of description
The viewer moves forward, causing the pedestrian on the right to recede behind the first-frame's bench and the initial zebra crossing to move behind the viewer. Concurrently, a cyclist is newly revealed on the left side of the road, moving towards the viewer's original position from the front. As the journey continues, yellow Olympic ring markings are revealed on the road ahead, previously out of view. The cyclist then passes the first-frame viewpoint, moving towards the rear-left. The orange van on the left and the parked cars on the right, initially further away, now appear much closer to the viewer's new foreground.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a road stretching into the distance towards mountains under a blue sky, flanked by buildings behind a green hedge on the left and parked cars with trees on the right; a yellow-and-black bollard is central-right in the foreground, with a white vehicle further down the road. end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the yellow-and-black bollard, initially in the foreground, progresses closer to the viewer before exiting the bottom of the frame. Simultaneously, yellow dashed lines become visible on the road surface where the bollard was previously located. The white vehicle, initially in the middle distance on the road, approaches the viewer, while more of the buildings and parked cars on both sides, closer than their initial positions, are progressively revealed. A blue parking sign also emerges on the right side of the road, in the mid-ground relative to the first frame's perspective.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a sunny street scene with an asphalt road featuring yellow dashed lines leading into the distance. To the left, a white car is parked ahead, with a green hedge and a beige building partially obscured by a red-leafed tree further back. On the right, a street lamp stands near a grassy area where multiple cars are parked, with another beige building and a green tree behind them; mountains are visible in the far background.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the white car on the left moves past and then recedes behind the viewer's initial position. Simultaneously, the street lamp and the parked vehicles on the right also move past the viewer's original position, revealing more of the buildings lining both sides of the road. The distant mountains and the clear blue sky remain visible straight ahead as the scene progresses.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on an asphalt road with distinct yellow dashed lines, looking straight ahead. To the left, a light beige building with brown shutters is partially visible, behind which a stone wall and green hedge extend along the sidewalk. To the right, another light beige building with dark windows stands, with a tree and a partially visible black car at its far right. A street light pole is visible on the right sidewalk, and in the distance, an archway frames a view of mountains under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the road, the initial buildings on both sides progressively shift out of frame, revealing more of the street and surrounding structures. On the left, a light blue-grey house behind the first beige building becomes more prominent before also moving out of view. The black car on the far right quickly disappears as the right-side building also recedes. The street light and the distant archway with mountains behind it steadily grow larger, indicating approach. A small white cloud also becomes visible in the blue sky, appearing above and slightly to the right of the street light's pole.
