The first frame depicts a paved path extending directly forward under two parallel concrete bridge structures, with a rocky cliff face to the left and a murky river flowing to the right. Bright sunlight is visible at the far end of the underpass, with green trees bordering the distant riverbank. end of description
The viewpoint progresses forward along the path. A person on a bicycle emerges from the far distance ahead on the path, approaching the viewer. As the bicyclist nears, a small wooden structure is revealed on the left embankment, just beyond a bridge support. The bicyclist then passes the viewer, moving towards the viewer's rear, as the scene gradually advances out from under the bridge into the sunlight.
