The first frame depicts a wet street on an overcast day. In the immediate foreground, the side of a dark gray sedan is visible to the viewer's right. A white SUV, facing the viewer, occupies the mid-ground on the left side of the road, which has yellow dashed lines. Further down, another white car is seen in the distance, while several parked cars, including a black SUV, line the right curb. The left side features a sidewalk with potted green bushes, a row of trees, and buildings, with more trees and a colorful structure on the right.

The prominent white SUV in the mid-ground begins moving towards the viewer and then continues past, exiting the frame to the viewer's left. As it drives, its side and rear become visible, revealing more of the wet road and the potted plants on the left side that were previously partially obscured. All other objects, including the parked cars on the right and distant buildings, remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a wet asphalt street receding into the distance under an overcast sky, with dashed yellow lines guiding the viewer's eye. A sidewalk lined with potted trees is visible on the left, leading to distant buildings, while a row of parked cars, including a black SUV, occupies the right side of the road. A dark grey sedan is partially visible in the immediate foreground to the right, and a white car is seen far down the road.

In subsequent frames, a person holding an umbrella emerges on the distant left sidewalk, slowly walking towards the viewer. Concurrently, a new solid yellow line segment appears to be drawn into existence across the foreground of the wet asphalt, closer to the viewer than the existing dashed lines.

The first frame depicts a wet asphalt street extending into the distance, flanked by buildings and verdant trees under an overcast sky. In the foreground, a dark blue SUV is parked on the right, while on the left, a sidewalk features five potted green shrubs. The road has yellow dashed lines on its left leading towards a white SUV further down, with more parked cars visible on the right side.

Over the subsequent frames, a new white solid line progressively appears across the width of the road in the midground, forming a clear crosswalk that was not fully visible initially. Concurrently, the existing yellow dashed lines on the left side of the road also become slightly longer and more distinct as the crosswalk is completed.
