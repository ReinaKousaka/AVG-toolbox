The first frame displays the interior of a vast cathedral nave, characterized by numerous tall, light-colored columns extending towards a distant arched structure. In the immediate foreground, a whiteboard display and a man in a brown shirt tending to candles on a small table are visible to the right, while a 'SILENCE please' sign and a dark railing are present to the left. Several individuals are scattered further down the long, dark-floored nave.
end of description
The man on the right continues to tend the candles, gradually turning his back to the viewer and shifting his position. Simultaneously, the viewpoint subtly pans forward and to the left, causing the "SILENCE please" sign on the left to move mostly out of frame. A man in a red shirt, initially in the mid-left, walks towards the viewer, passing by the left side of the frame.
