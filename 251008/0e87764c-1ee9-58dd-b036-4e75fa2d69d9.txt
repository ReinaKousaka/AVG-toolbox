The viewer looks forward down a city street lined with tall buildings, featuring a gray road in the foreground. Ahead, a black SUV leads, followed by a dark sedan to its right, and a red truck further down the left lane; construction barriers line the left, while a parked black car and bus shelter are on the right under an overhead traffic light showing green.
end of description
A white van appears in the distance behind the black SUV and red truck, slowly moving leftward relative to the viewer's original position. Simultaneously, the framing subtly adjusts, making a blue building on the far left more prominent and a "ONE WAY" sign on the right traffic pole more visible.

First, a city street unfolds before the viewer, lined with tall buildings under a cloudy sky. On the left are construction barriers, followed by buildings, while a black SUV and a white SUV are ahead in the middle of the road. To the right, a black sedan is parked next to a bus stop featuring a "CHANEL" advertisement.
end of description
The viewer's perspective moves forward, causing the black sedan and the bus stop shelter to exit the frame to the right. Concurrently, a dark grey pole, a manhole cover, and a fire hydrant progressively appear from the right side of the frame, revealing more of the sidewalk and street further ahead relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The black and white SUVs in front also advance further down the street, increasing their distance from the viewer.

The first frame displays a street scene dominated by city buildings under an overcast sky. In the immediate foreground, orange and white striped construction barriers line the left side of the road, behind which a black construction fence is visible. Further forward in the center of the road, a black SUV drives away from the viewer, while a white SUV and a line of other parked cars are positioned along the right curb. Tall skyscrapers, varying in color and design, rise prominently in the background on both sides of the street and directly ahead.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily moves forward along the street. The construction barriers on the left and the parked cars on the right recede from the view as the observer passes them. The black SUV ahead maintains its central position on the road, indicating the viewer is following it. A red truck further down the street behind the black SUV becomes more distinctly visible. Eventually, a pedestrian briefly appears walking on the right sidewalk past the parked vehicles.

A city street stretches forward, flanked by red-and-white construction barriers on the near left and a row of parked cars on the near right, while a black SUV and a red truck are visible further ahead in the lane, all set against a backdrop of numerous tall buildings under an overcast sky.
end of description.
As the viewer moves forward, the construction barriers on the left and the parked cars on the right gradually recede from the frame. Concurrently, a pedestrian emerges from behind the rearmost parked car on the right, walking forward along the sidewalk.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a forward-facing street-level view of a city street bordered by tall buildings. To the immediate left, orange and white construction barriers line the sidewalk, partially obscuring a yellow backhoe and a green tarpaulin behind a fence, next to a blue and a white multi-story building. On the right, a line of parked cars extends into the distance, with a person in a grey shirt and beige shorts walking away from the viewer on the sidewalk beside the nearest dark SUV. A black SUV drives forward in the center lane, followed by a red vehicle further ahead, while numerous high-rise buildings of various colors dominate the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's vehicle moves forward along the street. The person walking on the right continues moving away from the viewer and eventually exits the frame to the right. Simultaneously, the black SUV and the red vehicle ahead proceed further into the distance. The construction barriers and equipment on the left also shift relatively to the center-left, indicating the advancing viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a city street scene from a vehicle's perspective, looking forward. A wide asphalt road extends from the bottom center into the distance, bordered on the left by orange and white construction barriers and a green tarp, partially obscuring a yellow construction vehicle. On the far left, a tall, white multi-story building with numerous vertical windows dominates, while a line of parked cars extends along the right curb, facing away from the viewer. In the mid-distance, a black SUV is centered in the road, followed by a red emergency vehicle, and a white car is parked on the left street parallel to the construction barriers. Multiple large, multi-story buildings, some red-brick and older, others modern and tall, frame the street under a cloudy sky.

end of description
Across the following frames, the white car initially parked on the left side of the road, behind the construction barriers, begins to move forward, progressively becoming more visible as it drives away from the viewer, maintaining its position to the left of the main travel lane. The black SUV and the red emergency vehicle, positioned ahead and centrally on the road relative to the viewer, also appear to inch forward slightly, maintaining their distance from each other. All other parked cars on the right and the surrounding cityscape remain stationary relative to the viewer's forward movement.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a city street lined with multi-story buildings, extending towards a distant urban skyline under a cloudy sky. A white car is parked on the viewer's immediate left, while several other vehicles are parked along the right curb; a black SUV and a red truck are visible further down the street ahead.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera moves forward, causing the parked cars on the near left and right to shift out of view, effectively moving behind the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the black SUV and red truck recede further ahead, and previously unseen sections of the road and buildings are revealed continually ahead of the first-frame's perspective.
