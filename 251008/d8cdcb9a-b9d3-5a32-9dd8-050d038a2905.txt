In the first frame, two escalator handrails are visible in the foreground at the bottom left and right, with a green mat on the floor to the right. A wide, tiled aisle extends into the midground, flanked by a brick-tiled pillar and glass-paned partition on the left and a tall, dark display shelf full of products, plus a counter display with yellow-lidded jars, on the right. Directly ahead in the midground is an archway marked "B1," through which a "sensory aroma" counter is visible, along with a person in a dark jacket facing away to the right of the counter and another person in red further back. Beyond, various shop interiors are faintly seen in the background.

The individual in the red coat, initially in the background to the left of the "sensory aroma" counter, walks forward into the midground and pauses near the counter. Concurrently, the person in the dark jacket, positioned in the midground by the right side of the main aisle, shifts their stance. Another person briefly appears walking from left to right across the distant background aisle.

The first frame captures a mall interior, looking down a tiled walkway from an escalator, showing a glass partition and a white display stand to the left, and a product counter with a stool to the right. Directly ahead, an open archway leads to a black counter labeled "recchia g'museo" in the distance, with two people standing nearby.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward and slightly downward, the escalator treads and the near display objects on both sides recede from view. The archway and the "recchia g'museo" counter become closer and more prominent, while one person near the counter shifts left and exits the scene.

The first frame depicts a wide interior space viewed through an archway between brick columns. A patterned floor extends forward past a 'vecchia e nuovo' counter and a glass-fronted store, with a retail area visible to the left. To the right, two individuals stand behind a counter displaying bottled items. end of description. The person on the far left walks deeper into the background, moving away from the viewer. A new person in a black suit and mask emerges from behind the central 'vecchia e nuovo' counter, walking leftwards across the frame, then deeper into the background and turning towards the right. Simultaneously, one of the individuals on the right shifts their position behind the counter, slightly turning towards the viewer.

The first frame captures a well-lit interior with a geometric floor. In the foreground right, a person in maroon works at a wooden display with oranges, while a person in black walks across the mid-ground, left-to-right, in front of a central glass-paneled eatery named 'vecchia & nuovo' featuring posters. A retail section with glass shelves extends left, and a large dark oven is visible further back to the right.
end of description
As frames progress, the person in maroon exits to the far right, fully revealing more of the wooden display unit and a newly visible red barrier with tables/chairs behind it. Concurrently, the person in black continues walking right, eventually exiting the frame, while a background figure on the far left moves deeper into the scene.
