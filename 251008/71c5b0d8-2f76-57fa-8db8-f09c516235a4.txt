The first frame shows the viewer on a multi-lane road, looking forward under an overcast sky, with numerous tall residential buildings lining both sides of the road into the distance. To the immediate left is a green barrier, beyond which parked cars, utility poles, and more buildings are visible. To the right, a dark grey sedan, a white sedan, and a partially visible grey minivan are in front of the viewer. Overlaid on the image are a circular map in the bottom-left and speed (71 km/h), distance (732 m), time (01:49:22), and coordinates in the bottom-right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's vehicle moves forward, with its speed fluctuating between 71 and 74 km/h while the distance counter changes from 732m to 731m. The dark grey and white sedans in front of the viewer gradually pull ahead. A white SUV on the far left lane moves towards the viewer and then past them, travelling in the opposite direction. Simultaneously, traffic lights visible in the mid-distance on the right side of the road transition from green/yellow to red, indicating changing traffic conditions ahead.

The first frame depicts a multi-lane road extending forward, lined with numerous tall residential buildings on the right and a parallel road separated by a grassy median on the left, all beneath an overcast sky. Cars populate both roads, with vehicles moving away from the viewer in the right lanes and towards the viewer in the left, while a dark car is partially visible to the immediate right. end of description. Subsequently, the viewpoint advances along the road; cars originally ahead and to the right move further forward, revealing new vehicles entering the frame from behind the first-frame viewpoint in the right lane. The green road sign on the right becomes more distinct, and the cars in the left lane also progress closer to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame captures a multi-lane highway from the viewer's perspective, featuring a white car in the front-right lane and other vehicles further ahead on the main road and an elevated road to the left. Tall residential buildings flank both sides of the highway, extending into the distance, and a green highway sign is visible on the right. On-screen overlays display a map, speed, and coordinates at the bottom.
end of description
Subsequently, the viewer moves forward, causing the white car on the front-right to proceed further right and out of view, and a black van initially to the left on the elevated road also moves forward and out of frame. The viewer's speed increases from 76 km/h to 80 km/h before decreasing slightly to 79 km/h. Concurrently, the green highway sign on the right moves further up and left relative to the viewer's path as red lanterns previously behind it become more prominent and then exit the frame.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a straight multi-lane road viewed from a vehicle moving forward under an overcast sky. To the left, a green barrier separates the viewer's lane from a parallel road featuring cars, behind which are tall apartment buildings and power line towers. To the right, additional traffic lanes are lined with numerous high-rise apartment buildings extending into the background, with several cars visible on both sides of the viewer's lane.
end of description
As the vehicle progresses, objects move towards and past the viewer; notably, a white van on the far left and a white SUV on the right advance. A traffic signal on the left, initially showing yellow lights, subsequently illuminates red, while a sign with Chinese characters and red lanterns becomes visible on the right side of the road in the mid-ground.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a multi-lane road from a driver's perspective, with tall residential buildings, streetlights, and red lanterns visible to the right, while a green median separates another road section with a white car, power lines, and distant buildings to the left. Overlaid at the bottom are a circular map, current speed, and GPS coordinates.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, the vehicle moves forward along the road, causing the road markings to recede and cars ahead to advance from their initial positions relative to the viewer. A white sedan on the far left lanes is gradually passed, and a black delivery van (SF Express) appears from behind the viewer, moving forward and eventually overtaking the white sedan on the left. The displayed speed fluctuates between 81 and 86 km/h, and the time advances from 01:49:30 to 01:49:33.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a multi-lane highway from a forward-facing perspective. In the immediate foreground, the road stretches ahead, with a green central barrier and vegetation to the left. Further to the left, behind the barrier, a black van is parked alongside other vehicles and distant apartment buildings, traversed by power lines. Directly ahead in the viewer's lane is a black SUV, followed by a white SUV and more traffic in lanes to the right, where a prominent row of high-rise apartment buildings lines the horizon under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames advance, the viewer moves forward, causing the black SUV initially ahead to progress further in front and slightly to the right, while the white SUV also continues to move ahead. Vehicles previously on the far left, like the black van, are progressively passed and appear behind the viewer's current relative position. Simultaneously, new vehicles become visible further ahead on the road, and streetlights and power lines gradually shift backward relative to the viewer's movement.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a multi-lane urban highway viewed from a moving vehicle. Straight ahead, the road recedes into the distance, bordered by a green median with bushes and a safety barrier to the left, and a paved shoulder with sparse vegetation and more multi-story buildings to the right. Numerous cars are visible on all lanes, both ahead of the viewer and on the opposing road to the left, with a silver car prominent in the right lane slightly ahead. Tall residential buildings dominate both the left and right horizons, with power lines and streetlights interspersed, and a cloudy sky overhead. On-screen overlays show navigation information (bottom left), speed (bottom center), and GPS coordinates (bottom right).

end of description

The viewer's perspective advances along the highway, causing the road ahead and distant buildings to appear closer, while elements like the green median and the silver car initially on the immediate right pass out of view. New vehicles emerge further ahead on the road and on the opposing lanes as the viewer progresses. The vehicle's speed fluctuates between 82 and 85 km/h, and the displayed time updates from 01:49:35 to 01:49:37, indicating ongoing motion. Subtle shifts in the geographic coordinates also reflect the forward movement.
