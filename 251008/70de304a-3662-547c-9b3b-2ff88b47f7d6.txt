In the first frame, a sidewalk extends forward from the viewer. To the immediate left, a person's upper arm and shoulder are partially visible. A long, brick planter wall topped with green shrubs runs parallel to the left, behind which stands a multi-story building with a brown and white facade. Further down the sidewalk on the left, an entrance under an awning is visible. To the right, a street runs parallel, lined with parked cars, the closest being a dark blue van prominently positioned to the right of the viewer. In the far background, numerous tall buildings line the street under a clear blue sky with some wispy clouds.

The viewpoint steadily advances forward along the sidewalk. The partial view of a person on the immediate left of the viewer in the first frame gradually moves out of the frame. The dark van, initially parked to the viewer's right, slowly recedes as the viewpoint moves past its front, eventually revealing more of the street beyond its original position. Simultaneously, pedestrians initially further down the sidewalk approach the viewer's original position, now appearing closer. The street and buildings continue to extend away from the original viewpoint, with more of their lower facades and the sidewalk ahead becoming visible.

The first frame displays a city street with a multi-story building on the left, its ground level featuring a brick wall and hedge, alongside a woman walking towards the viewer on the concrete sidewalk. To the right, a dark van and a red pickup truck are parked along the street, which extends into the background with more buildings under a blue sky.

As the sequence progresses, the woman passes the initial viewpoint, exiting to the bottom-left, while a new person with a dog appears further down the sidewalk from the left, walking towards the original position. The subtle forward motion causes the dark van to recede relative to the viewer's original position, increasingly revealing the red pickup truck behind it on the right.
