The initial frame depicts a rain-slicked city street at night, with a bus stop and illuminated ad panels prominently on the left. On the right, a person sits on a long wooden bench against a building with storefronts, while trees and distant buildings line the street ahead.

Throughout the sequence, visible rain intensifies, causing splashes on the wet street near the bus stop. The person on the right bench shifts their posture, and a vehicle with red taillights briefly passes in the distant street from right to left.

The initial frame depicts a wet, nighttime city street extending forward, featuring an illuminated bus shelter and bare trees on the left, and multiple storefronts along the right, where a person is seated on the sidewalk near a partially shuttered shop entrance.

Subsequently, the corrugated metal shutter of the rightmost storefront completely opens, revealing the shop's interior to the right of the viewer's first-frame position. Following this, the seated person on the right stands up and moves out of view to the right, essentially behind the first-frame viewpoint. As the person departs, a blue bin and a fully extended awning on an adjacent shop become clearer to the viewer's right.

The first frame displays a wet city sidewalk at night, stretching into the distance. To the viewer's right, a brightly lit building features storefronts, one with an awning, alongside stacked blue crates and a white stand in the foreground. On the left, bare trees, a dark kiosk, and a metal railing border a wet street, where a red object is partially visible in the mid-ground.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly moves forward along the sidewalk. Raindrops and streaks on the camera's lens or a window become more prominent and shift across the upper left and center of the view. The red object on the left clarifies into a fire hydrant, appearing closer, and a new white sign becomes visible on the right-hand building, further along the path.
