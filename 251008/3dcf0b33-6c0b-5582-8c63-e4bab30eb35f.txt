The first frame depicts a wet city street on an overcast day, with a yellow pole prominent in the bottom-left foreground, partially obscuring a planter box and a bicycle parked beside a grey building. A utility pole stands mid-right, while several umbrella-carrying pedestrians walk away into the distance on the reflective street, flanked by buildings.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly moves forward and slightly right. The yellow pole then exits left, fully revealing the bicycle and planter box as they recede, while the utility pole shifts right, progressively unveiling more of the street and buildings to the viewer's right as the pedestrians continue walking further away.

A bicycle wheel and handlebars are in the immediate foreground to the left, with a utility pole just right of it. A wet street extends away from the viewer, lined by modern buildings on the left and various structures on the right, under an overcast sky. Three pedestrians holding umbrellas walk away from the viewer down the street, while "富岸大学" is visible on a building in the far background.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the three pedestrians on the street consistently move further away from the viewer, progressing deeper into the scene. All other visible objects, including the foreground bicycle and pole, and the buildings lining the street, remain stationary relative to the initial viewpoint.

A rain-slicked street is framed by modern buildings under an overcast sky. To the viewer's left, a dark grey planter filled with lush green plants sits atop a slatted wall that extends towards the background, bordering a narrow sidewalk. On the right, three individuals walk towards the viewer under umbrellas, with the closest, a man in white shorts, holding a clear umbrella, while a person with an orange umbrella and another with a dark umbrella follow further behind. In the distance, a large building marked "慶應義塾大学" is visible.
end of description
The camera smoothly progresses forward along the street. The left-side wall and fence move closer, growing in prominence and revealing more of their grid pattern. The man with the clear umbrella moves past the first-frame viewpoint to the viewer's left, as the person with the dark umbrella exits the frame to the right, and the individual with the orange umbrella advances toward the viewer's previous position.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a wet, narrow street lined with buildings under an overcast sky. To the immediate left, a dark grey patterned metal fence and a low black brick wall are visible, with greenery and a modern building behind them. Further down the wet street, a person holding an orange and yellow umbrella walks away from the viewer, with another person holding a white umbrella visible further ahead on the left. On the right, residential buildings with distinct architectural features like arches line the street, while a large white building with blue text is in the far background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily moves forward along the wet street relative to the initial position. The metal fence and brick wall on the immediate left recede out of view, revealing more of the continuous green hedge and the modern building that line the left side. The person with the orange and yellow umbrella continues walking further away from the original viewpoint, becoming smaller, while the viewer approaches the location where the second person with the white umbrella was first seen. The buildings on both sides also appear closer and reveal more of their facades as the perspective shifts forward into the scene.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a wet, narrow street receding into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings and dense green hedges on the left, and potted plants and covered objects on the right. In the midground, two figures with umbrellas (one purple, one orange/yellow) walk away from the viewer along the left side of the street. A large white building with Japanese text ("慶應義塾大学") is visible further down the street, towards the background.
end of description
The two individuals holding umbrellas walk further away from the viewer down the wet street. The person with the purple umbrella moves forward on the left sidewalk, progressively revealing a white car parked behind them. The person with the orange/yellow umbrella also advances further into the distance, heading towards the university building in the background.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a wet street reflecting buildings on both sides, with a planter and two people holding purple and yellow umbrellas near a white car on the left, and potted plants and green rolls on the right; a utility pole and a distant large building are visible down the center.
end of description
In the following frames, the person holding the yellow umbrella, initially further down the street, walks away from the viewer, moving towards the distant large building. All other objects and people, including the two individuals on the left, remain in their initial positions relative to the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a wet, narrow street flanked by residential buildings under an overcast sky. On the left, a woman with a purple umbrella stands on a sidewalk lush with green plants, near a parked white car and two modern houses. A utility pole with wires stands in the midground center, while a person holding a beige umbrella walks away from the viewer down the reflective asphalt road. To the right, several houses, one with an arched entrance, line the street, accompanied by stacked green planks and potted plants. In the far distance, a large white building with blue Japanese characters is visible above the street.
end of description
The person with the beige umbrella steadily walks further away from the viewer down the wet street, progressively diminishing in size. The woman with the purple umbrella on the left remains largely stationary throughout the sequence. All buildings and other environmental elements retain their fixed positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
