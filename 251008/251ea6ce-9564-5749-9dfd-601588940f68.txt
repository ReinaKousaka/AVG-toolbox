The first frame presents a city street scene with a paved road in the foreground featuring yellow box junction markings and double yellow lines on the right edge, leading into the distance. To the right, an elevated concrete highway structure curves away from the viewer, with lush green bushes on a concrete barrier beneath it, and a traffic light showing red is visible on a pole to the far right. On the left, a sidewalk with a red fire hydrant precedes a building with a green-accented lower facade and several small trees, while multiple tall high-rise buildings dominate the background; a blue street sign and another red traffic light are also visible further down the road.

All subsequent frames are identical to the first, showing no dynamic changes, newly revealed objects, or alterations to the visible scene elements.

The first frame displays an urban road extending forward, marked with yellow box junction lines and double yellow lines in the foreground. To the left, a sidewalk features a green-trimmed building with storefronts, several small trees, a blue street sign, and a cluster of tall buildings behind them. To the right, a large concrete elevated overpass curves overhead, supported by pillars, while below it, a concrete barrier holds green foliage, and multiple red traffic lights are visible along its structure and at the top right.
end of description
Initially, all traffic lights on the right side remain red. The top right traffic light, along with the two traffic lights beneath the overpass, then sequentially change from red to yellow, and finally to green. Subsequently, a person riding a scooter is revealed entering the road from the left side of the first-frame viewpoint, beginning to move forward.

The first frame depicts a multi-lane urban road curving slightly right, marked with yellow cross-hatchings and double lines in the foreground. To the left, a scooter with two riders is partially visible, while tall buildings, including a glass-fronted one and a blue "Kennedy Town" sign, line the sidewalk with small trees. On the right, a massive concrete elevated highway curves overhead, with a green traffic light and a concrete barrier topped with green foliage running parallel to the road.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the scooter in the foreground progresses ahead and to the left of its initial position. Consequently, previously present elements like the buildings and elevated highway appear to recede towards the rear of the viewer's original position. A new white arrow pointing straight ahead becomes fully visible on the road surface directly in front of the advancing viewpoint.
