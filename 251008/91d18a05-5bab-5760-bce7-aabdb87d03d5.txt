In the first frame, a dark brown railing runs along the bottom left, parallel to the viewer. To the left, a thick dark green pole stands vertically, partially obscuring the river beyond. Docked to the right of the pole and extending towards the center and right is a long boat featuring a dark hull, a light deck, and a tan canopy adorned with red lanterns. A white banner with Japanese writing hangs prominently from the canopy near the center. In the background, a large red arch bridge spans the river to the left of the boat, while further back, a city skyline with buildings, including a golden-topped skyscraper, is visible under a clear blue sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly shifts to the right, revealing more of the boat's stern and the red bridge further into the background. The initial green pole and the railing gradually move towards the left edge of the frame. Consequently, new details on the boat's deck, such as blue crates and other items, become visible further to the right of their initial positions. The city structures behind the boat's stern are also increasingly uncovered, expanding the background view to the right.
