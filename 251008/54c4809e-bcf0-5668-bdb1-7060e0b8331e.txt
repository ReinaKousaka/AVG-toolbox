The first frame presents a cobbled street with buildings on both sides; a light-colored building with a dark door and small window occupies the right foreground, while white buildings with red planters and balconies line the left, receding under an overcast sky.

Subsequently, the viewpoint slowly pans left, gradually revealing more of the street and buildings that were initially further left of the frame. This continuous pan shows less of the right-side building, which moves out of view to the viewer's right, and introduces a white car in the mid-background, previously hidden further down the street to the left.

The first frame depicts a cobblestone street lined with white buildings, most featuring dark grey bases. On the immediate left, a corner building with an awning displays multiple framed signs and boasts an upper balcony adorned with red decorative elements and potted plants. Further down the street on the left, more buildings extend into the distance, with a taller, unpainted building dominating the mid-background. A white car is parked on the right side of the street in the mid-ground, while a wall with blue graffiti occupies the far right foreground, partially obscuring the view.

The camera slowly pans to the right and subtly zooms in, causing the graffiti-covered wall on the far right of the first frame to gradually move out of view to the right. This motion reveals more of the street and buildings on the right side, including a clearly visible green "Farmacia" sign with a cross further down the street on the right, and a lamppost just behind it. The white car, still parked on the right, appears slightly more centered as the perspective shifts.
