The first frame shows the viewer on a street with a multi-story building immediately to the right, featuring arched ground-level storefronts and balconies above, one displaying flags. Two bicycles are parked directly to the viewer's front-right on the sidewalk, with two green dumpsters further down the right sidewalk. To the left, a park-like area with trees (some bare, some evergreen), streetlights, and a low concrete barrier runs parallel to the street, which extends into the distance where several parked cars are visible. The background consists of more buildings under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily advances forward along the street. As the camera moves, the two bicycles parked on the right are the first objects to disappear from view to the viewer's past right. Subsequently, the two green dumpsters on the right become more central before also moving out of frame to the viewer's past right. Concurrently, new sections of the street and the building facades further down the road are continually revealed ahead.

The first frame depicts a wide street extending into the distance, bordered on the left by a park with bare trees, bushes, and lampposts, and on the right by a multi-story building featuring arched ground-floor facades and balconies, with a green trash bin and benches in the immediate foreground right. end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the green bin and initial benches on the right exit the frame (moving behind the viewer). The street, park, and building facades progressively advance towards the viewer, revealing more parked cars along the left sidewalk and a restaurant terrace with patrons under green awnings on the right. The lampposts and trees on the left pass by as the perspective shifts further down the street.

The first frame captures a city street viewed from a moving vehicle. To the viewer's left, a wide park area with bare trees, several ornate streetlights, and distant evergreen trees is visible, with a black car partially parked in the immediate foreground. The center features a gray asphalt road with white lane markings, flanked by a row of parked cars on the left. To the right, a large multi-story building with arched ground-floor entrances and a green awning over an outdoor cafe area, where people are seated, extends into the background. Distant buildings, including one with a prominent tower, are visible against a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the black car, initially partially visible in the first frame's left foreground, slowly moves further left and out of view, revealing more of the white SUV parked behind it. Simultaneously, the prominent streetlight on the left side of the first frame also moves out of view to the left, and new parked cars become visible further down the street on the left. The building facade on the right becomes slightly clearer as the perspective shifts forward.

A city street stretches into the distance, flanked by a row of parked cars on the left and multi-story buildings with arched facades and a cafe on the right. A treelined park area is visible on the far left, while the background features additional buildings under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the black car initially in the foreground on the far left gradually exits the frame to the left. A new black SUV subsequently enters the frame from the far left, becoming the closest parked vehicle. Concurrently, individuals on the right sidewalk are observed moving further away from the viewer, eventually disappearing from view along with the cafe seating.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a city street stretching forward, with a white SUV parked partially in the foreground left, followed by a line of other cars along the left side of the road, bordering a park with trees and streetlights. On the right, multi-story buildings with balconies and arched ground floors line a sidewalk where two people stand near a bench, with more distant buildings, including a prominent reddish one, visible under a partly cloudy sky.

end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's position moves forward along the street. The parked cars on the left and the two people on the right sidewalk shift out of frame to the left of their initial positions, revealing new portions of the street and, on the right, blue recycling bins appear further along from the original viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a city street extends into the distance, flanked by buildings and a park under a partly cloudy sky. To the viewer's left, a white SUV is partially visible in the foreground, followed by a dark car and a line of parked scooters. Beyond these, a pedestrian area features bare trees, ornate street lamps, and distant buildings. To the viewer's right, a multi-story building with balconies and ground-level arches lines the street, with green foliage, recycling bins, a bench, and a red traffic light further down.
end of description
The dark car on the left moves forward, progressively exiting the frame while revealing more of the sidewalk and a person walking towards the background. Simultaneously, the scooter rider in the mid-ground advances down the street. The traffic light on the right changes from red to green as the scooter approaches, continuing its movement past the now green light.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a city street with a row of parked scooters occupying the left foreground and middle ground, while colorful recycling bins (green, yellow, blue) and a multi-story building with arched ground-floor windows are visible along the right sidewalk. A street extends into the distance ahead, featuring a green traffic light overhead and a distant motorcycle, with a park-like area and bare trees to the far left.
end of description
Subsequently, the viewpoint subtly shifts right, causing the parked scooters on the left to move further from the frame's center and revealing more of the sidewalk and building to the right of the recycling bins. Concurrently, the distant motorcycle moves slightly closer, and a pedestrian on the right sidewalk walks gradually towards the viewer.
