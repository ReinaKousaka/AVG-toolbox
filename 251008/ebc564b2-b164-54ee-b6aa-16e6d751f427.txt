In the first frame, the rear of a silver SUV occupies the right foreground, while a person in a dark jacket stands center-left on a snow-covered ground, facing a ski rack and other individuals near snow-covered wooden buildings labeled "ARROWHEAD" on the right. A snow-covered road curves into the left background, flanked by evergreen trees and distant snow-capped mountains under a cloudy sky.

As the frames progress, the person in the dark jacket adjusts their headwear and turns towards the road, while individuals near the building move, with one person at the entrance donning a face mask. Subsequently, a dark blue SUV emerges from the far left background, traveling towards the viewer along the road, eventually occupying the left foreground as the person in the dark jacket fully turns to face it.
