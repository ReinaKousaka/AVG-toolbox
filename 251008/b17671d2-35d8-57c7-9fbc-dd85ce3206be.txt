The first frame shows a wet street at night, likely during heavy rain, with reflections of lights on the asphalt road in the immediate foreground extending to the mid-ground. To the left, a blue overhead road sign and a green traffic light are visible, along with multiple streetlights illuminating the scene. Several vehicles with bright headlights are driving away from the viewer in the mid-ground, while a line of trees and utility poles runs along the right side of the road, bordering a wet sidewalk.

In subsequent frames, a white car in the mid-ground continues to move further away from the viewer. A dark SUV then enters from the immediate left foreground in frame 5, driving across the viewer's field of vision. This SUV proceeds to move further to the right and slightly away from the viewer, revealing its rear and red taillights by frame 7. Concurrently, a person holding an umbrella appears on the sidewalk to the right, also moving away from the viewer alongside the departing SUV.

The first frame depicts a wet city street at night during heavy rain, with a black car moving away from the viewer in the midground on the left and a person holding an umbrella standing on the sidewalk to the right. Streetlights illuminate the scene, reflecting on the wet asphalt and highlighting a crosswalk in the center, while trees line both sides of the road under a dark sky.

The black car continues to recede further away from the viewer in the midground. A white car then emerges from the distance, moving towards the viewer and across the crosswalk from right to left, generating splashes on the road. The person with the umbrella on the sidewalk remains largely stationary to the right.
