The first frame depicts a street lined with brownstone buildings on the left, featuring multiple stoops, one of which has its balustrade partially covered in white protective material. To the right, a sidewalk extends into the distance, with a person in dark clothing walking towards the viewer from the mid-right side, alongside trees and parked cars. end of description. In subsequent frames, the person on the sidewalk continuously walks closer to the viewer, shifting their position from the mid-right towards the center-left of the frame, appearing larger and more prominent relative to their initial first-frame location.

The first frame presents a tree-lined city street, with a row of brownstone buildings featuring steps and iron railings to the left. A woman in dark attire and white shoes walks towards the viewer on the sidewalk in the mid-ground, while parked cars are visible to the right. Further down the street, additional buildings and distant figures can be seen.
end of description
The woman in black continues walking directly towards the viewer, then proceeds to pass into the left foreground. As she moves, more details of the brownstone facades and signs on the left side of the street become increasingly prominent and fully revealed.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a woman in a dark top and backpack walks from the lower-left foreground towards the left edge, with a green construction sign to her right in the mid-ground, next to brownstone buildings lining the left side of the street. On the right, a large tree trunk stands near parked cars, while a sidewalk extends into the background where two people walk away from the viewer.
end of description
Subsequently, the foreground woman moves completely out of the frame to the left, revealing the full construction sign and the first brownstone's steps and railings. Simultaneously, the two individuals on the sidewalk continue their walk further into the distance away from the viewer.

In the first frame, a large tree trunk occupies the far right foreground. To its left, a dark gray Tesla and other cars are parked along the street, bordered by a row of trees with green foliage. A wide sidewalk stretches from the viewer's foreground into the distance, along which a person in a dark jacket is walking away. On the left, a long row of brown brick buildings with prominent staircases and black railings recedes into the background, with several trash cans positioned at the base of the nearest staircase.
end of description
As the frames progress, the person on the sidewalk continues walking further away from the viewer down the street. The silver/white van partially obscured by the tree trunk on the far right gradually becomes more visible, revealing its front wheel and side panel. All other elements, including the buildings, parked cars, and trees, remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a tree-lined city street, with a row of brownstone buildings and their stoops on the left. On the right, parked cars, including a dark grey Tesla and a silver minivan, line the street next to several trees. A pedestrian is visible walking towards the viewer on the sidewalk, with two trash cans in the immediate foreground on the left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the pedestrian on the sidewalk walks continuously closer towards the viewer from the mid-left, eventually reaching the near-foreground. Their movement reveals more details of their clothing as they approach. The silver minivan, initially in the foreground right, becomes slightly more visible as the viewpoint subtly shifts forward with the moving person.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a woman walks on a paved sidewalk, located in the lower-left foreground and moving towards the viewer. To the viewer's left, a row of brownstone buildings with steps and black railings extends into the distance, while to the viewer's right, parked cars line the street, separated by a sidewalk with multiple trees. The background features more buildings and trees under an overcast sky.
end of description
The woman continues to walk towards the viewer, gradually moving past the camera and exiting the frame on the far left. As she progresses, she can be seen adjusting a white object near her mouth, possibly earbuds, while holding a dark handbag. The background elements, including the buildings, parked cars, and trees along the sidewalk, remain largely stationary throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a tree-lined city street with a row of brownstone buildings and their stoops receding on the left, while a paved sidewalk extends forward in the center. Parked cars line the street on the right, with a large tree trunk prominent in the immediate foreground, partially obscuring a dark SUV, and a gray car almost out of frame on the far right.
end of description
As the camera moves forward along the sidewalk, the prominent foreground tree trunk shifts left, and the gray car on the far right moves entirely out of view past the viewer. This forward motion reveals more of the dark SUV, previously partially obscured on the right, and brings a lamppost and additional parked cars and buildings, previously further ahead, into clearer view on the right side of the street.
