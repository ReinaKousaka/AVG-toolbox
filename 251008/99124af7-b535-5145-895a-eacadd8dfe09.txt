A paved cobblestone street extends forward from the viewer, flanked by a light-colored building with a red wooden door (labeled '12') on the immediate left and a tall, textured stone wall with green foliage on the right. Further down the street on the left, more beige buildings with doors and windows are visible, while distant terracotta-roofed buildings with some green-shuttered windows line the street's end, all under a bright blue sky with white clouds.
end of description
The camera slowly moves forward along the street. The first building on the left with door '12' shifts partially out of frame to the left, revealing more of the adjacent building. Simultaneously, the textured stone wall on the right appears closer, progressively revealing new sections of its brickwork, including a subtle arched inlay, as the viewpoint advances towards the distant buildings.

The first frame shows a narrow, stone-paved street flanked by old buildings under a bright blue sky. To the immediate left, a light-colored building has a prominent brown door with ornate handles and a red pot with yellow flowers near the bottom, along with the house number '12'. Further down the left side, other building entrances and what appears to be a leaned object are visible. To the right, a tall, rugged stone wall with sections of reddish brickwork and an arched pattern extends into the distance. At the far end of the street, more multi-story stone buildings with green and brown shutters, and a blue window, are visible under the clear sky.
end of description
Starting from the third frame, a black text box with the white text "Via Pia" appears and remains consistently in the bottom-left corner of the view for all subsequent frames.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a narrow, paved street named "Via Pia," extending away from the viewer into the distance. To the immediate left, a light yellow building presents an open entrance revealing shelves with small items and a doormat, with a wooden ladder leaning against its facade. A tall, textured stone wall runs along the entire right side of the frame, receding into the midground. Beyond the wall and further down the street, several multi-story buildings with brick walls and distinct windows, some with green and blue shutters, are visible under a bright blue sky with white clouds.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward down the street, causing the light yellow building and its entrance on the left to appear closer and wider, revealing more detail of the items on the shelves. Simultaneously, the stone wall on the right also draws nearer, and the distant buildings at the end of the street become slightly larger relative to the initial frame. The shadows on the paved ground subtly shift and extend as the perspective changes with the forward motion.

The first frame depicts a narrow, paved stone street. To the left, a yellow building features a partially visible shop window with a wooden display and a ladder, followed by a closed metal shutter and a green box on the wall. Opposite, a textured stone wall stretches into the distance, with a grey trash bin visible further down the street, leading to distant buildings under a blue sky.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the street, objects on the left, such as the display stand and ladder, recede and exit the frame. Simultaneously, the trash bin, initially in the mid-ground, moves closer and then past the viewer, while the stone wall on the right also recedes, revealing more of the path ahead and bringing the distant buildings into a closer view.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a narrow, sunlit cobbled alleyway looking forward towards ancient buildings with green shutters under a blue sky. To the viewer's left, an old building features a metallic roll-down door and two grey bins, alongside a wooden stand at the very edge; to the right, a tall stone wall extends into the distance.

end of description

As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward along the alley. The wooden stand on the far left quickly moves out of view, and the two grey bins on the left slide towards and then off-screen to the viewer's left, revealing a newly visible circular manhole cover on the ground near the left wall.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a narrow, stone-paved alleyway flanked by old stone and brick buildings under a blue sky. On the left, a prominent grey roller shutter door occupies the foreground, with two grey trash bins positioned further back near an entrance; on the right, a rough stone wall with green foliage is visible. Straight ahead, the alley curves slightly, revealing more ancient buildings, including one with distinctive green shutters on its windows. end of description.
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward through the alley; the roller shutter and trash bins on the left recede from the viewer. Simultaneously, a dark wooden door partially hidden by foliage on the right and the buildings further down the alley with green shutters progressively appear closer and more detailed as the viewer advances.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a narrow, stone-paved alleyway flanked by old stone buildings under a bright sky. Two gray trash bins with red and white striped markings are visible on the lower left, close to the viewer. To the left, a stone wall with a recessed doorway extends into the background, while to the right, a stone wall features a brown wooden gate partially covered in green foliage. At the far end of the alley, a multi-story building with green shutters and a brown door is prominent.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward through the alley. The two trash bins on the left progressively recede out of view, moving towards the lower-left and becoming positioned behind the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the stone walls on both sides, along with the building at the alley's end, gradually grow larger and closer to the viewer. The stone paving and architectural details of the doorways and gates become more defined as the perspective advances deeper into the scene.
