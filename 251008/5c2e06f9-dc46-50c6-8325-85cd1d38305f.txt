The first frame shows a wet city street at dusk, viewed from a forward-facing perspective, with multi-story buildings, including an 'EDGARS' sign on the right, lining both sides under a cloudy sky. A white van with flashing amber hazard lights is centered ahead in the middle lane, accompanied by a white car slightly behind and to its right, a pedestrian on the left sidewalk, and several green traffic lights further down the street.

The viewer's perspective slowly advances along the street. The white car on the right moves forward, eventually positioning itself beside the stationary van, while the pedestrian on the left proceeds deeper into the scene. Additionally, more pedestrians become visible on the right sidewalk, and a red bus partially appears further down the street on the right.

The first frame captures a rainy city street scene at dusk from a vehicle's perspective. Immediately to the viewer's left is a white sedan, partially obscuring the sidewalk. Directly ahead, a white delivery van sits in the road, which is marked with yellow and white lines leading to a pedestrian crossing. Tall buildings line both sides of the street, with pedestrians visible on the sidewalks, notably near a red bus stop structure on the right. Multiple sets of green traffic lights are active on both the left and right sides, and more buildings recede into the distance under an overcast sky.
end of description
The white sedan, initially to the viewer's left, begins to move forward and to the right, crossing the pedestrian zone while its right turn signal flashes. The viewer's vehicle also advances, causing the white sedan to gradually move further away and eventually out of the frame to the right. The white van ahead remains mostly stationary relative to the changing foreground.

The first frame presents a wet city street at dusk, featuring a crosswalk in the foreground, tall buildings lining both sides, and a stationary white van with hazard lights in the midground center. Pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks to the left and right, under green traffic lights positioned above the left sidewalk and further down the street on the right. end of description. Subsequently, multiple pedestrians commence crossing the street; some move from the left sidewalk towards the right, while others, including a person in a white top and light skirt, cross from the right sidewalk to the left, passing in front of the stationary van.
