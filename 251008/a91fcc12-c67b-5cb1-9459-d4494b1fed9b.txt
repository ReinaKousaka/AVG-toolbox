In the first frame, a black metal railing diagonally traverses the mid-foreground, separating a wet sidewalk on the right, where a tree trunk stands and two scooters are parked near a distant pedestrian, from a wet street with yellow and white lines on the left. A blue bus is seen from its rear-right, moving leftward down the rainy street, partially obscured by a tree trunk on the near left, while buildings with illuminated storefronts line the background on the far left.

end of description
The blue bus continues its leftward motion, revealing the "601" route number on its rear as it moves further away from the viewer. It proceeds down the street to the left, gradually diminishing in size and eventually exiting the frame from the far left, leaving the rain-swept street and buildings in view. The pedestrian with the umbrella on the far right continues to walk away from the viewer.
