The first frame captures a rainy city street scene with a wet crosswalk spanning the foreground. A blue truck is partially visible on the extreme right, while a man holding an umbrella crosses the street from the mid-left towards the mid-right. Buildings with signs and trees line both sides of the street, with distant high-rise buildings under an overcast sky.

The man with the umbrella continues his walk across the crosswalk to the right, eventually moving out of view. Simultaneously, the blue truck on the right advances forward, exiting the frame and revealing more of the wet street and the adjacent sidewalk. Pedestrians on the distant sidewalks continue to move, and rain visibly disturbs the reflective puddles on the street.

The first frame displays a wet city street, with a black and white pedestrian crossing prominently in the immediate foreground. Looking down the street, buildings line both sides; on the left, storefronts like KFC are visible with a parked silver car and a person holding a black umbrella on the sidewalk, while on the right, another person with a white umbrella stands near an 'e mart' building.
end of description
Chronologically, the person with the black umbrella begins to cross the street from the left sidewalk towards the right, moving over the pedestrian crossing and into the midground. Simultaneously, the silver car and a white car parked behind it on the left side of the street slowly advance further into the scene.

The first frame displays a wet city street extending into the distance under an overcast sky, with distinct white crosswalk stripes closest to the viewer in the foreground and a manhole cover mid-road. To the viewer's left, a commercial building features illuminated storefronts and a red and green balloon arch, with a silver SUV and a white car parked along the curb, and a person with a black umbrella crossing the street from left to right in the midground. To the right, another building with an orange facade and steps leads up from the sidewalk, while tall residential buildings are visible further down the street in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the person holding the black umbrella moves continuously across the wet street. They walk from the left side of the crosswalk, progressively shifting further towards the right side relative to the first-frame viewpoint. All other elements, including the parked vehicles, buildings, and trees, remain static in their original positions.
