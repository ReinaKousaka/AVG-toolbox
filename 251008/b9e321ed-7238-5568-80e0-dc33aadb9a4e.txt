The first frame displays a street scene with a cobblestone path on the left and tram tracks on the right, leading towards a prominent bell tower and a grand building in the background. A modern building flanks the left side, while a large Gothic church with tall windows borders the right; a cyclist is positioned on the tram tracks in the mid-right, moving leftward relative to the viewer.
end of description
As the frames progress, the cyclist continues moving leftward, passing in front of the viewer and eventually exiting the frame to the left, indicating motion across the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the distant pedestrians on the right-hand sidewalk also subtly move closer towards the viewer's original position.

The first frame displays a street view looking ahead towards a distant, ornate bell tower and a large building beneath it, under a blue sky with white clouds. To the immediate left, a modern building with reflective glass and light panels lines a cobblestone sidewalk. To the right, a large, ancient stone church with tall arched windows extends from foreground to mid-ground, bordered by a green patch and a fence. An asphalt road with tram tracks runs centrally into the distance, where several pedestrians walk along the right side of the street, moving away from the viewer.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the street. The initial pedestrians on the right sidewalk continue receding further into the distance, while new pedestrians appear closer on the right, also moving away from the first-frame viewpoint. A cyclist emerges from the distant center, riding towards and then past the viewer's original position on the left side of the tram tracks. As the scene progresses, the building on the left becomes more prominent, revealing an "ibis" sign that appears higher and further along the facade relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a street scene with tram tracks leading towards a distant bell tower and a grand building, flanked by a commercial building on the left and a large stone church on the right, where two pedestrians walk ahead on the sidewalk; a cyclist also rides away from the viewer along the tracks.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the cyclist rapidly moves further away and completely exits the frame to the viewer's left. The two pedestrians on the right sidewalk continuously move further into the distance, nearing the street's curve. The scene effectively captures forward motion as the foreground appears to advance slightly, clearing the path of the initial moving figures.
