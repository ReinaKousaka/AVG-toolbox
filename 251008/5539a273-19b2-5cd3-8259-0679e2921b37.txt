The first frame displays a commercial building with a dominant glass storefront, seen from a slightly elevated viewpoint across a wet paved surface. Centrally positioned is a glass entrance door, adorned with several promotional posters, including one for "CHICAGO." To the left of the entrance, a large refrigerated display case is visible through the window, alongside a yellow 'wet floor' sign on the wet ground. To the right, through expansive windows, numerous wooden tables and chairs furnish the interior, with a person faintly visible seated at a table towards the far right. The foreground features a two-tiered step structure leading up to the building, while the overall scene suggests evening or night due to interior illumination and external darkness.

In subsequent frames, water dynamically begins to stream from a drainage point on the building's facade, located to the right of the steps and near the base of the rightmost visible vertical column. This water initially emerges subtly in frame 3 and progressively intensifies, forming a distinct flow onto the wet pavement directly below the drainage point. By frames 6-8, the stream reaches its peak, creating a visible splash as it continuously hits the ground in front of the right-hand part of the building. The flow then appears to slightly diminish by the final frame.
