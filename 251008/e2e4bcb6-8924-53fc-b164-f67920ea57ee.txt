The first frame features a multi-story wooden house with a dark brown facade and a light-colored foundation, positioned to the right and center of the viewer. A lush red rose bush with abundant blooms stands in front of the house's lower left corner, while a paved road curves to the viewer's left, receding past other buildings towards a distant lake and mountains. A gravel path or driveway is visible in front of the house to the right of the rose bush.
end of description
Beginning in the fifth frame, a person gradually becomes visible sitting on the steps to the right side of the house, near the edge of the gravel path.
