The first frame shows a narrow concrete path leading into the distance on the right, bordered on the left by a wooden fence running alongside a stream filled with green foliage. Beyond the stream and fence, numerous traditional multi-story wooden buildings with balconies and tiled roofs ascend a lush green hillside towards the background. Two individuals are seated on a bench to the right of the concrete path, with one wearing a colorful striped garment. To the far right, a wooden structure with hanging red lanterns and other items partially frames the scene, while a hill covered in bamboo shoots rises in the upper left background under an overcast sky.

The camera slowly tracks forward and slightly to the right, causing the entire scene to shift perspective, making objects further along the path appear closer and revealing more of the architectural details. The two individuals seated on the bench subtly adjust their posture, while a red car, previously partially obscured behind a purple signpost, becomes more prominent on the right side of the path. The interior and shelved contents of the building on the immediate right are progressively revealed as the viewpoint advances.
