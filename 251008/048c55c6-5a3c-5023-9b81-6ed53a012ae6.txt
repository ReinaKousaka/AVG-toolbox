In the first frame, a paved waterfront promenade stretches from the viewer into the distance under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left, a woman with long, curly brown hair, wearing a red patterned top and black leggings, walks away from the viewer towards the left. Further left, a modern building with a curved roof is partially visible behind greenery. Along the walkway, several pedestrians are scattered, some walking away, others approaching. To the right of the promenade, a railing borders a body of water where a large white boat is visible in the mid-distance. In the far background to the right, a city skyline featuring a prominent tall skyscraper rises against the horizon.
