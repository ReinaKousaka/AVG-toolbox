The first frame shows a paved road curving slightly left, leading away from the viewer. To the immediate left, a steep, rocky cliff face covered with vegetation and protective netting rises upwards. On the right, a low stone wall separates the road from the deep blue sea and a distant green coastline. A white car is visible directly ahead on the road, with a smaller vehicle further in the distance, all under a clear blue sky.

end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the cliff face and netting on the left continue to be revealed, while the white car and the smaller vehicle recede further. A street light pole then appears on the left, followed by two pedestrians walking alongside the road, progressively becoming more visible as the scene advances.
