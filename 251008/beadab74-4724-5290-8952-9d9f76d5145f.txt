In the first frame, two women walk away from the viewer on a brick sidewalk; the one in a beige dress is closer and to the left, while the woman in a white dress is slightly further and to her right. To the far right, a dark trash can with a green lid is visible near the viewer. Beyond them, a crosswalk stretches across a multi-lane street filled with vehicles, including a yellow taxi moving leftward, while a street pole with traffic lights and a green utility box stands on the right side of the crosswalk, partially obscuring a person. Further left, a black SUV is parked beside the sidewalk, which is lined with trees and leads to more pedestrians, with various city buildings and billboards forming the background under a hazy sky.

As the frames progress, the two women in the foreground continue walking away, moving further down the sidewalk and towards the left. The yellow taxi cab in the midground proceeds leftward, slowly exiting the frame, while other vehicles on the street also adjust their positions. The partially obscured person near the utility box on the right moves slightly forward. Simultaneously, a pigeon on the sidewalk near the crosswalk shifts its position, and the black SUV on the far left of the street gradually drives forward.

The first frame captures a city street scene from behind two women walking away from the viewer on a brick sidewalk; the woman closer to the viewer wears a beige dress, and the one ahead wears a white two-piece outfit. To their left, parked cars line the street, while to their right, a pedestrian crosswalk leads to a busy intersection with various vehicles and tall buildings in the background. A small bird rests on the sidewalk in the right foreground.

In subsequent frames, both women continue walking forward, away from the viewer, towards the crosswalk on the right. A black SUV, initially parked to their left, slowly advances from the left street into the intersection and turns right, now positioned across the street relative to the viewer. Other vehicles across the intersection also subtly shift positions as traffic flows, while the pigeon in the foreground remains largely static.
