frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame shows a railway track extending directly away from the viewer, curving gently to the right in the mid-ground, flanked by a gravel ballast bed. To the immediate left, a steep, rocky hillside covered in bare trees rises, while to the right, a rocky embankment runs parallel to the track, featuring a dark, rectangular drainage-like structure. In the background, a large mountain range with a prominent snow-capped peak is visible under a light sky.

There are no dynamic changes or newly revealed objects in the following frames, as the scene remains static with all elements holding their initial spatial positions relative to the viewer.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
A pair of train tracks laid on a gravel bed extends from the bottom center, curving slightly right into the middle distance. To the left, a steep, rocky hillside covered with bare trees and brown vegetation rises from the tracks. To the right, a less steep embankment with rocks and sparse foliage borders the tracks, alongside a dark, rectangular channel running parallel. Overhead line poles stand along both sides, receding into the distance, with the closest on the mid-left. In the far background, hazy mountains, one with a snow-capped peak, are visible under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the immediate rocky and tree-covered terrain on both the left and right, initially ahead, moves past the viewer. The overhead line poles, previously further down the tracks on either side, pass by the viewer's immediate left and right. The winding tracks continuously reveal new sections ahead, and the distant snow-capped mountain remains in the background as the scene progresses.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a railway track extending from the foreground into the mid-distance, curving gently to the right, flanked by a steep, rocky, forested hillside with bare trees on the left and a shorter, rocky bank with sparse vegetation on the right, all beneath distant snow-capped mountains.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, continuously revealing new track ahead while the landscape to the left and right passes and recedes behind the viewer's initial position. The rocky hillsides and bare trees, initially visible to the sides, shift backwards, moving past the viewer. Utility poles, initially in the mid-distance on the right, gradually approach and then pass to the immediate right of the viewer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a view down a set of train tracks, positioned centrally in the foreground and extending into the distance where they gently curve to the left. On either side, steep hills rise, covered with bare trees and rocky, sparse vegetation; the hill on the left is closer and more pronounced. Overhead line poles stand along the right side of the tracks in the mid-ground and distance, while snow-capped mountains are visible in the far background, primarily to the right, beneath an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the foreground terrain continuously passes by, revealing more of the curving railway ahead. The overhead line poles progressively move closer and then disappear behind the viewer on the right. A dark, arch-like opening, likely a tunnel or culvert entrance, gradually emerges on the lower left side of the tracks, which the viewpoint then passes directly over and beyond. Concurrently, a small waterfall or stream becomes visible flowing into this opening on the left, and a wire fence appears higher up the left hillside as the scene continues to unfold.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a train track extending directly forward from the viewer, laid on a gravel ballast bed, curving gently to the right in the mid-distance, flanked by steep, sparsely vegetated mountain slopes. A fence runs along the upper left slope, while distant snow-capped mountains define the horizon within a valley ahead.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the immediate foreground shifts, revealing more of the curving path ahead. Telegraph poles with overhead lines progressively appear and approach from the mid-distance along the right side of the tracks. A yellow cautionary sign also emerges on the right of the tracks, drawing closer to the viewer's right.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays railroad tracks extending centrally from the foreground, curving slightly to the right into the mid-ground, flanked by ballast. Steep, bare hillsides rise on both the left and right, covered with sparse vegetation, while snow-capped mountains appear in the distant background under an overcast sky; overhead, a catenary system runs parallel, with a pole featuring a yellow diamond-shaped sign positioned on the right hillside.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the tracks and ballast continuously pass beneath the viewer, and the hillsides on both sides appear to rush by. The power pole with the yellow sign steadily approaches and then passes to the viewer's right. Further along, a small wooden fence and a structure on the left hillside become newly visible as the train proceeds through the mountainous landscape.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays railway tracks extending forward, curving gently to the right into a mountainous valley, flanked by steep, rocky, and sparsely vegetated hillsides leading to distant snow-capped peaks. A prominent grey utility pole, adorned with a yellow diamond-shaped sign featuring a black 'X', stands to the right of the tracks in the foreground.
end of description
As the view progresses forward along the tracks, the utility pole and sign exit the frame to the right. Simultaneously, a small, dilapidated wooden shed on the left hillside, initially further in the mid-ground, becomes clearer as the viewpoint advances, continuously revealing the shifting barren terrain and distant mountains.
