The first frame displays a forest scene with a dark brown dirt path running along the left side, bordered by a low wooden fence made of posts. To the right of the path, a prominent tree trunk stands in the mid-right foreground, with the forest floor everywhere else blanketed in vibrant blue flowers and green foliage. Ahead on the path, a group of people walks away from the viewer, while numerous tall trees with bright green leaves extend into the background under a light sky.

end of description

The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the path from the initial position. As the viewer progresses, the group of people ahead recedes and eventually moves beyond the left edge of the initial frame, while the prominent tree trunk in the mid-right passes to the viewer's left. New sections of the path, fence, and the bluebell-covered forest floor are continuously revealed in the central and right areas, further ahead into the scene from the first frame's perspective.
