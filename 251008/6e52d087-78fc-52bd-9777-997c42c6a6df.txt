A white building on the left displays a 'bobois PARIS' sign and an illuminated 'CARPETS' sign protruding over the street. The street, reflecting numerous lights, leads towards a distant purple-lit building, flanked by a tall office building on the right under a blue light beam.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly left, revealing more of the front left side of the dark vehicle, now more prominently visible on the extreme left. The reflections on the wet street dynamically change, enhancing the urban night scene, while other visible objects maintain their relative positions within the shifting perspective.

The first frame captures a rainy night street scene with a white building wall occupying the left foreground, displaying a banner with "bobois PARIS" on its upper part and a brightly lit "rochebobois" storefront below. To the right, a dark, tall building with illuminated windows rises, reflecting a diagonal blue light streak in the upper right sky. The wet street in the middle ground features a white SUV parked on the left and another dark car further down on the right, all under the glow of several streetlights.
end of description
As the frames progress, traffic moves down the wet street to the right of the parked white SUV, with vehicles appearing from the far distance and passing towards the viewer's left. A dark object, likely an open umbrella, gradually intrudes into the upper left portion of the view from frame seven, partially obscuring the sky and the top of the left building. Simultaneously, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly right, causing the "bobois PARIS" sign to exit the frame from the top left while revealing more of the "rochebobois" sign and storefront.
