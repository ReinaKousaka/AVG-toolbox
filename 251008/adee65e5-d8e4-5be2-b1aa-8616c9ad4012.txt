The first frame displays a street scene bordered by buildings; a modern building with large reflective windows and a grey awning is to the viewer's left, featuring a parked van and bicycles. To the right, a cream-colored building with red window frames and blue shutters has outdoor seating, a palm plant, and an A-frame sign on the sidewalk. A paved street with a red central stripe extends into the midground, where more traditional buildings and distant people are visible, all backed by large, forested mountains and a yellow construction crane with a Swiss flag to the left.

The first frame captures a paved street extending forward into the distance, lined by buildings on both sides. To the viewer's left is a modern building with large reflective glass windows, in front of which a dark bicycle and a white car are parked further away. On the right, an older building features storefronts with outdoor seating, an A-frame sign, and a dark bicycle parked closer to the viewer. A large, tree-covered mountain rises prominently in the background, with a yellow construction crane visible on its upper left slope.

In the first frame, a paved street with a reddish-brown central stripe extends into the distance, flanked by buildings. To the viewer's immediate left, a light-colored building with large glass doors is visible, with a silver car parked in front of it, partially obscured, and a black bicycle leaning against the car. On the viewer's right, another building houses a "Crazy Beer Shop" with outdoor red chairs and an A-frame sign. Further down the street, more buildings line both sides, with a traditional wooden building featuring green shutters on the left, and a few pedestrians in the midground. Dominating the background is a large, rugged mountain covered in sparse trees, with a yellow construction crane visible above the buildings on the left.

Across the following frames, the silver car parked on the left slowly pulls forward and slightly away from the viewer, with its initially open door closing. The black bicycle parked in front of the car moves along with it. Simultaneously, the camera subtly pans to the right and slightly zooms in, causing the building on the far left to recede slightly from view. The few pedestrians visible in the midground also appear to slowly walk further into the distance along the street.

The first frame depicts a quaint street scene with a silver van and a bicycle parked to the viewer's immediate left, under a building overhang. To the right, a building with prominent red window frames features outdoor seating and signs for a "Takeaway Craft Beer Shop" and "Skydive Jump the Alps!". A paved street with a central red stripe extends into the midground, flanked by a traditional yellow-and-green-shuttered building on the left and another building with red-framed elements on the right. In the background, a vast, forested mountain range rises under a clear sky, with a yellow construction crane visible towards the mountain's left peak.
end of description
A person pushing a dark-colored stroller or cart emerges in the midground-center, initially on the left side of the street, and proceeds to walk further down the street towards the right. Simultaneously, other pedestrians are observed moving on the sidewalk to the left, further into the scene.
