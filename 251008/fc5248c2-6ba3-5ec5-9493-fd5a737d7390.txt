The first frame displays a multi-lane road receding from the viewer, bordered on the left by a fence covered in dense green foliage and on the right by a sidewalk. A silver car occupies the left lane, moving away, with other vehicles visible further ahead. On the right sidewalk, a person walks away from the viewer, next to residential buildings and a partially visible yellow striped sign. A street lamp stands centrally on the right side of the road, with trees scattered across the mid-ground and distant mountains under a partly cloudy sky in the background.
end of description
Throughout the sequence, the silver car on the left moves forward and left, eventually exiting the frame. The pedestrian on the right sidewalk also advances forward and right, disappearing from view as the yellow striped sign on the far right recedes from sight, revealing a pedestrian crossing sign behind it. A black car then appears from behind the initial silver car, continuing forward in the left lane. All stationary objects in the mid-ground and background, like buildings and trees, move closer, indicating the viewer's forward progression.

The first frame presents a road stretching into the distance with white markings; a black SUV is in the left foreground, while a stone wall and lush greenery line the left side. On the right, a sidewalk borders a grassy area featuring a lamppost and a large tree in the middle ground, with buildings and distant mountains visible further away under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the black SUV on the left moves forward, away from the viewer, and eventually exits the frame to the left. The viewpoint advances, causing the lamppost and the large tree on the right to shift towards the viewer's right and then appear behind the initial viewpoint. A multi-panel sign on the right, initially partially obscured by the tree, becomes fully visible, revealing more of the red and white buildings further down the road.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a paved road extending into the distance from the viewer's immediate foreground. To the viewer's right is a grassy verge with a large leafy tree, behind which stands a red building. To the viewer's left, a green hedge borders a sidewalk and a dark fence. Several cars are visible on the road ahead, including a white van in the left lane and other vehicles further down. Distant mountains are visible in the background under a blue sky with clouds.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses forward along the road. The white van, initially in the midground on the left, moves closer to the viewer and towards the lower-left frame. Concurrently, other vehicles further down the road also advance towards the viewer. A dark car emerges into view behind the large tree on the right, previously obscured. The red building and trees on the right recede slightly, revealing more of the road and additional structures further along the right side. Shadows on the road also lengthen and shift with the progression.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a road extending forward with a white van partially visible to the viewer's immediate left, a dense green treeline further along on the left, and a sidewalk, a large tree, and a red building on the right, while several cars including a silver one are ahead, and mountains rise in the distant background.

end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward along the road, causing the initial white van to recede behind the viewpoint and a new grey car to appear on the far left lane, moving towards and then past the viewer. Simultaneously, the tree and the red building on the right, now showing red 'ewo' banners, become closer and more detailed. The white van and other vehicles previously ahead on the road also draw nearer to the viewer's position.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a street scene with an asphalt road occupying the foreground and middle. To the left of the road, lush green trees and bushes line the route, while a white box truck is positioned in the left lane, relatively close to the viewer. On the right, a sidewalk borders a multi-story building with a distinctive red facade and large display windows, from which a red banner hangs vertically, all beneath a bright sky and distant snow-capped mountains.
end of description.
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the road. The white box truck on the left drives past the viewer, moving towards the left side and eventually exiting the frame. Simultaneously, a black car, initially in the midground on the left lane, approaches the first-frame viewpoint, drawing closer to the viewer. Buildings and trees on both sides of the road recede, indicating continuous forward motion through the scene.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a street view with a black car on the far left, a road extending forward with a white van and other vehicles, and a red building featuring a large red 'eWz' banner on the right; trees line the left side, and distant mountains are visible under a clear sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the black car on the left moves out of view, and the white van on the left moves forward relative to the viewer. The red 'eWz' banner on the right is initially replaced by an angled 'WohnKultur' sign, which then gives way to a pole holding several green and brown directional signs. These directional signs fully emerge on the right as the viewpoint advances, with the white van on the left eventually moving mostly out of frame towards the end.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a street scene with a paved road leading forward towards distant mountains under a blue sky. On the right, a multi-story red building with numerous windows occupies the foreground, while a large green tree and other buildings line the left side; a white van and several cars are visible on the road ahead of the viewer.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the street. The white van directly ahead shifts slightly rightward, and a silver car from further back on the left lane approaches, becoming more prominent to the viewer's left. All buildings, trees, and other vehicles gradually recede into the background, continuously revealing more of the street ahead while the distant mountains remain centered in the far background.
