From a street-level viewpoint, the back of a person in a black puffer jacket with a fur-lined hood is in the immediate right foreground, walking away, while a black bin with a green screen is visible on the left. Ahead of them and to their left, a group of three pedestrians also walk away on the sidewalk, which is flanked by a large beige building with grated windows on the right and a city street with blue bikes, a FedEx truck, and tall buildings under string lights on the far left.

end of description

As the frames progress, all initial pedestrians move further away, while new pedestrians emerge from the far right, walking towards the viewer. The viewpoint subtly tracks forward, revealing more of the light-colored building on the right and the street on the left as the individuals recede into the distance.

The first frame captures a sunlit city sidewalk from a first-person perspective, situated behind a person in a dark fur-lined winter coat and baseball cap occupying the right foreground. Ahead, several pedestrians, most notably a person in a black fur-lined coat centrally positioned, walk away from the viewer on the sidewalk. To the right, a light-colored, ornate building with barred windows extends into the background, while to the left, a street features parked blue bicycles, bare trees adorned with string lights, and distant skyscrapers under a bright sky.
end of description
As the frames advance, the viewer moves forward along the sidewalk, causing the group of pedestrians initially ahead to recede further into the distance. The foreground figure closest to the viewer progressively shifts to the right and eventually moves mostly out of frame. Concurrently, new individuals, including a woman with long dark hair and an older man, emerge from behind and to the right of the initial foreground figure, entering the scene and walking past the architectural details of the building on the right, which become more prominent.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows the viewer walking on a city sidewalk behind a person wearing a black parka with a fur-lined hood and a camouflage hat, carrying a patterned bag over their right shoulder. To the viewer's right is a light-colored building facade with windows, and several other people are walking away from the viewer on the same sidewalk. To the viewer's left are bare trees, a metal railing, a street with parked bicycles, and a white truck, all with distant tall buildings under a clear sky in the background.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the people ahead on the sidewalk recede further into the distance. The building on the right becomes more revealed, showing a sign with "GORHAM HALL" above an entrance. A new light-colored receptacle or panel on the building's wall to the right becomes visible as the person in the immediate foreground moves past it. Simultaneously, a person in a light green jacket appears further down the left sidewalk, walking towards the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a first-person perspective walking down a sunny city sidewalk. Immediately in the foreground, to the viewer's right, is the back of a person wearing a black fur-hooded coat and a camouflage cap, carrying a blue-patterned bag. Further along the sidewalk, ahead of the viewer, several people in winter coats are walking away. To the left, a metal railing borders a street with bare trees, parked bicycles, and distant vehicles, backed by towering city buildings. To the right, a large building facade with windows and a bronze-colored box is visible.

end of description

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk, causing the people ahead to appear further away relative to the initial position. More of the street and buildings on the left, previously further in the background, become visible as the viewer advances. The building facade on the right remains to the viewer's right, extending further into the background. A new person in a light jacket appears on the far left of the sidewalk, approaching the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a busy city sidewalk with numerous pedestrians, including the back of a fur-hooded person in the foreground right and a man walking towards the viewer on the left. A bare tree and parked bicycles line the street to the left, while a large building with '1370' is to the right, leading to distant skyscrapers under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the sidewalk. The man initially on the left continues walking towards and then past the viewer, eventually exiting the frame to the immediate left. The pedestrians ahead of the viewer also move further away, revealing more of the street and the architectural details of the building on the right, which remains static relative to the sidewalk.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a sunny city street scene with the back of a person, wearing a dark fur-hooded coat and a camouflage cap, in the immediate foreground to the right. Ahead of the viewer, a group of people, several carrying brown paper bags, walk along a sunlit sidewalk flanked by a small tree with a metal railing on the left and a light-colored building (marked "1370") on the right. Further into the background on the left, a white FedEx truck is parked on the street, followed by a line of blue bicycles, with numerous tall skyscrapers dominating the distant skyline under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer (camera) advances forward along the sidewalk from its initial first-frame position. Consequently, the person in the immediate foreground to the right, and the group of people ahead, all move progressively forward relative to the original first-frame viewpoint. Objects initially situated ahead of the first-frame viewpoint, such as the FedEx truck, the row of blue bicycles to the left, and the building "1370" on the right, are gradually approached by the camera, shifting their positions closer to the initial viewpoint before eventually passing behind it. This continuous forward motion reveals more of the street ahead without introducing new objects from hidden locations within the frame.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a sunny city street from a low, pedestrian-level viewpoint. In the immediate foreground, the back of a person in a dark, fur-hooded coat, holding a patterned bag, walks away from the viewer on a concrete sidewalk. To their left, a line of pedestrians also proceeds away, past a row of blue rental bikes on the far left. Towering skyscrapers dominate the background, with a light-colored building marked '1370' on the right, casting dappled shadows.
end of description
The group of pedestrians in the mid-ground continues walking away from the viewer, moving further down the street. Simultaneously, a woman in a black coat, initially partly obscured in the mid-left, becomes fully visible as she walks towards the viewer, carrying bags. Her path brings her closer to the initial viewpoint, eventually approaching the space directly to the left of where the main foreground person was. The shadows on the sidewalk gradually shift and lengthen throughout the sequence.
