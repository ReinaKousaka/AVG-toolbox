The first frame depicts a pedestrian walkway at dusk, illuminated by vibrant artificial lights. A strong blue light emanates from the center of the path, leading towards a group of approximately four people walking away from the viewer in the midground. To the left, a modern building with many glass windows reflects warm internal lighting, and several trees with red and green foliage stand in raised planters adorned with purple lights. On the right, a white lamppost stands prominently in the foreground, with more trees and planters featuring blue perimeter lighting extending along the path. The sky in the background displays a serene gradient from blue to orange.

As the frames progress, the camera subtly moves forward along the walkway. The foreground lamppost on the right gradually shifts out of view to the right, while the distant group of people in the midground appears slightly closer. The trees and planters on both sides of the path effectively move past the viewer, revealing more of the path ahead relative to the initial viewpoint.

The first frame presents a pedestrian walkway at dusk, illuminated by vibrant purple lights on the path, stretching from the viewer into the distance. In the immediate foreground, a circular planter with glowing blue trim sits to the viewer's bottom right, while another circular tree planter is on the bottom left. Trees with reddish-brown leaves line the path to the viewer's left, behind which a building exhibits purple lighting; similar trees with yellow foliage stand to the viewer's right, backed by a building with warm orange lights. A low railing system, featuring reflective surfaces below, runs along both sides of the path in the midground, with a group of four people walking away from the viewer towards a bright orange horizon under a light blue sky.

As the frames progress, the camera slowly advances forward along the path from the initial viewpoint. The four people continue walking further away from the initial viewpoint into the distance, gradually receding. Trees and railings initially in the midground appear to approach the viewer's position, passing by on both sides as the scene unfolds. New sections of the illuminated path and further distant elements, including additional streetlights and architectural details, continuously become visible ahead of the initial viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a pathway illuminated with purple and white lights at dusk, leading towards an orange-blue horizon. Trees with green leaves line the left side, while trees with yellow foliage stand on the right, framing a group of people walking away into the mid-distance on the path.
end of description
In the following frames, the camera's viewpoint remains largely static. The group of people on the path subtly advances further into the background, moving away from the viewer's initial position. Minor fluctuations in light intensity are visible across the scene, but no new objects or areas are revealed.

The first frame depicts a pedestrian walkway at twilight, with a path illuminated by a vibrant blue light leading away from the viewer towards a group of people walking. To the left, green-leafed trees, a light pole, and a building with purple and green window lights are visible, while to the right, a tree with yellow-orange autumn leaves and a glass railing line the path, with city buildings and a sunset sky in the distance.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the walkway, causing the group of people to appear further ahead. A white structure on the left side, initially partially obscured, becomes more fully revealed, displaying the word "Seoullo" as the camera advances into the scene. The blue light on the path and the purple lights on the lampposts and distant buildings subtly shift and extend, conveying a slow progression through the illuminated urban landscape.
