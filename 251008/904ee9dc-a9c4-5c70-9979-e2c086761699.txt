As the frames progress, the two umbrellas in the foreground move slightly forward, subtly revealing more of the wet pavement and the bustling street ahead. Pedestrians in the mid-ground continue their movement, walking further away from the initial viewpoint, with some individuals becoming more clearly visible as they pass by or are no longer obscured by those closer to the viewer.

As the scene progresses, the camera slowly moves forward. Objects initially in the midground, like the person with the blue umbrella and other pedestrians, gradually move further ahead relative to the first-frame viewpoint, eventually exiting the frame or becoming less prominent. Concurrently, new segments of the street and buildings, previously further in the background, steadily become more prominent and closer to the first-frame viewpoint, revealing more details of their facades.

First, the initial frame displays a rainy night cityscape with a person holding a blue umbrella walking away in the near left foreground, adjacent to a bright yellow illuminated vertical sign with Korean text. To the viewer's immediate right, a dark umbrella is partially visible, while the wet street with yellow pedestrian stripes recedes into the midground, flanked by illuminated storefronts and people with umbrellas, including a 'CAT CAFE' sign on the right side.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera advances forward, causing the blue umbrella and yellow sign to move further left and gradually out of view, revealing more of the street's depth and storefronts. Simultaneously, a prominent light pink cat-shaped sign for the 'CAT CAFE' becomes clearly visible on the right, and additional individuals appear walking further down the illuminated street.

In the first frame, the viewer looks down a wet, bustling city street at night, illuminated by numerous colorful neon signs on buildings lining both sides. In the immediate foreground, a white umbrella partialy obstructs the upper left, while a person in a blue shirt with a black umbrella stands on the left. Several individuals holding various umbrellas walk away from the viewer down the center of the street, their reflections shimmering on the wet pavement. On the left midground, a large blue neon sign of a crouching figure is prominently displayed on a building. To the right, further down, a yellow traffic cone and a pink cat-like statue are visible near a storefront.

The transparent umbrella held above the viewer gradually lowers, expanding its visible area across the top of the frame, refracting and reflecting the vibrant city lights. Simultaneously, all individuals holding umbrellas in the foreground and midground continue walking further away down the wet street. The person in the blue shirt on the left progresses past a white promotional stand, which becomes more fully visible. The group in the center also advances deeper into the scene, with the cat-like statue on the far right appearing slightly further away. The continuous motion emphasizes the bustling atmosphere of the rainy night street as the scene unfolds.

The first frame captures a rainy, neon-lit city street at night, viewed from beneath a transparent umbrella, looking forward. A wet asphalt road, reflecting vibrant lights from storefronts, extends into the distance, occupied by numerous pedestrians holding umbrellas and walking away from the viewer. On the left, a building features a large blue neon sign depicting a squatting figure, while a pole on the right displays illuminated vertical signs, with more shops and people visible further along the street.
end of description
As the frames advance, the viewpoint steadily moves forward down the street, causing the person with the white umbrella on the left to recede further away from their initial position. Simultaneously, the group of people in the mid-ground continues walking deeper into the scene, revealing previously obscured segments of the wet road and distant shop facades. This continuous forward motion brings more of the street environment closer to the viewer relative to the first-frame's perspective.
