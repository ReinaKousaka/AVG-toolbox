The first frame depicts a wet urban street intersection on a cloudy day, with a wide sidewalk on the left foreground, featuring a blue "Visitor Centre" sign and a flag pole further left. Directly across the street, a multi-story modern building stands prominently, flanked on the left by an older stone building with a green boom lift extended, and on the right by traffic lights (showing red), black bollards, and another historic building.
end of description
The green boom lift, located left of the central modern building, subtly retracts from the older building in subsequent frames. From the fourth frame onwards, a small white square cover becomes visible on the foreground sidewalk to the viewer's left. Pedestrians on the right crosswalk and sidewalk exhibit minor position shifts, while a cyclist on the far right street slowly moves towards the center and then away from the viewer.
