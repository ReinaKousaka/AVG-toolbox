The first frame shows a narrow, wet alley at night, illuminated by a distant streetlamp in the background. To the immediate left, a light grey wall with white pipes and a partial brown-framed window leads to a traditional building facade with an ornate metal gate and greenery. On the right, a patterned white wall flanks the reflective paved street receding into the dark background.

The viewpoint slowly moves forward along the alley. This dynamic change causes the initial left-side window to disappear, revealing a Christmas tree decoration on the gate and a prominent address plaque (40-59) as they shift out of frame to the left. The forward motion also progressively reveals more of the patterned wall on the right and brings the distant streetlamp slightly closer.

The first frame shows a wet, tiled pathway receding into the distance, bordered by a dark metal gate and a building facade with white columns and a poster-like image of chairs on the left. To the right, a traditional Korean wall with a patterned design and a dark, curved roof extends along the path. A streetlamp illuminates the scene from the mid-ground, casting reflections on the wet surface, with dark trees visible against the night sky in the background.

The subsequent frames reveal no changes until the eighth frame, where distinct curved streaks of water or rain become visible across the upper and central foreground, appearing closer to the viewer than all other elements in the scene. By the ninth frame, these watery streaks intensify, further obscuring parts of the path and walls as if rain is heavily impacting the camera lens.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a wet, narrow alleyway seen through a rain-splashed translucent surface in the immediate foreground, distorting the view. A light-colored paneled wall extends along the left, while a patterned white wall with a dark tiled roof stretches down the right side. A streetlamp in the upper midground illuminates the cobblestone path that recedes and slightly curves left into a darker background.
end of description
Beginning in the third frame, a person holding an open umbrella becomes visible emerging from the distant, darker section of the alley, positioned straight ahead beyond the streetlamp. This individual, initially small, walks steadily towards the viewer along the wet path. As the frames progress, the person appears progressively larger and closer to the viewer, remaining centered in the alley.
