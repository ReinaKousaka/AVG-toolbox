The first frame depicts a narrow village road curving into the distance, bordered by stone buildings and lush greenery. To the immediate right, a stone building adorned with a white horse emblem is partially obscured by the front of a silver convertible car. On the left, an ivy-clad stone building stands beside a street light pole and a low stone wall, with dense trees visible further along the road.

As the frames progress, the silver car in the foreground on the right side of the road slowly moves away from the viewer and completely out of the frame to the right, fully revealing the lower section of the stone building with the white horse emblem, including its front entrance and the small garden area in front of it.

The first frame presents a narrow, paved country road curving into the distance under a clear sky. To the viewer's right, a tall, stone-faced building with a prominent white horse silhouette on its upper facade and a smaller stone porch near its base dominates the foreground. To the left, a low stone wall overgrown with grass and foliage runs alongside the road, leading to traditional stone cottages and dense green trees further back.

Subsequently, the white horse silhouette on the right-hand building gradually disappears from its facade. Simultaneously, a few small dark birds emerge high in the sky, positioned distantly above the curving road.

A paved road stretches into the distance, curving slightly to the right, flanked by a grassy verge with overgrown stone walls on the left and a narrow sidewalk on the right. Several traditional stone cottages, some covered in foliage, line the left side, while a large multi-story stone building with a prominent window occupies the immediate right foreground. Two small bird-like specks are visible high in the pale sky above a distant, hazy landscape.

The viewpoint slowly moves forward along the road. As the viewer progresses, more of the stone building on the right is revealed, showing additional windows with light blue frames and a distinct doorway further back. The cottages on the left also appear slightly larger and closer, indicating a steady advancement through the village scene.
