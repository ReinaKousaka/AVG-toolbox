The first frame presents a sunny alpine meadow under a clear blue sky, bordered by a dense evergreen forest across the upper and right background. A green sloping meadow fills the mid-ground, where numerous grazing animals and two rustic wooden cabins reside—a prominent one on the right and a smaller one in the distant left—with closer trees framing the foreground and a rocky outcrop visible in the lower left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera subtly pans or moves to the right, progressively revealing more of the landscape located to the right of the initial viewpoint. This motion brings more of the right side of the prominent wooden cabin into view and exposes a previously hidden dirt path winding upwards behind it, originating from just beyond the first frame's right edge. Concurrently, elements on the far left of the original scene, such as the distant cabin, gradually shift further towards the left edge of the frame, accentuating the rightward expansion of the visible scene.
