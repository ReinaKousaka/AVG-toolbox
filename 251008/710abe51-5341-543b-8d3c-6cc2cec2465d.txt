In the first frame, a nighttime city street scene unfolds. To the viewer's immediate right foreground are the backs of two pedestrians, one in a blue jacket. To the left foreground, an illuminated digital billboard stands behind yellow temporary barriers, with two public bins placed next to it. In the midground, a street intersection features a red traffic light, with a white car and a dark car stopped, while several bollards line the road and a pedestrian crossing is visible. Buildings with brightly lit shops line the right and left sides of the street, extending into the background, where additional city lights glow.
end of description
The traffic light in the midground right changes from red to green, allowing the dark car previously stopped at the intersection to begin moving forward. Simultaneously, blue flashing lights from an emergency vehicle, identified as a police car, become increasingly visible behind the dark car and to the right of the intersection. The police car proceeds through the intersection, followed by the white car which also begins to move, as the first-frame pedestrians remain largely in place.
