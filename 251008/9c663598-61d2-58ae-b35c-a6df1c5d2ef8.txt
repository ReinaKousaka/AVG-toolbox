On an elevated wooden walkway, two people, a woman in a white shirt and dark pants, and a man in a blue shirt and brown pants, walk towards the viewer on the left side. Lush green foliage frames both sides of the walkway, with denser trees on the left and a building visible behind trees on the right, further in the background. A light blue sky is visible above the distant buildings.
end of description
The woman and man steadily walk closer to the viewer along the walkway, becoming larger in the frame. Other figures in the distance also approach the viewer, moving into clearer view from beneath a covered structure. The surrounding trees and distant buildings remain in largely fixed positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

In the first frame, a woman in a white shirt and sunglasses is positioned in the near foreground to the left of the viewer, walking forward on a grey walkway with metal railings. Beside her, slightly behind and to her right, a man in a blue striped shirt and brown pants walks in the foreground. Lush green foliage lines both sides of the walkway, which extends towards the midground where other pedestrians are visible. A light-colored multi-story building with windows and balconies stands to the right, behind the foliage, under a bright sky.
end of description
As frames progress, the woman and the man in the blue shirt move towards and then past the first-frame viewpoint, gradually exiting the frame to the left. Concurrently, a third man, initially visible further down the walkway in the midground, continues walking away from the first-frame viewpoint into the background, becoming more prominent as the foreground figures depart. The surrounding building, railings, and green foliage largely maintain their spatial positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame displays an elevated wooden walkway extending into the distance, bordered by metal railings on both sides. Lush green foliage partially obscures the left foreground, while a man in dark clothing walks towards the viewer on the left side of the path. To the left, several people are seated on benches beyond the railing, and to the right, a tall, light-colored building runs parallel to the walkway, which leads into a shaded, tunnel-like structure in the background.
end of description
The man in the foreground continues walking past the viewer towards the left, eventually exiting the frame. Concurrently, the viewpoint slowly advances along the walkway, causing the dense foliage on the left to recede and reveal more of the people seated on the benches and the upper floors of the building to the right, all relative to the original viewpoint.
