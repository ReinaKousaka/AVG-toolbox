The first frame shows a river flowing from the left-center towards the foreground, with a weir partially visible in the bottom right. The left bank is steep, covered in dense green foliage and trees, with visible stone walls and a set of steps in the far left foreground. The right bank features a large, multi-story stone building (likely a mill) with numerous windows, situated prominently in the mid-right. Below this building, along the river, is a stone retaining wall with rocky outcrops and another smaller arched structure with descending steps to the water. In the background, dense green trees line the river, receding under a light sky.

In the subsequent frames, the viewpoint gradually pulls back and shifts slightly to the right, revealing more of the scene. This motion primarily exposes a taller, more elongated stone building situated further to the right and slightly behind the prominent mill building from the initial frame, which appears to have numerous boarded-up or empty window openings. The overall scene expands, increasing the visible expanse of the river and both banks, without any significant movement of objects within the scene itself.

The first frame displays a river flowing from the foreground towards the left mid-ground, flanked by a dense tree-covered bank on the left and a series of historic stone mill buildings on the right. In the center, a prominent multi-story stone building with many windows stands, connected to a smaller structure nestled into a rocky outcrop above the river. To its right, a longer, older building with numerous windows and green shutters is partially visible behind a stone wall with an arched opening and steps, while a dark structure, possibly a weir, is at the bottom-center.

Over the subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly shifts upwards and to the right, gradually revealing more of the scene. A green metal fire escape structure emerges on the far right side of the large, older building, becoming increasingly prominent and fully visible by the final frame. The slight upward shift also reveals a little more of the overcast sky and the upper parts of the buildings and trees.

The first frame shows an old stone mill complex on the right bank of a dark river that flows from the mid-left towards the viewer's bottom right, over a small weir. A large multi-story mill building, with many windows, stands centrally, flanked by a smaller building to the left and a longer, weathered structure with a green fire escape to the far right. Below the main mill, a lower stone structure with an arched opening and some greenery forms part of the riverbank. Dense green trees cover the hills on the far left and behind the buildings, with a steep, dark embankment rising on the far right under an overcast sky.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, the viewpoint gradually pulls back and slightly to the right, causing the entire scene to subtly recede and expand. This movement reveals more of the surrounding environment, particularly uncovering additional length of the steep embankment to the far right and a small bridge leading to it, which was barely visible from the initial perspective. The mill complex and trees become proportionally smaller within the frame, broadening the overall vista.
