In the first frame, the viewer is on a city street, looking forward. Directly in front is a black SUV, with a gray SUV further ahead and slightly to its right. To the left, a modern building with many windows lines a sidewalk with trees and a green bike lane. To the right, an older reddish-brown brick building features a "THRIVE" banner, a bike rental station, people on the sidewalk, and parked cars including a black SUV. The street continues into the distance, with more buildings visible under an overcast sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward. The black SUV previously directly in front moves further ahead and slightly to the left, while the gray SUV also moves ahead and slightly to the right. Buildings and street elements on the left, like the modern building and trees, progressively move from the midground towards the foreground and then pass to the left of the viewer, revealing more of the street ahead. Similarly, the red brick building and the bike rental station on the right approach and pass the viewer, with new sections of the sidewalk and parked vehicles, including a dark gray minivan, becoming visible and then receding as the viewer progresses.

The first frame displays a city street viewed from a low angle on an overcast day. Directly ahead, a black SUV follows a white van in the middle lane. To the immediate right, the rear of a dark gray SUV is partially visible in the foreground. Further right, a row of blue rental bicycles lines a sidewalk in front of a multi-story red brick building with arched windows and columns. On the left, a green bike lane and sidewalk with several small trees run alongside a modern building featuring large glass windows and balconies. In the background, more buildings and vehicles recede down the street.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily advances forward down the street. The dark gray SUV, initially partially visible to the viewer's immediate right, gradually moves further right and out of frame, effectively passing behind the first-frame viewpoint. The black SUV and white van, previously directly ahead, continue their progression further down the road relative to the original viewpoint. Consequently, the buildings, trees, and bicycle rack on both sides of the street scroll from the midground towards and then past the first-frame viewpoint, revealing new segments of the urban landscape ahead.

The first frame shows a city street from a forward-moving perspective, with a white cargo van ahead and to the left, and a black SUV further in the center lane. To the left, a green bike lane runs alongside a sidewalk with trees and modern buildings, while a red brick building with rental bikes lines the right side. Distant buildings and an overcast sky complete the scene. end of description. As the viewpoint advances down the street, the white van moves progressively closer and then past the viewer on the left. Concurrently, the street's left and right sides, including buildings and parked bikes, recede backward, progressively revealing more of the street ahead.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a wide city street stretching into the distance under a cloudy sky. In the immediate foreground, the street features white painted arrows indicating forward and right-turn lanes, along with "ONLY" text in the left lane, and a green bike lane to the far left. To the far right, a row of blue rental bicycles is parked at a dock next to the sidewalk. A black SUV occupies the middle lane directly in front of the viewer, followed by other vehicles further down the street, while pedestrians populate the sidewalks on both sides. On the left, a large billboard with an advertisement depicting two people is prominent, and on the right, a reddish-brown brick building with an "NYU" banner hangs near its facade.

end of description

As the viewpoint progresses forward, the black SUV and other vehicles in front of the viewer recede further into the distance along the street. Simultaneously, the painted street markings, including the 'ONLY' text and arrows, appear to move closer to and then pass beneath the viewer. The row of blue bicycles on the right and the buildings flanking both sides of the street also become slightly larger and more detailed, indicating the viewer's forward movement down the road relative to the initial scene.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a wide view of a city street and intersection, with the viewer facing forward on a multi-lane road featuring white directional arrows and a crosswalk ahead. Tall buildings with large billboards, including one prominently featuring two individuals on the left, flank both sides of the street, while pedestrians populate the sidewalks and a few vehicles, notably a dark SUV centrally positioned, occupy the road.
end of description.
Across subsequent frames, the dark SUV and other cars on the road move forward towards the intersection, while pedestrians continue their movement along the sidewalks and across the crosswalk. Notably, the traffic light ahead transitions from showing red/yellow to green, signaling for the viewer's traffic to proceed forward.
