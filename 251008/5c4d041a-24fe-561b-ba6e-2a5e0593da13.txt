The initial frame presents a night view of a building facade covered in vertical string lights, with a black lamppost featuring a glowing lantern prominently in the right foreground. Two people are visible walking in the lower-left, while brightly lit ground-floor windows display decorative items and a white sign with a green teacup logo above them.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the camera slowly pans upwards and slightly right, revealing more of the building's upper facade and its extensive lighting. The lamppost gradually shifts towards the frame's center-right, and the walking individuals exit the scene to the lower-left, providing a progressively elevated perspective of the illuminated structure.
