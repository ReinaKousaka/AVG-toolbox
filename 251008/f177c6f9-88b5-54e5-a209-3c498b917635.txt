In the first frame, a large dark grey pole adorned with white floral patterns occupies the immediate foreground on the right, partially obscuring the street beyond. To its left, a wet asphalt road features a white pedestrian crossing in the center-right and yellow road markings, with a black SUV driving across the intersection from right to left. On the left, a wet sidewalk with green grass borders the road, featuring a street lamp post and traffic lights, while buildings and shops line the distant street and a line of trees separates the road from more buildings in the background. It is actively raining with visible raindrops.

Subsequently, a dark, boxy vehicle emerges from behind the prominent pole, moving from the viewer's right towards the left across the intersection, appearing behind the initial black SUV. Both vehicles continue their movement to the left, with the black SUV eventually exiting the main field of view. The boxy vehicle proceeds further left across the pedestrian crossing, while a light-colored car becomes more visible in the distance on the far left, heading towards the intersection. Throughout these changes, the rainfall persists, impacting the wet environment.
