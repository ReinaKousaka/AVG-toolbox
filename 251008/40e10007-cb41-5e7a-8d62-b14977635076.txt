The first frame shows a multi-lane road viewed from a vehicle, with a white SUV directly ahead in the center lane. To the viewer's left, a line of white cars is visible next to a white barrier, with tall buildings further in the background and a blue circular sign indicating a downward-left arrow. To the right, a black motorcycle with a rider is positioned behind a white and yellow barrier alongside a green construction fence, behind which two construction cranes and a Ferris wheel are seen, with more buildings in the far right background. A street light pole is also visible on the right. An overlay map is in the upper left corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward: the white SUV initially in front recedes slightly. The blue circular sign on the left moves progressively downwards and exits the frame. The white barrier on the left moves past, revealing new cars, including a black SUV, entering the foreground on the left. The motorcycle on the right also moves forward and eventually exits the frame to the right, while the street lamp post shifts rightward out of view.

The first frame displays a street scene from a vehicle's perspective, with a clear blue sky and a sunburst in the upper-left corner, where a circular map overlay is also present. The road stretches forward, bordered by metal barriers with yellow accents on both sides. To the viewer's left, behind the barrier, are several cars in an adjacent lane, with a white sedan closest. Directly ahead, a white SUV occupies the viewer's lane, moving away. To the right, behind a barrier, a motorcycle rider is visible, while a long green construction fence runs further along. Behind this fence, two prominent cranes and a partially visible Ferris wheel stand, with various multi-story buildings and an ornate commercial complex lining the left side of the street in the background.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the road. The white SUV directly ahead gradually recedes further, and the cars in the left lane advance, with a red car and then a white Mercedes-Benz becoming more prominent. Simultaneously, the large green construction crane on the right side activates, displaying sequential flashing lights along its boom. The motorcycle rider on the far right also moves forward relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows the viewer on a road behind a white SUV, with multiple parked cars to the left behind a white barrier and several multi-story buildings further left. To the right, a green construction barrier runs parallel to the road, featuring a large red and white crane prominently, while a smaller crane and a ferris wheel are visible further down. A navigation map overlay is present in the upper left corner against a bright blue sky with the sun.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the parked cars on the left (including a white minivan and a grey sedan) are passed, revealing a new black sedan in the foreground on the left. Concurrently, the green construction barrier and the large red and white crane on the right recede, while a street light pole and two people on a scooter initially behind the barrier on the right approach and pass the viewer. The white SUV directly ahead maintains its relative position as elements in the midground become foreground objects and background elements recede.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a multi-lane road with a white SUV directly ahead, bordered by white barriers. To the viewer's left, a large building complex is visible, and to the right, a green construction hoarding with a prominent red crane behind it. A map overlay is in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's vehicle slowly moves forward. Cars to the left, like a red sedan, gradually advance relative to the viewer's initial foreground position. The moped on the right also slowly moves ahead, revealing more of the green construction hoarding, while the background elements appear slightly closer.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows the viewer driving on a multi-lane road with a white SUV directly ahead. To the left, several cars are visible in a parallel lane, separated by a white metal barrier and double yellow lines, beyond which stand numerous tall buildings. To the right, another white metal barrier borders green construction hoardings, behind which a large red and white crane and a distinctive dome-topped structure are visible, along with a pedestrian and cyclist near the barrier. A map overlay is present in the top-left corner against a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's vehicle moves forward, causing the white SUV directly ahead and other cars in the left lane to appear further into the distance. A new dark sedan emerges into view from the bottom-left of the frame, occupying the lane parallel to the viewer. Concurrently, the tall buildings on the left and the construction site with the crane on the right appear to recede, moving further back relative to the first-frame viewpoint as the perspective shifts slightly.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a multi-lane road from a driver's perspective under a clear blue sky, with a circular navigation map overlay in the upper left. A white guardrail lines the immediate left, behind which a white Smart car is partially visible, while a white SUV is positioned directly ahead in the viewer's lane. To the far right, a construction site is evident with green barriers and a prominent red crane, while tall buildings extend along the far left beyond an adjacent lane of cars. end of description.
Through subsequent frames, the white SUV directly ahead remains nearly stationary. However, cars in the adjacent left lane progress forward relative to the first-frame viewpoint: the white Smart car moves out of sight, revealing a red car which then moves ahead, followed by a black sedan appearing closer from the left foreground.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a multi-lane road with a forward arrow, bordered by white barriers. To the left, a dark sedan is visible alongside tall city buildings, while to the right, a white SUV is ahead of green construction hoarding and a towering red and green crane. Distant structures, including a central spire, appear under a clear sky, with a circular navigation map overlaid in the top-left corner.
end of description
As frames progress, the viewpoint advances along the road; the white SUV ahead on the right and the dark sedan to the left move further forward, revealing their license plates and, in the left lane, a white SUV emerging from behind the initial sedan.
