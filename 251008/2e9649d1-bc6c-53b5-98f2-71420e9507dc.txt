The first frame presents a vibrant autumn street scene blanketed in yellow ginkgo leaves. To the viewer's left, a large tree trunk with a white-painted base stands prominently, partially obscuring a person crouched down, while further left, another individual photographs a decorative brick wall. A sidewalk covered in yellow leaves extends into the distance, populated by numerous pedestrians, some actively taking photos, alongside a line of tall ginkgo trees with bright yellow foliage. To the right, a road also strewn with yellow leaves hosts moving vehicles and more pedestrians, all beneath a canopy of brilliant yellow leaves stretching into the background.

In subsequent frames, the person initially crouched behind the leftmost tree stands up, revealing a brown jacket and black hat, then turns towards the viewer. Concurrently, an electric scooter with a transparent canopy moves from the mid-right further into the foreground on the street. A person in a brown jacket emerges from behind the second tree on the left, walking away from the viewer. Throughout the sequence, other pedestrians and vehicles continue to subtly shift positions along the sidewalk and street.

The first frame features a street covered in bright yellow ginkgo leaves, with similarly colored trees lining a path extending into the distance on the right. A woman in a black hat and orange jacket is visible on the far left, looking down at an object in her hands, while a brick wall runs horizontally along the mid-left. A couple stands near this wall, and several pedestrians walk away from the viewer on the path; a scooter with a clear plastic cover is partially visible in the foreground right, also facing away, with parked cars and buildings in the background.

As the frames progress, the pedestrians on the path continue moving further away from the viewer. The scooter in the foreground right also moves forward, gradually revealing its driver, a woman in a purple padded coat, who becomes clearly visible by the fifth frame as she drives further along the path relative to the initial viewpoint.
