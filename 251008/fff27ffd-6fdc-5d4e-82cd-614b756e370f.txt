A paved road curves right, receding from the viewer, marked by a solid white line. To the left, a concrete barrier borders a dense, green forested mountain slope, while a sheer, rocky cliff face rises immediately to the right of the road. Distant mountains are visible under a bright, partly cloudy sky ahead.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the rocky cliff on the right and the forested slope/barrier on the left recede, revealing more of the path ahead. The distant mountains and sky ahead appear to draw slightly closer as the curve of the road continues to unfold.
