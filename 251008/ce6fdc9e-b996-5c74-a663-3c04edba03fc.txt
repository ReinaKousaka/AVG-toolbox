The first frame shows a narrow asphalt road curving to the right, extending from the bottom center into the distance. To the immediate left, a large, rugged rock face rises steeply, while to the right, a metal guardrail runs alongside the road, backed by rocky terrain and sparse green vegetation. In the background, a massive, craggy mountain dominates the upper right, beneath a blue sky.
end of description
The viewpoint advances along the road, causing the steep rock face on the immediate left to recede from view. As the camera moves forward, more of the winding road becomes visible, revealing new sections of rocky terrain and sparse vegetation on both sides. The guardrail on the right extends and then ends as the curve progresses, while a distant yellow sign on the right approaches and passes the viewer. The massive background mountain remains static, but the mid-ground elements continuously shift as the viewer traverses the mountain pass.
