In the first frame, a bright blue sky with a strong sunflare at the upper right dominates the top of the scene. To the left, a large, leafy green tree extends from the mid-left towards the top, partially obscuring a stone wall covered in ivy and a path where several people are walking further away in the mid-ground. To the right, a white building with brown window shutters and a dark base stands prominently. In the immediate foreground, slightly right of center, an older man and woman are walking towards the viewer, holding hands, with the woman wearing a pink skirt and carrying a bag. Distant mountains are visible in the far background.
end of description
The camera steadily moves forward, revealing more of the path that was originally further ahead of the viewer. Concurrently, the two main figures in the foreground walk towards the initial viewpoint, growing larger and eventually appearing to pass the original camera position, now occupying the lower central part of the frame. Other pedestrians, previously further ahead along the path, also continue their movement. The large tree on the left and the building on the right, which were initially to the left and right of the first-frame viewpoint, shift their perspective as the camera passes their original relative positions. The sun's flare in the upper right of the frame slightly changes its exact position as the viewpoint advances.
