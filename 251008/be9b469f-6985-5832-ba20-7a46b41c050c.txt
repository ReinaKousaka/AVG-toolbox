In the first frame, a city sidewalk stretches ahead, flanked by a brick building with illuminated windows on the left and a street on the right. A red fire hydrant occupies the foreground-right, while a multi-lamp street light stands in the midground-center-right. Further down the street, a queue of cars with red taillights is visible, bordered by construction barriers on the far right.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the fire hydrant and construction barriers on the right pass the viewer and exit the frame. Simultaneously, the large windows of the brick building on the left and its illuminated interior become more prominent and closer, while the multi-lamp street light passes the viewer from mid-right to mid-left. The person walking ahead on the sidewalk gradually moves further into the distance on the left.
