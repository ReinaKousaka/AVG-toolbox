The first frame displays a wide, paved uphill path, bordered by brown wooden fences on both sides, under a clear blue sky partially obscured by tree canopies. On the left, vibrant yellow-leafed autumn trees frame a green informational sign and a red notice board, while on the right, dense green foliage lines the path. Several pedestrians populate the path, with a group of four in the mid-ground slightly left of center walking towards the viewer, and others visible further uphill.
end of description
As the frames progress, the group of four pedestrians, initially in the mid-ground, walks closer to the viewer, passing by the original first-frame viewpoint and eventually moving towards the bottom-left. Concurrently, a person with a black backpack and another person behind them, both initially on the right side of the mid-ground, also advance forward, coming closer to the viewer and shifting further right. The surrounding natural scenery, including the trees and fences, remains static relative to the initial viewpoint throughout.

The first frame depicts a paved pathway extending into the distance, lined by wooden fences and trees exhibiting both green and autumn yellow foliage, forming an overhead canopy. Several pedestrians are on the path, with a group of three women and a man in a black jacket prominently in the foreground, approaching the viewer. Distant people and a bright structure are visible further down the path, along with green informational signs on both sides.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the path. The foreground pedestrians, including the group of women and the man, gradually move past and out of the frame to the viewer's left and right, revealing new individuals previously further down the path. The distant pathway and structures become progressively closer and more detailed, with more people becoming visible in the mid-ground.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a wide, paved park path with yellow dividing lines, extending into the distance under an open sky framed by trees showing autumn foliage. Wooden fences line both sides of the path, and numerous pedestrians are walking away from the viewer; a green no-smoking sign is on the far left, and a partially obscured green sign is positioned on the bottom right.
end of description
As the frames advance, the viewpoint moves forward along the path, revealing more of the scene ahead. The sign on the bottom right becomes fully visible, displaying a caution graphic of a falling person and Korean text to the viewer's right. People on the path continue moving forward, and some new individuals appear further along the path in front of the original view.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a paved path with two yellow lines down its center, stretching into the distance under a blue sky. Trees with green, yellow, and bare branches form a canopy overhead and line both sides of the path. To the viewer's immediate left, a group of people walk alongside a wooden fence and a stone wall. To the viewer's right, a person with a black backpack walks away from the viewer, parallel to another wooden fence. More pedestrians are visible further down the path, receding into the background.

end of description

The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the path. The group of people initially to the viewer's immediate left walks past and moves out of the frame towards the left, while the person on the right continues walking further away. As the viewer advances, a blue building, previously mostly obscured, progressively becomes more visible far to the left, beyond the initial stone wall and trees.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a wide paved path with yellow center lines receding into the distance, bordered by wooden fences on both sides and autumn-foliaged trees under a clear blue sky. Directly in front, a person in a grey jacket moves right on the left side, and a person in a black jacket walks away on the right, while other pedestrians populate the mid-ground.
end of description
Across the subsequent frames, the stationary viewpoint reveals the continuous movement of multiple pedestrians along the path. The person in the grey jacket exits the frame to the right, as the person in the black jacket walks further away from the viewer. Meanwhile, other individuals, like a person in a black top and light jeans, progress closer from the mid-ground towards the camera's initial position.
