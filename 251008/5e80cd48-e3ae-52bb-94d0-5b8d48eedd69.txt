The first frame captures a wide-angle urban landscape under a clear blue sky, featuring several buildings on the left appearing to lean due to the lens, including a tall brown high-rise centrally, and a white multi-story building on the far left. A paved walkway with hexagonal patterns and a lamppost extends from the foreground to the mid-ground on the right, bordered by a landscaped area with dry vegetation and a white retaining wall on its left. A body of water, backed by distant buildings, is visible beyond a black fence on the far right.
end of description
As the viewpoint subtly moves forward along the paved walkway, objects previously in the mid-ground shift closer to the viewer. A person in red, initially seen near the central brown building, moves left and gradually out of sight behind the retaining wall to the viewer's left. Concurrently, more individuals emerge on the walkway, walking both towards and away from the viewer from the far end, and newly revealed benches become visible further along the walkway on the right. The initial lamppost on the right progresses past the viewer, eventually exiting the frame to the right, as a person on a bicycle appears on the far right approaching the viewer.

The first frame displays an urban waterfront scene under a vivid blue sky, dominated by several tall buildings on the left, including a prominent brown skyscraper and other apartment complexes above a terraced, vegetated slope. To the right, a patterned paved walkway stretches into the distance, bordered by a black fence and a wide river with distant buildings on its far bank, with a streetlamp and a few figures visible along the path.
end of description
In the following frames, a person wearing a dark jacket and light pants approaches and then sits on a green bench located to the right of the walkway, near the streetlamp. Other distant figures continue to slowly move further down the path along the riverside.

The first frame depicts a bright, wide-angle urban waterside scene under a clear blue sky. On the left, multiple tall residential buildings, including a prominent brown skyscraper appearing tilted, dominate the background. Below these buildings, terraced concrete steps and planters with sparse brown foliage lead to a paved walkway extending from the foreground into the distance on the right. A black lamppost leans slightly on the right, with a dark railing bordering a wide, blue-green river beyond which distant buildings line the horizon. A person is seated on a bench on the right-mid-distance, facing right, while another individual in a red jacket is visible on the walkway to the left of the lamppost.
end of description
The person in the red jacket, initially in the mid-distance to the left, progressively walks forward along the path towards the right, moving further into the distance. This individual passes behind the prominent lamppost on the right, then reappears and continues moving away along the waterside path. Concurrently, the person seated on the bench on the right subtly shifts their posture, turning to face more directly towards the distant river. Other indistinct figures in the mid-ground also exhibit slight movements along the path and near the steps on the far left.

The first frame captures a bright urban waterside scene featuring a clear blue sky, towering buildings to the left above concrete steps, and a patterned walkway extending right alongside a river with distant buildings on its far bank. A person in a red coat is visible on the lower steps, while a small group of people occupies the mid-ground section of the walkway.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the individual in the red coat and a newly visible companion in a dark coat ascend the concrete steps on the left, moving further away from the viewer. Concurrently, the group of people on the patterned walkway progresses further into the distance along the pathway to the right.

The scene features a wide-angle view of an urban riverside area under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, to the bottom-left, a set of light-colored steps with black handrails descends, where three figures are situated, two seated and one standing. To the immediate right, a patterned paved walkway extends into the mid-ground, where a group of people walks away from the viewer. A tall black lamppost stands prominently on the right side of this walkway. In the background, multiple large, multi-story buildings dominate the left side, appearing to lean due to the wide-angle perspective, while a river with buildings on its far bank is visible to the right, bordered by a black railing.

end of description

The viewpoint steadily moves forward and slightly to the right along the walkway. The three figures on the steps in the bottom-left of the first frame gradually move out of view to the bottom-left. Concurrently, the group of people walking on the paved path moves further away and exits the frame to the right. The black lamppost on the right side of the walkway approaches and becomes more prominent in the foreground, while the background buildings and riverbank subtly shift to the left.
