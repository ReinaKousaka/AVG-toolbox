The first frame displays a wet, urban street at night. A dark asphalt road, reflective from rain, extends from the foreground to the distant center, marked with white arrows pointing away from the viewer and a yellow line on the right edge. Rows of green trees and bright streetlights line both sides of the road, receding into the background, with distant buildings featuring illuminated windows visible behind them. Colorful reflections of red, green, and blue lights from distant traffic are prominent on the wet road surface. A partially visible sign with Korean text stands on the far right, close to the viewer.

Throughout the frames, continuous rainfall creates subtle ripples on the wet road surface, causing the colorful light reflections to shimmer and shift dynamically. A blue bus gradually appears from the distant right side of the road, moving towards the viewer. It then proceeds to pass by the viewer, exiting the frame to the far right and momentarily obscuring parts of the rightmost background.

The first frame displays a wet, multi-lane asphalt road at night, stretching into the distance from the viewer's perspective. White lane markings, including an arrow pointing forward-right, are visible on the road's surface, reflecting red and white lights. To the viewer's immediate right is a sidewalk with a metal grate and a green sign featuring Korean text, while the left side features a row of trees illuminated by streetlights. Further down the road, more streetlights glow, and distant buildings with illuminated windows are discernible through the dark night, with traffic lights showing red and green ahead.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the scene remains largely static with no new objects appearing or existing objects moving. The most notable dynamic change observed is the very subtle shifting and shimmering of light reflections on the wet road surface, consistent with ongoing rainfall. No new scenes or objects are revealed, and the viewpoint remains fixed relative to the first frame.

The first frame shows a wet, dark city street at night, looking down a road that recedes into the distance. A wide, reflective asphalt road occupies the foreground and midground, featuring white and yellow lane markings; a metal grate is visible on the far right sidewalk. On the left, a row of green-leafed trees stands alongside the road, illuminated by streetlights, with buildings and more distant lights beyond them. On the right, another row of trees lines a sidewalk, and further down the road, distant vehicles appear as bright headlight blurs, with traffic lights showing red and green reflections on the wet surface.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, a white car with bright headlights emerges from the mid-distance on the left side of the road, moving steadily towards the viewer. The car continues to advance, driving past the viewer's immediate left and receding into the left foreground. Throughout this movement, subtle shimmering and ripples are visible on the wet road surface, indicating ongoing rainfall, while reflections of streetlights and distant traffic lights continuously shift with the car's progression and the wet conditions.
