The first frame presents a sunny urban street scene. To the immediate left, a light gray building wall extends alongside a sidewalk, which features a wooden barrier and two white delivery trucks parked in the midground, with a person in blue overalls standing near the first truck. To the right, a street with a red lane is bordered by a metal railing, beyond which pedestrians walk on a sidewalk in front of buildings, including one labeled "ARIZONA," while a white van is parked further along. Taller buildings and scaffolding are visible in the background under a clear sky.
end of description
The person in blue overalls, initially to the left of the first truck in the midground, moves dynamically around its front and right side. Simultaneously, pedestrians on the sidewalk across the street continue walking from right to left, further away from the viewer. A second individual in white gradually becomes more apparent standing between the two delivery trucks in the midground. The 'Cloudpoint' logo subtly appears on the building wall to the viewer's immediate left as the frames progress.

The first frame displays a city street with two white 'ART CORP' moving trucks prominently parked in the midground, slightly left of center, and a person in blue standing on the left sidewalk near a large white roll, behind a low brown fence. To the right, a red-paved road leads past an orange traffic cone and a metal barrier, with pedestrians walking on the far sidewalk in front of buildings. In the background, numerous multi-story buildings, including one with a 'LEVI'S' sign, rise under a clear blue sky, interspersed with utility poles.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, the person in blue on the left sidewalk actively pushes a hand truck further towards the viewer's left. Simultaneously, pedestrians on the far right sidewalk continue their movement within the scene, passing further along the street.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a city street with two white "0123 ART CORP" moving trucks parked on the left side, and a person in a blue uniform positioned near the front of the leftmost truck. In the foreground, a black railing, an orange traffic cone, and a concrete planter are visible towards the right and center, while residential buildings line the street on the right, with a white van visible further down.
end of description
The person in blue stands up and walks towards the far left, eventually exiting the frame. Concurrently, the white van on the right side of the street slowly moves forward, further down the road from its initial position, before moving out of sight.

The first frame displays an urban street scene under a clear sky. In the foreground, a dark utility pole stands slightly right of center, with a concrete planter containing foliage to its left and a metal barrier with an orange traffic cone to its right. Two white box trucks, both labeled "0123 ART CORP," are parked in the midground: the left truck is closer with blue traffic cones near its front, and the right truck is further down the street. Multi-story buildings line both sides of the street in the background, including one with a "LEVI'S" sign to the far right.

end of description

In the subsequent frames, the white box truck positioned on the left begins to move forward, progressively advancing away from the viewer. This movement gradually reveals previously obscured details on the sidewalk to the left of the truck's initial parking spot, including a blue tarp and some materials. The second truck on the right remains parked further down the street relative to the first-frame viewpoint, and the surrounding buildings remain stationary. The camera's perspective subtly shifts, maintaining a view of the street ahead as the left truck drives off.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a white FUSO box truck with "0123 ART CORP" branding is prominent in the foreground and mid-right, parked facing slightly left, with a blue and white traffic cone resting in front of its bumper. To its immediate right, a low concrete planter holds small green bushes, and behind the FUSO truck, a second identical white truck is partially visible. On the mid-left, a winding paved path is flanked by a lush garden featuring various green shrubs, spherical bushes, and a small tree; a blue tarp, white wrapped object, and a small ladder are on the ground near the garden. The background reveals urban buildings, some with reflective glass, lining a street, with a white van visible further down the path.
end of description
The foreground white FUSO truck begins to move forward and slightly to its right relative to its initial position. As it slowly exits the frame, a second identical white truck, previously partially obscured behind the first, is progressively revealed to the right of where the first truck was initially parked. The blue and white traffic cone, initially in front of the first truck, shifts slightly to its right as the truck moves. The path and distant buildings on the left become more visible as the moving truck clears the central-right portion of the scene.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame features a white truck dominating the right foreground, with its cab and front wheel visible, while a landscaped planter with numerous green bushes borders a paved path on the left. Beyond the path, multi-story buildings line the street, and a distant white vehicle is parked further down.

end of description

In subsequent frames, the white truck moves forward, away from the viewer, progressively revealing more of the paved street to its right. As it departs, red Japanese characters reading "アート引越センター" become fully visible along the side of its cargo box, which was previously obscured.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a street view with a large white and blue truck parked on the right, its side featuring Japanese text. On the left, a building with a glass facade is flanked by manicured bushes, a large white rock, and a blue traffic cone, while a person walks down the street in the distance. Another blue traffic cone is positioned near the truck's front wheel on the right.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the walking person in the distance moves closer towards the viewer, passing behind the white rock on the left. Concurrently, the back section of the white and blue truck on the right appears to open or expand, revealing more of its side. This action also makes a dark van, previously partially obscured and parked behind the truck further down the street, more prominent. The blue traffic cone initially on the far left subtly shifts further away from the viewer's original viewpoint.
