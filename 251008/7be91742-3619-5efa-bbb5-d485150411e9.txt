The first frame shows train tracks curving left into the distance, flanked by green vegetation and forested mountains under an overcast sky. On the near left, dense trees border a parallel, unused track, while on the right, green growth features a white and black striped marker pole, fence posts, and a utility pole further ahead. Faint yellow machinery is visible around the left bend of the tracks in the distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the striped marker pole on the right passes and exits the frame. The utility pole and its overhead wires approach, passing on the right, revealing a small brown structure behind it. The yellow machinery around the distant left curve becomes slightly clearer and closer as the landscape scrolls by on both sides.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows train tracks receding into the distance, curving gently left in the mid-ground. The tracks are surrounded by ballast, bordered by a green, forested embankment on the left and a sparser, dirtier slope on the right. A tall, dark utility pole stands to the right of the tracks, supporting overhead lines. In the distance along the curve, several yellow construction vehicles are visible near the tracks, while lush, forested mountains rise under an overcast sky. A small brown shed is on the far right embankment, and a bridge is partially visible on the far left.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the utility pole on the right moves closer and eventually exits the frame to the viewer's right, revealing more of the right embankment relative to its original position. The yellow construction vehicles, initially in the mid-ground, draw closer and appear further to the left of the tracks, with a new yellow and orange marker pole emerging on the left trackside. A concrete ring structure also appears on the left as the viewer progresses, and the bridge in the distant left becomes clearer.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a railway track running centrally, extending straight ahead and then gently curving left into the distance. To the immediate left, a grassy slope leads up to a gravel path ascending towards a cluster of pine trees, with mountains visible beyond. To the right of the tracks, two yellow excavators (one Caterpillar, one Liebherr) sit on a mound of gravel, flanked by construction markers and an electrical utility pole. In the background, forested hills frame a distant bridge that crosses over the tracks under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses along the tracks, the two yellow excavators on the right are passed, revealing a red container and more construction debris behind them. The utility pole on the right, now closer, displays a newly visible orange sign with the number '7'. Simultaneously, the gravel path on the left, and the underpass ahead, become increasingly prominent as the viewer approaches.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a railway track receding into the mid-ground, leading to a concrete bridge with an arched opening. To the left, a gravel path slopes upwards alongside a treed hill, with a wooden barrier lying near the track and utility poles further back. On the right, a grassy, treed hill slopes upwards, featuring a red container with objects inside and a partially obscured yellow bin behind it in the foreground, with another utility pole further back. Overhead lines traverse the frame, and a distant forested mountain is visible beyond the bridge under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the red container, yellow bin, and wooden barrier on the right and left foreground respectively disappear behind the viewer. The concrete bridge, initially in the mid-ground, approaches and passes overhead, while the tracks ahead continue under its arch. A black signal apparatus on a pole with a yellow sign, previously less distinct on the right, becomes clearer and draws closer to the viewer. The treed hills on both sides become more prominent and closer to the tracks as the viewpoint advances towards and beneath the bridge. Beyond the bridge, a distant forested mountain in the background becomes more defined as the tracks continue forward.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, the viewer looks directly down a railway track framed by steep, dark rocky walls on the left and right. An old stone arch bridge, topped with a modern barrier structure, spans overhead across these walls. Beyond the bridge, distant green mountains and utility poles are visible under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward, passing *under* the bridge and *between* the rocky walls, which then recede *behind* the initial position. The scene opens up *beyond* the first frame's confines, revealing a wider valley with extensive green hills and mountains, including a snow-capped peak appearing to the far left, and more utility poles lining the tracks.
