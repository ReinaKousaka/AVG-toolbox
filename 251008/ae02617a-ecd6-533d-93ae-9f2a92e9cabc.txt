The first frame depicts a rainy city street at night, viewed from a pedestrian's perspective. To the immediate right, a wet sidewalk features several trees and two parked electric scooters (one green, one blue), with a white car partially visible behind a tree. Across the street to the left, a wet road reflects city lights, bordered by buildings displaying illuminated windows and colorful neon signs, where two parked black cars, a motorcycle, and a pedestrian holding an umbrella are visible in the midground.

In the following frames, the white car on the right side of the street gradually moves forward, pulling away from the viewer along the curb. Concurrently, the pedestrian with the umbrella on the opposite side of the road briefly walks further left before coming to a stop, as the rain continues to fall consistently.

The first frame depicts a rainy city street at night, featuring a green and a purple scooter on a wet sidewalk in the foreground, positioned next to a prominent tree trunk and utility pole. A wet road, with two parked dark cars on the left and a white car on the right further down, runs between the foreground and illuminated city buildings lining both sides of the street.

Subsequently, a white car appears in the midground, driving towards the viewer on the left side of the street, followed by a dark gray SUV that travels from the mid-left, passing the foreground tree trunk. Concurrently, the green scooter subtly shifts towards the bottom-left of the frame, and a new white sedan becomes visible further back in the mid-left, driving behind the SUV.

The first frame captures a rainy night street with a purple electric scooter and a gray trash can positioned in the right foreground. Behind them, a white car is parked beside a tree, while a dark SUV drives away from the viewer on the wet, reflective road lined with illuminated buildings and streetlights in the background.
end of description
The dark SUV moves further down the street, and a black car behind it in the left lane also drives away from the viewer. Subsequently, two red cars with illuminated taillights appear sequentially in the distance on the left side of the street, driving towards the background. An orange lid is newly visible on the trash can positioned to the right of the viewer. Finally, a person on a scooter with a large yellow delivery box rapidly travels into view from the left, moving away from the viewer down the street.
