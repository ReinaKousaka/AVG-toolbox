The first frame depicts a wet urban street on an overcast day. In the foreground, a dark asphalt road with double yellow lines curves gently right, while a cobblestone sidewalk with a dark metal guardrail and some green foliage occupies the bottom right. In the midground, buildings with storefronts and Korean signs line the left, featuring an "ART WORKS GALLERY" and a yellow awning, with several people holding umbrellas on the sidewalk in front of them. On the right, a person with a dark umbrella walks away on the sidewalk, below trees, while distant buildings and street signs are visible in the background under a grey sky.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the person with the dark umbrella on the right sidewalk steadily walks further away from the viewer. Concurrently, the group of people on the left sidewalk, in front of the buildings, exhibit subtle movements, some advancing down the street while others remain stationary, all keeping their umbrellas up due to the persistent rain.

The first frame displays a wet, rain-slicked street ascending towards the background, bordered on the left by multi-story buildings adorned with Korean signage and on the right by a sidewalk separated by a low metal barrier. In the midground, several people holding umbrellas are gathered near storefronts on the left, while a single pedestrian carrying an umbrella walks away from the viewer on the right sidewalk, passing signs including a red stop sign and a yellow '30' speed limit marker.

As the frames progress, the cluster of people beneath umbrellas in the midground subtly shifts their positions. Concurrently, the lone pedestrian on the right sidewalk continues moving further away from the first-frame viewpoint, receding into the background. A white car also emerges in the midground street, traveling uphill towards the background before eventually driving out of view.

The first frame displays a rainy urban street with a wet asphalt road featuring a prominent red lane marked with a white '30' speed limit and Korean text, alongside a wet paved sidewalk on the right separated by a low black metal fence. Multi-story buildings with various storefronts and illuminated Korean signs line the left, while a red 'STOP' sign, a yellow '30' speed limit sign, and a digital display showing '109' are visible on the right sidewalk, with several umbrella-carrying pedestrians and a white car in the midground.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the pedestrians on the left sidewalk move towards the viewer, and an individual on the right sidewalk walks away. Concurrently, a white car drives further down the street into the background as rain consistently falls, creating visible ripples on the glistening wet surfaces of the road and sidewalk.
