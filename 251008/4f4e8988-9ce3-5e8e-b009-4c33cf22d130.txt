The first frame shows a traditional Japanese general store with its front open, displaying numerous woven baskets on shelves and a table, alongside brooms hanging inside and a bundle of brooms standing vertically to the right of the entrance. A paved sidewalk with a yellow tactile strip runs in the foreground, with an adjacent wooden gate on the far right and a brick building visible to the far left.

Subsequently, the camera smoothly pans slightly to the viewer's left, progressively revealing more of the brick building and street to the viewer's left. This movement causes the wooden gate and brooms on the viewer's right to shift closer to the frame's right edge, and a small green circular sign becomes fully visible, newly revealed, hanging near the upper right inside the shop entrance.
