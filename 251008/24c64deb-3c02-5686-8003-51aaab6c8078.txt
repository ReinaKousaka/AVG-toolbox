The first frame displays a park with a paved path and a low rope fence on the left in the foreground, leading to a green-tinted pond teeming with numerous yellow and orange koi fish in the midground. Beyond the pond, a small bridge, rocky landscaping, lush green trees, a white building with red shutters to the left, and a grey stone church tower on the far right are visible under an overcast sky.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the most significant dynamic change is the continuous swimming and regrouping of the yellow and orange koi fish within the pond's green water, constantly shifting their patterns relative to the initial viewpoint. Additionally, the camera subtly pans slightly to the right, gradually revealing a bit more of the pond's right edge and the church tower.
