In the first frame, a gray asphalt road occupies the lower center, curving slightly left into the distance and marked by a white line on its left edge. To the left, a large, barren, dark gray mountain slope rises from the mid-ground towards the top left. To the right, a similar rocky, barren slope ascends from the road edge to the top right. Ahead on the road, a dark SUV is visible in the mid-distance, and slightly to its right, a dark brown wooden signpost with two blank horizontal planks stands by the roadside. A thin dark pole is positioned on the left side of the road, further into the curve, while a clear blue sky fills the upper third of the frame.

As the viewpoint progresses, the dark SUV, initially located ahead on the road, slowly approaches the viewer. The wooden signpost, initially positioned to the right of the road ahead, also draws nearer and enlarges. Similarly, the thin dark pole on the left side of the road ahead approaches the viewer. Eventually, the signpost exits the frame to the right, signifying it has passed the original first-frame viewpoint's lateral position. The immediate rocky slopes on both sides of the road also become more defined as the viewer advances.

In the first frame, a paved road stretches from the foreground into the middle distance, curving towards the right around a barren, dark grey mountain peak. A dark grey SUV is positioned on this road, slightly right of center, facing away from the viewer. To the left, a taller, equally barren mountain rises, and a dark vertical post stands on the left edge of the road in the mid-ground. The background reveals distant mountains and a vast, clear blue sky overhead.
end of description
The dark grey SUV moves progressively further away from the viewer and towards the right, appearing smaller as it continues along the road. Concurrently, the vertical post on the left edge of the road shifts closer to the viewer and exits the frame to the left. As the viewpoint advances, the SUV eventually exits the frame to the right, revealing more of the winding road ahead. A segment of another road becomes visible far in the distance, to the right and behind the initial right mountain, as the scene unfolds.

The first frame displays a paved road with white dashed lines leading from the viewer, curving left between two large, dark, rocky mountains under a clear blue sky. A small, dark vehicle is visible in the mid-distance on the left curve of the road, with smaller, lighter hills far in the background to the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the dark vehicle, positioned ahead and to the left in the mid-distance, approaches the viewer, becoming larger and revealing its red color. Simultaneously, a dark pole-like structure emerges and grows prominent on the left side of the road, beside the left mountain, as the car continues its direct forward movement towards the first-frame viewpoint.
