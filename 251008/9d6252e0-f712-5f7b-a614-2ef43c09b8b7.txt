First, a street scene features a crosswalk in the middle ground, where several people, some pushing bikes, are walking from left to right. To the viewer's left, buildings and parked bicycles line a sidewalk, alongside green poles with a red traffic light. On the right, a street lane marked by orange cones extends into the distance, bordered by trees under a partly cloudy sky, with distant cyclists visible. end of description
Subsequently, the foreground group and their bikes continue moving right across the crosswalk, while the person on the blue public bike in the mid-right cycles further left. A new person in a light green dress emerges from the mid-right of the frame, walking leftward as other distant cyclists proceed along the street.
