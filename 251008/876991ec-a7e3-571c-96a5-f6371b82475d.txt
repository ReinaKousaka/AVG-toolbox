The first frame displays a wet, grey-tiled pathway extending into the mid-distance, flanked by buildings and parked cars. To the left, a multi-story building features a glass-paneled lower section with green foliage and an evergreen tree, and an illuminated entryway further back. A row of parked vehicles, including black, white, and blue cars, occupies the gravel area along the right side, with green trees overhead in the upper right.

In frame 5, a translucent water streak briefly appears across the upper central foreground, indicating a droplet on the camera's lens or an immediate surface. Subsequently, starting from frame 7, small white specks denoting falling raindrops become visible across the entire scene, reflecting an increase in rainfall. This rainfall continues and is slightly more pronounced in frames 8 and 9, filling the air and landing on the ground and cars within the established outdoor setting.
