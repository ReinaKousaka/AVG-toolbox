First, the initial frame displays a road winding into a valley, with a dark blue car partially visible in the bottom-left foreground and a line of vehicles extending ahead. A tall, light-colored wall borders the road on the right, behind which evergreen and bare trees stand, while a majestic, snow-dusted grey mountain forms the backdrop on the left.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the dark blue car exits left, and a grey car behind it becomes the prominent vehicle in the left foreground, followed by a black SUV. Concurrently, a pedestrian in dark clothing appears on the sidewalk to the far left, moving towards the viewer, and a red and white crane is progressively revealed further right, initially obscured by trees.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a road with a black SUV immediately to the viewer's left, followed by a line of other cars. To the far left, a grey wall precedes a steep, snow-capped mountain featuring houses on its lower slopes, while to the right, a beige wall borders evergreen and bare trees.
end of description
Subsequently, the black SUV exits the frame to the left, progressively revealing a black hatchback behind it, and a person on a bicycle emerges on the left sidewalk. As the hatchback moves forward, a new black Mazda sedan enters the frame from behind the viewer on the left, continuing the flow of traffic down the mountain-flanked road.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a multi-lane road extends ahead from the viewer's perspective. To the immediate left, a dark car partially obscures a concrete retaining wall, behind which a person walks, and a silver car approaches in the opposing lane. A majestic, snow-capped mountain range rises steeply in the distant background, with scattered houses on its lower slopes. To the right, a sidewalk borders a light-colored building with large garage doors, followed by a street lamp and more buildings and trees further down the street.
end of description
As the frames progress, the dark car in the immediate left foreground moves out of view to the left. The silver car, initially approaching in the opposing lane to the left of the viewpoint, passes by and exits the frame to the left, as a person on a bicycle with a passenger appears from behind the left wall and moves past the viewer. Simultaneously, the white building to the right moves out of view to the right, revealing an intersection and more of the road and buildings ahead. A new dark car appears on the far left, driving towards the viewpoint, while green road markings become visible further ahead on the right side of the road.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A snow-capped mountain range dominates the background from the left to center, with a road leading away from the viewer in the foreground. To the immediate left, a black SUV approaches, while a white car moves away further ahead on the same road. On the right, a multi-story building with balconies stands near a parking area with several cars and two tall conifer trees.
end of description
The black SUV on the immediate left moves closer to the viewer, then out of frame to the left. A dark blue car with yellow stripes then appears on the left side, slightly behind where the SUV was, moving towards and past the viewer. Concurrently, the white car ahead moves further away, gradually revealing more of the road and a pedestrian crossing directly ahead of the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The viewer is on a road approaching a pedestrian crossing marked with yellow stripes, featuring a central island with striped poles and a blue pedestrian sign. A blue car with yellow markings is positioned to the immediate left of the viewer, while a multi-story building with balconies and several parked cars are on the right. In the distance, a large mountain range with some snow dominates the background under a clear sky, with other buildings and a tall evergreen tree visible along the road's edge.
end of description
The blue car on the viewer's left moves forward and exits the frame. The viewer then progresses past the pedestrian crossing, causing the crossing sign and island to appear to the viewer's left. A dark SUV, initially further back on the left, proceeds across the crossing and continues ahead, as the white car previously in front of the viewer recedes into the distance. The bus stop structure on the right becomes fully visible as the viewer passes the parked cars, revealing the road ahead more clearly.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a road scene with a dark blue car on the immediate left of the viewer and a white car driving ahead in the same lane. To the left, a cream-colored building with green shutters and a tall cypress tree stands against a backdrop of a vast, rocky mountain range with snowy peaks, while to the right, a white bridge railing and more buildings are visible further down the road.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the dark blue car on the left moves forward and out of frame. The viewer's perspective advances, causing the white car ahead to move further away and the mountain range, along with the cream-colored building on the left, to shift out of view towards the left. A new light blue car emerges from the left lane, passing the viewer as a bus stop sign becomes visible further ahead on the right.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, the viewer is on a road with a solid white line on the left and dashed lines on the right, indicating driving lanes. A blue sedan is in the left lane, slightly to the left and approaching the viewer. Further ahead in the left lane, a white SUV is visible. To the far left stands a multi-story building with green shutters, flanked by trees. To the far right, across a barrier/railing, is another multi-story building with a bus stop sign. Dominating the background is a massive, rugged mountain range, partly snow-capped, rising above the road and structures.
end of description
The viewer's perspective moves forward along the road. The blue sedan passes the viewer to the left and exits the frame, while the white SUV and other distant vehicles approach and then recede. The building on the far left and the one on the far right shift outwards, growing larger before passing beyond the edges of the initial viewpoint. As the scene progresses, a dark car appears in the left lane, positioning itself behind the white SUV relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
