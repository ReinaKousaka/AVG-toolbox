The first frame displays a wet, paved road extending forward, flanked by a concrete wall on the left and an ivy-covered stone wall on the right. To the left, a brown multi-story building with a white van parked in front is visible, while a tall waterfall cascades down distant, lush green mountains under an overcast sky.

Across the following frames, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly to the viewer's left. This movement reveals more of the immediate foreground road and the lower section of the concrete wall to the viewer's left, making the distant waterfall appear slightly more centered within the mountain landscape.
