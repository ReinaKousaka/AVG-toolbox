The first frame depicts a wet, rainy city street at night, featuring a brightly lit row of shops with numerous Korean signs lining the right, where colorful paper lanterns and an A-frame sign are partially visible. On the left, a low concrete barrier with a wheelchair accessibility sign parallels the viewer, extending towards a busy street with distant vehicle lights and buildings.

As the viewer moves forward, the colorful lanterns and A-frame sign initially on the far right move out of view, while the shops on the right, featuring a 'W' sign and green diamond light, become progressively closer and more detailed. Concurrently, the concrete barrier on the left passes by, revealing new numerical markings and decorative patterns along its length, continuously positioned to the viewer's left.

The first frame depicts a wet, nighttime street in a city during rainfall. In the foreground to the left, a low, grey stone wall runs horizontally, featuring a yellow sign with "Entrance 2" text. Further left and slightly behind the wall, a tall black pole displays multiple illuminated signs for subway lines and the 'Jongno 3-ga' station. The street's wet pavement, reflecting the numerous bright, colorful neon signs of storefronts lining the right side of the path, extends into the distance. In the mid-ground, a glass structure stands left of the path, with distant city lights visible under the dark, rainy sky.

The subsequent frames show the rainfall continuing steadily across the visible street, enhancing the reflective quality of the wet surfaces and appearing as visible streaks throughout the air. Minor camera adjustments cause subtle shifts in the exact framing of the foreground 'Entrance 2' sign and the illuminated subway pole signs, but no new objects or scenes emerge from behind the viewer, to the sides, or within containers. The overall perspective of the street and buildings remains consistent.

In the first frame, a wet, reflective urban street scene at night is visible. To the left, a low grey stone wall extends into the midground, with a tall dark pole displaying illuminated vertical signs further left. A row of parked bicycles, predominantly yellow and green, are to the left of the central sidewalk, near a glass-enclosed shelter. The right side is dominated by a continuous line of storefronts with dark grates or shutters, featuring various illuminated signs in red and yellow extending into the distance. Rain is visibly falling, creating diagonal streaks across the view, especially prominent towards the right, and bright reflections on the wet ground and distant buildings from streetlights and building signs.
end of description
Across the subsequent frames, the primary dynamic change is the increasingly visible and slightly intensifying rainfall, seen as numerous diagonal streaks falling throughout the scene directly in front of the viewer. The reflective surfaces of the wet street and buildings continue to shimmer with light, and the overall atmospheric effect of the rain becomes more pronounced, though no new objects or scenes are revealed relative to the initial viewpoint.
