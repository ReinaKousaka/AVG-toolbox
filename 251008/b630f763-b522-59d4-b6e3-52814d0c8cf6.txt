The first frame shows a multi-lane urban road extending from the foreground into the midground. White arrow markings on the asphalt indicate options to proceed straight or turn left. To the viewer's left, a dark car is turning, and several multi-story buildings, interspersed with green trees, line the street. In the center midground, a green island features trees, a bus stop shelter, and a pole with multiple blue directional and 'P' parking signs. To the viewer's right, another dark car is visible on the road, with a large building featuring a vertical yellow 'HOTEL' sign and a green traffic light on the sidewalk. Cloudy skies dominate the upper portion of the frame.

In subsequent frames, the dark car on the left continues its turn, eventually moving out of view, while the car on the right also moves forward and out of sight. The viewer's perspective advances, causing the bus stop shelter, the pole with directional signs, and a red and white striped barrier on the right to become progressively closer and larger. The 'BUS' road marking, initially partially obscured by the car on the right, is gradually revealed and becomes fully visible directly in front of the viewer.

The first frame presents a street-level view from a vehicle. In the foreground, an asphalt road displays white lane markings, including straight and left-turn arrows, and a white pedestrian crosswalk extends to the right. To the viewer's left, green trees partially obscure a tall brown building, while an ornate classical building with scaffolding and balconies stands beyond an intersection, where a green traffic light and a dark car are visible. To the right, a bus stop shelter with a bench and advertisement, accompanied by a tall pole featuring multiple blue and white directional road signs, is positioned next to more green trees under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint gradually moves forward, revealing more of the classical building on the left. The content on the various road signs attached to the tall pole on the right repeatedly changes its displayed destinations and information. From frame 4, a large, light-colored truck emerges from the left and slowly traverses the intersection ahead of the viewer, moving towards the right side of the frame. By frame 8, a new red and white triangular warning sign appears below the yellow directional sign on the right pole.

In the first frame, a multi-lane road occupies the foreground, extending from the viewer with white lane markings and a red-painted bicycle lane on the right. Directly ahead and to the right, a five-story building with a light-colored facade, balconies, and scaffolding stands at an intersection, with a taller reddish-brown building behind it to the left. On the far right, a yellow directional sign, a red triangular warning sign, and a green traffic light are mounted on a pole, partially obscured by green trees.

end of description

The camera steadily moves forward through the intersection. The yellow directional sign, red triangular warning sign, and the green traffic light on the right progressively shift upwards and to the right out of the frame. A blue circular sign appears below the yellow sign. A light blue car becomes more prominent among other parked vehicles on the street to the right of the corner building. By the final frame, the viewer has passed the initial traffic signs and light pole, bringing the corner building and the red bicycle lane significantly closer and more central.
