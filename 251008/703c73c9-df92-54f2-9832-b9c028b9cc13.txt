The first frame shows a narrow, covered alleyway with a wooden wall and a red traffic cone on the left, and a wooden-paneled shop entrance partially covered by a blue tarp on the right. Two individuals walk away from the viewer down the illuminated path, under a translucent roof, with other figures visible further in the distance.

As the scene progresses, a man approaches from deeper in the alley on the right, holding a cup, and walks past the viewer's initial position. Simultaneously, the viewer advances, revealing more graffiti on the left wall and a vending machine further down on the right. Subsequently, a masked couple appears from the alley's far end, walking towards the viewer's new vantage point.
