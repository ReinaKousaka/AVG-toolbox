Throughout the subsequent frames, the dense crowd continually shifts, with individuals like the person in the blue cap moving closer to the viewer's immediate left and then passing, as others move further into the distance. New people progressively appear in the foreground from the right and left sides, including a person in a patterned jacket advancing from the far right.

In the immediate foreground, facing away, are individuals including a person in a black hoodie on the far left, another in a black hat and light blue top center-left, and a person in a black shirt center-right. Further into the midground, a person in a white varsity jacket is visible, while to the right, closer to the viewer, stand individuals in a blue shawl and a striped shirt, all amidst a dense crowd navigating a narrow street lined with glowing neon signs and storefronts under a dark sky, with a white construction barrier on the left.

As the frames progress, the crowd subtly shifts, and figures in the foreground move relative to the viewer's fixed position. The person in the striped shirt and the person in the blue shawl on the right move forward and further right, revealing more of the street. Subsequently, a police officer in uniform emerges into view on the far right, from behind the original foreground figures, and a woman in a light brown top with a white bag also enters the right foreground, moving forward.
