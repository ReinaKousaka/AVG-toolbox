The first frame displays a laundry room with a light-colored countertop and dark green base cabinets along the lower-left, surmounted by matching green upper cabinets on the left. To the right of the cabinets and directly in front of the viewer are two stacked pairs of white washing machines and dryers. Above the machines, to the right of the upper cabinets, are dark green open shelves, while a light-colored wall forms the background on the far right.

The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing the full extent of the two stacked white washer and dryer units positioned directly in front and to the right of the initial viewpoint. More of the light-colored wall and the green open shelving above the machines become visible further to the right. Eventually, a doorway opening emerges on the far right side of the room, behind the rightmost washer/dryer stack, as the light-tiled floor beneath the machines also becomes more prominent.
