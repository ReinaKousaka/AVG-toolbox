The first frame captures a restaurant interior with multiple dining tables, set with white tablecloths and cutlery, surrounded by burnt orange chairs dominating the foreground and midground left. A light wooden slatted partition stands centrally, flanked by a dark, vertical slatted wall featuring diagonal embedded warm lights on its right, separating the dining area from a brightly lit hallway. To the far left, a glass railing overlooks an expansive, bright open area with tall black floor lamps, while the hallway on the right showcases a geometric patterned carpet and, further back, an exit sign and restroom icon.

Across subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly and slowly pans to the right, gradually revealing slightly more of the patterned carpet and the hallway scene to the viewer's right. Concurrently, the leftmost dining tables and a portion of the glass railing become marginally less prominent as they shift further towards the left edge of the frame.
