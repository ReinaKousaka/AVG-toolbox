The first frame depicts an urban sidewalk scene looking down a tree-lined street. In the foreground left, a white utility cart is partially visible. A group of people stand on the mid-ground left sidewalk, next to a white truck with an open rear, all beneath the canopy of large green trees that line the street. In the center, stacks of blue, green, and red wheeled crates are arranged on the sidewalk. To the right, a modern building with large pillars and glass windows rises, elevated by steps from the sidewalk, with planters featuring greenery along its base and on the sidewalk. Tall buildings recede into the background.

The camera slowly pans to the right, causing the group of people and the white truck on the left to gradually move further left and partially out of frame relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the stacks of colorful crates shift left, revealing more of the building's facade and the planter on the right side of the sidewalk. A pedestrian also becomes visible walking down the street in the distant background, moving towards the viewer.

First, the frame displays a bustling urban sidewalk with a modern building featuring glass windows and light columns on the right, and a tree-lined street on the left. In the foreground right, a planter with red flowers sits on the wide pavement, while rows of empty blue, green, and red wheeled carts line the left sidewalk near several standing and walking pedestrians. Further left, a truck is partially visible beyond the trees, and more people are seen walking into the distance along the street. end of description. Subsequently, the individuals on the left sidewalk begin to move: a person in a dark shirt walks forward, partially obscuring another in a red shirt who subtly shifts, while pedestrians further down the street and near the building entrance also show minor movements. The overall scene remains constant, with no new objects or areas revealed from the static first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame presents a sidewalk leading into the distance, flanked by a modern building with large columns and glass windows on the right, and a street lined with trees and distant buildings on the left. Several blue and red rolling carts are prominently positioned on the sidewalk in the mid-ground, left of center, while a few people are visible near the distant building entrance and along the far-off street.
end of description
A black car emerges from the distant street on the left, driving towards the right side of the frame before disappearing behind the building on the right. Throughout the sequence, pedestrians continue to walk along the distant sidewalk and street.

The first frame shows an urban sidewalk alongside a tall building with prominent vertical columns on the right, and a tree-lined street on the left. Several red, and a few blue, metal trolleys are positioned in the immediate foreground to the left of the viewer. A paved sidewalk extends into the distance, adorned with flower planters and populated by pedestrians in the mid-ground further along the path. end of description. The camera remains static while pedestrians move along the sidewalk. A person in a red outfit walks from the background towards the mid-ground left, and another figure in dark clothing passes behind the trolleys on the far left.

First, red barriers and a partially visible person are on the far left, with a modern building and green bushes on the right. A paved sidewalk extends forward, lined with trees, flower planters, and pedestrians walking away, with tall buildings receding on the right under a bright sky.
end of description
Next, the partially obscured person on the left moves forward pushing a red cart, while another person pushing a blue cart emerges behind them, continuing along the sidewalk as other pedestrians also move away from the viewer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a wide city sidewalk stretching into the distance, bordered by a treelined street on the left with pedestrians, and a modern building on the right featuring reflective panels, planters with green bushes, and steps. In the foreground on the left, a person in a reddish-orange dress pushes a cart towards the viewer, while other pedestrians walk further down the sidewalk away from the viewer.
end of description.
The person in the red dress and cart moves further left, out of the frame relative to the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, a person in a black shirt and white top, initially in the mid-ground, walks along the sidewalk towards the viewer, passing the flower planters. This person then approaches the viewer's position before continuing along the path as distant pedestrians persist in moving away along the treelined street.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a city street looking forward from a tiled sidewalk, with large green trees lining a road with a green traffic light and pedestrians on the left. A modern building with silver facades and bushes in planters borders the right side of the sidewalk.
end of description
The masked woman on the left sidewalk progressively walks closer towards the viewer. Concurrently, a white minivan emerges from behind the buildings on the mid-right, slowly descending a ramp onto the street and moving leftward across the frame.
