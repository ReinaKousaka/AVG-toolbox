end of description
The person with the clear umbrella on the left steadily moves away from the viewer and to the left, gradually exiting the frame from the bottom-left corner. Concurrently, the person with the dark umbrella in the middle ground also progresses further down the street, moving away from the viewer. No new objects or scenes are revealed as the camera remains stationary.

The first frame captures a wet, narrow street under a clear umbrella canopy. To the left, a long stone arched structure houses various shops, with a prominent blue and white storefront visible in the foreground. To the right, a multi-story building with white hoarding extends down the street, where a few indistinct figures walk ahead in the distance.
end of description
As the camera moves forward along the street, objects ahead, such as the distant figures and subsequent arched shops, appear closer to the initial viewpoint. The orange sign on the right building, initially ahead and to the right, transitions into a dynamic display, and a yellow post, also ahead on the right, comes more clearly into view as the first-frame viewpoint progresses towards it.

The first frame depicts a wet urban street scene looking straight ahead. To the left, a large concrete archway structure stretches into the distance, beneath which a storefront with a blue awning and Japanese signage, along with other businesses displaying red lanterns, are visible. A person in dark clothing stands further down under this archway. To the right, a multi-story building lines a narrow sidewalk, where another person holding an umbrella walks away from the viewer, past a yellow barrier. Overcast skies and distant skyscrapers are visible in the background.

end of description

In subsequent frames, the person on the right, further down the street, continues walking away from the viewer, moving deeper into the scene. All other visible objects, including the buildings, archway, and stationary person on the left, remain in their initial spatial positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
