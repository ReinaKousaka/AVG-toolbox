In the first frame, a two-lane asphalt road with white markings extends from the bottom center into the middle distance. To the far right, a dark blue SUV is partially visible beneath a light-colored building overhang, which occupies the upper right portion of the frame. Adjacent to the road on the right stands a grey, curved building, prominently displaying "Garage Wolfsberg" signage in blue and yellow, with large windows and several cars parked in front. On the left side of the road, green ground leads to stacks of wooden materials and railway lines, beyond which snow-capped mountains and a dark green treed hillside are visible in the background, all under an overcast sky with the bright sun low in the upper left.

As the viewer moves forward along the road, the blue SUV on the right becomes fully visible as the building overhang recedes upwards, revealing a parked yellow vehicle behind it. The "Garage Wolfsberg" building on the right gradually reveals more of its curved facade and the parked cars, with its prominent yellow and blue logo becoming clearer as it shifts further into view before eventually moving out of frame on the right. Simultaneously, the stacked wooden materials and railway lines on the left draw nearer to the viewer, eventually passing to the immediate left. A Swiss flag and a "SUBARU" pole sign are revealed further along the right side of the building as the viewpoint advances.

The first frame shows a two-lane road in the foreground, extending towards the center of the frame. To the left, a metal guardrail runs alongside railroad tracks with overhead power lines, leading to distant snow-capped mountains. On the right, a gray building with large windows is prominent, accompanied by a blue Subaru sign and two flags (one red, one red and white), with a partially visible parked car behind a guardrail in the lower right. The background features a grassy, tree-covered slope rising to the right, and the sun shines low in the overcast sky to the left of center.
end of description
As the viewer's car moves forward, the gray building, Subaru sign, and flags on the right quickly recede and move out of view to the right. The grassy slope and a stone retaining wall, initially obscured by the building on the right, become fully visible and continue alongside the road. The railroad tracks and snow-capped mountains on the left side remain a constant presence. Progressing further, a tunnel entrance in the distance becomes clearly visible straight ahead on the road, while the sun remains in the upper left-center of the sky.

The first frame shows a road curving slightly right from a forward viewpoint, with a concrete barrier and a steep, dark mountainside on the left, and a stone wall with a grassy slope and bare trees on the right. A utility pole structure is visible above the left barrier, while the sun shines brightly in the upper left sky, ahead of a distant vehicle on the road.
end of description
As frames progress, the road ahead and the objects on either side advance towards the viewer, with the concrete barrier and stone wall receding from the foreground. The distant mountains and the forest on the right become more prominent, while a dark tunnel entrance gradually emerges directly in the path ahead.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a two-lane road curving gently right towards a dark arched bridge ahead. A concrete barrier lines the road's left side, with a complex, dark multi-level structure visible behind it and a snow-capped mountain further left. To the right, a stone retaining wall borders a grassy slope topped with bare trees. A bright sun shines from an overcast sky above, with a small vehicle visible under the distant bridge.
end of description
As the viewer drives forward, the road's markings and immediate surroundings like the concrete barrier and stone wall recede. The dark, multi-level structure on the left and the arched bridge ahead grow progressively larger and closer to the viewer. The small vehicle initially under the bridge also approaches, moving towards the viewer's position. The mountain and wooded hillside on either side appear to pass by as the perspective shifts forward.
