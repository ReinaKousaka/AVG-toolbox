The first frame captures a rainy city night from a sidewalk viewpoint, with a light pole, tree trunk, and two purple electric scooters prominently on the left foreground, and a brightly lit building facade on the right. Directly ahead, a wide, wet zebra crossing reflects the vibrant city lights from multiple buildings in the background and a black car with illuminated headlights paused in the midground, amidst numerous street signs and trees lining the distant streets.

Subsequently, a white car drives from the far left of the midground across the zebra crossing towards the right side of the frame, its motion blurring slightly due to speed, creating streaks of reflection on the wet road. As the white car exits the right midground, a new green object, possibly an umbrella or awning, partially enters the scene from the top, directly above the foreground tree, in the final frame.
