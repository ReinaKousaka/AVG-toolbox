In the foreground, three cows are walking from left to right on a wet, dark gray paved surface. On the far left, a light brown cow with a large dark bell shows its back and left side, with a partial human arm guiding it. Centered, a light brown and white cow, adorned with a colorful headpiece of streamers and baubles on a green base and a large dark bell, faces slightly right. To the right, another light brown and white cow, seen from its mid-section downwards, also walks right. In the midground, behind the cows, is a storefront with large glass windows reflecting light, showcasing mannequins dressed in traditional attire inside. The background consists of a light-colored awning above the storefront and a dark brown building facade.

As the cows move right, the central decorated cow's headpiece shifts, and a fourth decorated cow with a bell, bearing a Swiss flag emblem, is revealed emerging from behind the second cow, eventually taking position to the right of it. People become more visible in the background, walking both left and right inside and in front of the storefronts previously obscured by the cows. A person in a blue jacket is seen walking left-to-right behind the cows in the midground, and later, a person on a bicycle appears further down the street to the far right of the scene.
