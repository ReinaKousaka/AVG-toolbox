The first frame shows a busy street intersection from the viewpoint of a pedestrian, featuring the back of a person in a light sweater on the left foreground and another in a green sweatshirt on the right foreground, both standing on a white crosswalk. In the midground, numerous pedestrians are crossing the street, while a white bus and several cars are stationary on the road to the left, flanked by tall city buildings on both sides.

Subsequently, the pedestrians on the crosswalk continue their movement across the intersection from right to left, and some move from the far side towards the viewer's right. The person in the green sweatshirt briefly turns their head to the left, and the traffic on the street to the left remains stationary, indicating ongoing pedestrian activity at the crossing.

The first frame depicts a busy city street from a pedestrian's perspective, with the backs of two people prominent in the immediate foreground. In the midground, numerous pedestrians are actively crossing the street on a white-striped crosswalk, moving both towards the left and towards the right of the viewer, with a white bus and cars visible further down the street to the left. Tall urban buildings line both sides of the street in the background.

As the frames progress, the pedestrians in the midground continue to move across the crosswalk, gradually vacating the central area while new individuals emerge. A man in a beige striped cardigan becomes more visible from the right side, crossing left and smiling, while previously obscured people advance further into the scene. Later, a woman in a black jacket, looking at her phone, appears from the right side of the crosswalk and moves left. The two foreground figures remain largely stationary throughout the sequence.
