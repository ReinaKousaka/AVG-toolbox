The first frame depicts a modern building with a light facade and numerous windows on the left, turning a corner, with a cobblestone street extending into the background, flanked by wooden planter benches in the foreground and midground, and several green electric scooters parked on the far left, while distant people are visible on the street.

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint pans slowly right and slightly recedes, unveiling more of the cobblestone street and buildings towards the far right background, including an older structure with a green roof and a yellow building with 'IMAN' visible. Concurrently, people move along the street; a person in red, initially seen mid-left, advances deeper into the scene towards the right, demonstrating the dynamic activity.

In the first frame, a cobblestone street stretches into the distance, lined by buildings under a pale blue sky. To the immediate left, a large wooden planter with greenery and an attached wooden seating structure are prominent. On the far right foreground, another wooden seating structure is partially visible, behind which stands a yellow triangular street sign with black arrows. A modern building with many windows dominates the left side, while on the right, a tree and a building with a "MARKET" sign are seen in the midground.

The camera subtly shifts leftward, slightly widening the view of the modern building on the left. Throughout the frames, multiple individuals walk along the street, moving from the midground towards the foreground. Two specific people, one in a red top, move from the midground on the left towards the viewer, eventually walking past the left-side planter and out of frame. A green electric scooter is briefly visible to the far left of the planter in the later frames.
