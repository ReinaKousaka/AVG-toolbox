In the first frame, a wide asphalt road curves from the lower-left towards the mid-ground, with two individuals walking away from the viewer in the road's center. To the left of the road, a parking area with multiple parked cars is visible, bordered by a row of trees displaying vibrant yellow-orange foliage. On the right, a grassy verge leads to a large green tree, behind which blue tarp-covered objects are partially seen, while the background features forested hills under a blue sky with scattered clouds.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the road, causing the two people to walk further into the mid-ground relative to the viewpoint. The blue tarp-covered objects, initially to the far right, become slightly more central and seemingly closer as the perspective shifts. Concurrently, the on-screen overlay dynamically updates, showing the 'Pace' decreasing from 5:20 km to 5:10 km and the 'Grade' changing from -2% to -3%.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts an outdoor scene under a blue sky with scattered clouds, showcasing a paved road curving left from the foreground. To the left, a light-colored building and mountains are visible in the distance. A prominent row of trees with vibrant yellow and orange autumn foliage lines the middle ground, behind which a parking lot with several cars can be seen. On the far right, a large green tree stands, and two individuals, one pushing a stroller, are walking away from the viewer in the lower-middle.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the two individuals walking in the lower-middle continue to move forward along the road, receding further away from the viewer's initial viewpoint. Concurrently, the white car on the road to the left also advances, moving away from the viewer. The entire landscape, including the autumn trees and distant mountains, gradually shifts as the viewpoint progresses forward, causing objects to appear further away relative to their initial positions.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a paved path leading away from the viewer, with two people pushing a stroller in the foreground, adjacent to a row of vibrant orange trees on the right and a curving road with a white car and building to the left, all beneath a blue sky with distant mountains.

end of description

As the frames progress, the two individuals with the stroller continue moving forward and away from the first-frame viewpoint, appearing smaller. Simultaneously, the white car to the left recedes further along the curving road, also moving away from the initial viewpoint. The scene shifts as if the viewer is also moving forward, with the displayed pace changing from 5:10 /km to 5:05 /km and the track from -3% to -2%.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a sunny autumn scene looking forward along a paved pedestrian path. To the immediate left, a grassy verge separates the path from an asphalt road, beyond which a light-colored multi-story building stands against distant dark mountains under a blue sky with scattered white clouds and a bright sun in the upper left. A row of trees with vibrant yellow and green autumn foliage borders the right side of the path, behind which a parking lot filled with various cars is visible, along with a large information sign partially obscured by the closest tree in the right foreground. A person walks away from the viewer further along the path, and a data overlay showing metrics like "Pace" and "Distance" is present in the top right corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the paved path, causing the person walking ahead on the path to recede further into the distance relative to the viewer's position. The row of autumn trees to the viewer's right and the road and building to the viewer's left shift towards the viewer's sides as they are passed. The landscape ahead unfolds, revealing more of the parking lot and distant buildings to the right, and the road continuing into the background on the left, all while the data overlay remains static relative to the screen.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a paved path extending directly forward from the viewer, flanked by a strip of green grass on the left and a row of autumn-foliaged trees on the right. To the left of the grass lies a road, beyond which a light-colored building and mountains rise, while a parking lot with cars is visible to the right, behind the trees, with a person walking away on the path.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the path, the person ahead recedes further into the distance, and the initial autumn trees and parked cars on the right shift backward. Concurrently, new segments of the parking lot and additional distant trees continuously emerge to the far right of the first-frame's right boundary, with the road and building on the left also receding.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a paved path extends directly from the viewer towards the center-left, with a person walking ahead. To the right of the path, a grassy strip leads to a large tree with vibrant yellow and green leaves, which partially obscures a parking lot with several cars, including a red one, further right. On the left, a parallel road is separated by a grassy median, with a light-colored building visible on the far left and distant dark mountains rising in the background. A bright sun is in the upper left, and a digital overlay shows metrics in the upper right.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the paved path, the walking person ahead appears progressively further away. The large yellow-leafed tree on the right shifts out of frame towards the right, fully revealing the parked red car and other vehicles in the parking lot to its right. The building on the far left and the distant bridge also move rightward relative to the frame as the viewpoint advances. The pace indicated in the upper right corner updates from 4:55 /km to 5:00 /km.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a paved path extends from the viewer towards the background, flanked by green grass. To the path's immediate right, a large tree with vibrant green and yellow autumn leaves partially obstructs a parking area with a red car and several darker vehicles. To the path's left, a road runs parallel, with a multi-story white building further left and a distant mountainous landscape in the background under a sunny blue sky. An overlay showing '5:00/km' and '5.8 KM' is in the top-right.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the path. The large autumn tree on the right gradually moves out of the frame to the right, revealing more of the parked cars to the right of the path. Simultaneously, the person walking on the path moves further into the distance, away from the viewer. The white building on the left side of the road also appears to recede slightly as the camera advances.
