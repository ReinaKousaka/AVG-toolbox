The first frame displays a large, multi-story building with numerous wooden balconies and vibrant purple flower boxes dominating the center and left foreground, its ground floor featuring an awning and outdoor seating with a street lamp positioned slightly to the right of center. To the right, another building with similar floral balconies and distant people are visible, with mountains on the far left under a bright sky.

Subsequent frames exhibit a subtle, gradual zoom-out, causing the primary building to slightly recede and revealing marginally more of the adjacent street and buildings to the right from the original viewpoint.

The first frame presents a multi-story, chalet-style building with numerous wooden balconies brimming with vibrant purple flowers, extending upwards and to the right from the viewer's lower left. Below the balconies, at ground level, a white facade houses a visible "Restaurant & Bar" sign, windows, and an outdoor dining area with red chairs and woven partitions positioned centrally and to the viewer's right.

The camera then subtly pulls back, gradually revealing more of the adjacent street scene to the viewer's left and a wider expanse of the sky above, subtly increasing the perceived distance from the initial viewpoint.
