The first frame depicts a snowy, wet alley with a person holding a black umbrella walking away on the left, alongside a gray building wall. To the right, a restaurant facade features a menu board with Korean dishes and a glowing sign, leading to more pedestrians and distant buildings straight ahead.
end of description
Over subsequent frames, the umbrella-holding person continues moving away from the viewer, revealing a light blue scooter parked on the left street-side. Concurrently, the viewer's forward movement causes the right-side menu board to recede partially from view, while more of the red restaurant facade and its golden characters become visible.

The first frame depicts a wet, snow-covered alleyway viewed from street level, flanked by tall grey buildings. A blue scooter with a white cover is parked to the immediate left, while a red vertical sign with gold characters is partially visible on the building to the right. Numerous pedestrians, many with umbrellas, walk away from the viewer into the snowy midground.
end of description
As the viewpoint slowly moves forward, the blue scooter on the left gradually exits the frame, revealing more of the right-side building with its red sign. Pedestrians continue to recede further into the distance as snowflakes persistently fall throughout the evolving scene.

The first frame captures a snowy, narrow urban alley, populated by pedestrians carrying umbrellas. A prominent red signboard with gold Korean script stands to the viewer's immediate right, opposite a modern building on the left, with a restaurant façade further down on the right.
end of description
As frames progress, people continually move along the slushy path; individuals previously in the mid-ground on the left move closer to the viewer and eventually exit the left side of the frame. Simultaneously, new pedestrians emerge from deeper within the alley, walking towards the viewer. The steady snowfall and the general cityscape, including the red signboard and buildings, remain constant.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a snowy urban alleyway, with tall light-colored buildings lining both sides. On the immediate left foreground, several blurry pedestrians with umbrellas, including one in a tan coat, are walking past the viewer, while others are visible further down the alley. A glass storefront with neon signs and menu boards is on the right, alongside a section of wall covered in food posters, and a white sign with Korean text is visible on the distant left building.
end of description.
In subsequent frames, the foreground pedestrians, particularly the person in the tan coat, move past and exit to the left, progressively revealing a snow-covered white scooter and a utility cart located on the mid-left side of the alley. Other umbrella-carrying individuals continue walking down the alley, some passing the viewer and others receding into the distance. Snow persistently falls throughout the sequence, subtly accumulating on the ground and objects.

In the first frame, a snowy street scene unfolds with snow falling. To the immediate left, a white scooter covered in snow rests beside a blue cart and other bundled items. Further left, a gray building wall displays a sign with Korean text "서문회관" (Seomun Hoegwan) and an arrow. In the mid-ground, a group of four people holding umbrellas walk towards the viewer, appearing from deeper within the street. In the background, a white car is visible further down the narrow street, flanked by tall, snow-dusted buildings. To the right of the viewer, an adjacent building features a brightly lit "TERRA" sign, various posters and menus, and two ornate light fixtures, one hanging and one lantern-style. Two black A-frame signs stand in front of this building.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the group of four people with umbrellas moves closer and begins to walk past the viewer towards the left foreground. A fifth person, also holding an umbrella, initially positioned on the right mid-ground, slowly moves towards the viewer. As the first group passes, a red object, possibly a fire extinguisher on a cart, becomes more visible on the far left. Later, a person holding an orange balloon emerges from behind the left-most walker, moving towards the viewer, while the person on the right continues their approach.

The viewer is positioned in a narrow, snow-covered city alleyway. In the immediate foreground, a blurry person with a white umbrella stands to the viewer's left, partially obscuring another figure in an orange jacket. Slightly left of center, a man walks towards the viewer holding a black umbrella, his upper body and face obscured by the umbrella and weather. To the viewer's right, a building facade displays a lit lantern, several Korean menu signs, and a small potted plant. Further down the snowy alley, a silver Hyundai sedan is partially visible, facing away, with an orange, bulbous object behind it to the left. The alley is lined with grey buildings and overhead power lines, under a snowy sky.
end of description
The people in the foreground, including the man with the black umbrella and the figures to the viewer's left, gradually move past the viewer and out of the frame. As they depart, the silver sedan in the midground becomes fully visible, appearing to move slightly closer in subsequent frames. A large orange, bulbous object is revealed on the snowy ground to the left of the sedan. A brown cardboard box also appears on the ground to the viewer's immediate left. The overall view expands to clearly show the snowy alley receding into the distance, with buildings and a distant figure becoming more defined as the foreground clears.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a silver Hyundai Sonata taxi (license plate 31거 5000) is in the left foreground, facing away from the viewer down a snowy street. Behind the taxi on the left, an orange-yellow inflatable decoration with a white cap is partially visible. On the far right, a vertical banner displays various Korean food dishes, behind which a building with a green facade and illuminated signs is present. A narrow, snow-dusted street extends into the distance, with a lone pedestrian walking away in the mid-ground and other pedestrians with umbrellas further back. Tall, grey buildings line the left side of the street, while commercial buildings with illuminated signs are on the right, all under falling snow.

end of description
As the frames progress, the silver taxi, initially in the left foreground, slowly moves past the viewer and out of frame to the left, revealing a fully visible orange-yellow inflatable structure on the left side of the street. The street and buildings on both sides gradually slide towards the left, indicating the viewer is moving forward. The storefronts and food banners on the right become more prominent and detailed as they pass the camera's viewpoint. Pedestrians further down the snowy street continue to walk away from the viewer, maintaining their relative distance. Snow continues to fall consistently across all frames.
