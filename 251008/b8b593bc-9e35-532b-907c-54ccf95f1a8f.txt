In the first frame, a paved, dark grey path curves gently to the right and ascends into the distance from the viewer's immediate foreground. To the left foreground, a wooden trash bin with an open lid rests beside the path, flanked by several tree trunks and dense green ground cover. Overhead, a lush canopy of green leaves from numerous trees covers the left and central portion of the frame, with more foliage lining the path's right edge. Further along the path on the right, a group of three individuals walks away from the viewer, while a lone person in white is visible further up the path.
end of description
The group of three people on the path's right side progressively moves further away from the viewer, receding into the distance. Simultaneously, the lone person in white also continues walking away, moving further up the path and eventually disappearing from view beyond the trees on the right. The trash bin, trees, and path remain stationary throughout.

A paved path curves gently uphill from the viewer's foreground, bordered on the left by dense green ground cover and large trees forming an overhead canopy, with lush foliage also lining the right side. A person in a white shirt and dark pants walks away from the viewer in the mid-distance along this path, and a dark lamppost stands beside the path on the left.
end of description
The person in the white shirt continues walking further away along the path, moving from the mid-right towards the distant center-left relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Subsequently, a second person briefly appears much further down the path to the left of the first person, also walking away into the background before exiting the visible area.
