A dirt path extends from the viewer into the midground, flanked by reddish-brown vegetation. To the left, a dense line of evergreen trees stands with the sun shining brightly through them, while more scattered trees and a gentle slope occupy the right side. Above, a clear blue sky with sparse white clouds completes the scene.
