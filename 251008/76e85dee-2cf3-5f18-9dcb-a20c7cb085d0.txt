The first frame depicts a wet, rainy city street at night with illuminated buildings and various shop signs. A scooter is parked in the foreground on wet pavement marked with black bollards and yellow lines, while multiple people with dark umbrellas occupy the midground sidewalk and street, with one individual in a light coat and umbrella walking left-to-right across a crosswalk to the far left. end of description. Subsequently, the person in the light coat continues walking rightward across the crosswalk. Simultaneously, the group of people with dark umbrellas in the mid-right begins moving leftward across the street from their initial standing positions.

The first frame captures a rainy city street at night, with a silver and black scooter parked on the wet pavement in the foreground, slightly left of center. To the left, a multi-story building is covered in brightly lit Korean signs, including a pedestrian crossing sign, while a narrow, green median strip with benches runs through the mid-ground. Several people carrying black and light green umbrellas walk away from the viewer along the left sidewalk. On the right, a building facade features illuminated store signs, round decorative lights, and a prominent red and white advertising board. In the distance, taller buildings are visible under a dark sky.

As the frames progress, the people with umbrellas continue walking away from the viewer on the left sidewalk, receding into the distance. From frame 6 onwards, a transparent umbrella with visible raindrops gradually descends into the top portion of the frame, indicating the viewer is now looking from beneath an umbrella, positioned directly above the original viewpoint. The parked scooter and the surrounding buildings remain stationary.

We observe a rainy city street at night from beneath a clear umbrella adorned with raindrops. To the viewer's right, a wet sidewalk runs alongside storefronts illuminated by circular and rectangular signs, with a large promotional signboard positioned prominently near the foreground. To the left, a wet road reflects colorful city lights, separated from the sidewalk by a planter featuring green foliage and benches, while numerous buildings line the street into the dark background.
end of description
Over the following frames, pedestrians previously visible in the mid-distance move further down the sidewalk ahead of the viewer. The promotional signboard on the right foreground subtly shifts slightly rightward, briefly revealing a blue vertical sign, then moves back. Meanwhile, the reflections on the wet ground shimmer and raindrops on the umbrella surface exhibit minor shifts.

The first frame shows a rainy night in a city, viewed from beneath a clear, rain-spotted umbrella that occupies the upper half of the image. To the left, a wet street runs alongside a pedestrian path lined with green bushes and dark benches. In the midground, several pedestrians holding umbrellas walk away from the viewer on the glistening wet pavement. To the right, a row of brightly lit storefronts, one displaying a circular blue sign and another a 'Send' advertisement, illuminates the sidewalk. Tall buildings with glowing windows dominate the background, fading into the night sky.
end of description
From the first-frame viewpoint, the camera subtly moves forward and slightly to the right. The pedestrians continue to walk further away into the distance. A new yellow and black striped sign on the far right, initially partially hidden by the frame edge, becomes increasingly revealed as the camera progresses. The reflective quality of the wet ground and storefront lights shifts slightly with the subtle movement.

The first frame captures a rainy city night from a first-person perspective under a clear umbrella, revealing raindrops on its surface across the top. Below, a wet sidewalk extends into the midground on the right, flanked by brightly lit storefronts and featuring two individuals walking away under umbrellas. To the left, a wet street with car lights and a planted median with benches stretches into the background, beneath distant city buildings with numerous illuminated signs.
end of description
As the frames progress, the two individuals with umbrellas consistently walk further away from the viewer down the sidewalk, becoming smaller and more distant. Subtle dynamic changes include shifting reflections on the wet pavement and minor fluctuations in the intensity of various artificial lights in the background.

The viewer is positioned under a clear, rain-spattered umbrella, looking forward down a wet city street at night. To the left, a tree-lined median with benches separates the sidewalk from a street where multiple cars with illuminated headlights are visible further down. To the right, a brightly lit commercial sidewalk features several storefronts with glowing signs and multiple pedestrians carrying umbrellas, walking away from the viewer. In the distance, numerous city buildings display various illuminated signs, including a red "NETFLIX" sign, all under a dark, rainy sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective subtly advances forward along the wet sidewalk. Pedestrians on both sides of the street, shielded by umbrellas, continue walking away into the distance, with a person on the right moving most prominently. Concurrently, vehicles on the wet street on the left also proceed further down the road, their headlights reflecting on the soaked pavement. Raindrops on the clear umbrella above the viewer constantly shift and trickle, emphasizing the continuous rainfall.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a rainy night city scene from under a clear, rain-splashed umbrella that arches over the top and right foreground. A wet street with moving vehicles and a green median lies to the viewer's left, while a bustling sidewalk with umbrella-carrying pedestrians and illuminated storefronts extends to the viewer's right, all leading towards distant city lights and buildings straight ahead.
end of description
Subsequently, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk, causing objects initially further ahead to move closer to the first-frame viewpoint's position. Pedestrians on the right side of the first-frame viewpoint move from being ahead to alongside, and eventually behind the camera's original position, while vehicles on the street continue moving away on the left.
