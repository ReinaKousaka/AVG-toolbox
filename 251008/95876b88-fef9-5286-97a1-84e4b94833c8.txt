The first frame shows a wet, paved pathway extending into the distance from the viewer's immediate foreground. To the left, a black metal fence runs alongside the path, bordered by green bushes and tall trees, with a light-colored utility box visible in the left foreground next to the fence. To the right, a curb separates the path from a strip of green bushes and a line of trees, behind which a wet road is visible in the mid-ground, extending towards the background where a blue circular pedestrian/bicycle sign is mounted on a pole.
end of description
Rain visibly falls across the entire scene, causing ripples on the wet ground, while the foliage of trees on the right, particularly the front-most one, begins to sway strongly from side to side due to increasing wind. As the video progresses, a large vehicle, appearing to be a truck, travels from right to left in the mid-distance on the wet road, partially obscured by the trees on the right. The wind continues to affect the trees, with their leaves fluttering more vigorously throughout the remaining frames.
