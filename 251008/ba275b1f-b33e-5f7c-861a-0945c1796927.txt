The first frame shows a narrow, leaf-strewn dirt path winding forward into a verdant woodland, flanked by a steep, ivy-covered bank to the left and trees with bright green foliage to the right, with a glimpse of a paved road further right. end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the dirt path, causing the immediate foliage on both sides to recede towards the background. As the viewer progresses deeper into the woodland, previously obscured sections of the path and surrounding dense green undergrowth ahead become visible. The paved road to the far right gradually moves out of the frame as the path continues to curve slightly to the left.
