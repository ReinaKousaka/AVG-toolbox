In the first frame, a paved road with white dashed lines extends into the midground, curving slightly right. A concrete barrier and green hedges run along the left, separating the road from a sidewalk and a large green tree. To the right, a dark blue car is parked on a paved area, beside a partially visible brown-roofed building. In the midground, beyond the curve, are several buildings including a prominent light-colored house and a multi-story structure. Majestic green mountains with rocky peaks dominate the background under a clear blue sky.

As the viewer moves forward along the road, the initial large green tree on the left recedes. A white van parked behind the dark blue car on the right becomes fully visible, and more of the brown-roofed building to its right is revealed. A street light on the left side of the road and a section of green hillside with what appears to be solar panels further to the left become more prominent relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

In the first frame, a paved road with white dashed lines extends forward, curving slightly right from the viewer's perspective. To the left, a sidewalk runs alongside a low concrete wall, behind which are green bushes, a tall light pole, and two housesâ€”a white one with a brown roof and a lighter beige multi-story building with balconies. On the far right, a partial view of a dark brown building with red accents is visible, in front of which a white van with a roof box is parked. In the background, lush green, tree-covered mountains rise steeply, topped by rugged gray and green rocky peaks against a clear blue sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The light pole, concrete wall, and the initial houses on the left, along with the white van and dark building on the right, gradually recede *to the sides and behind* the first-frame viewpoint. Further sections of the road and additional buildings *ahead* of the initial position become visible. A dark red car also appears *in the distance on the road*, slowly approaching the first-frame viewpoint.
