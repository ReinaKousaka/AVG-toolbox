The first frame shows a wet, rainy intersection from a ground-level perspective. In the immediate foreground, a red bicycle lane with white dashed lines is on the right, parallel to a black and white striped crosswalk on the left. The midground features a multi-lane wet road, with a dark sedan and several white cars queuing in the left lanes, while other vehicles are positioned further into the intersection. To the far left, a bus stop shelter with people stands beside a street, leading to distant buildings and a bus. On the right, a sidewalk with people holding umbrellas, streetlights, multiple traffic signals showing green for straight and left turns, and a large informational sign are visible against a backdrop of trees and more distant structures under an overcast sky.

The dark sedan prominently featured in the midground of the first frame progresses across the intersection, moving from the center-left towards the right side of the view. Simultaneously, the line of cars on the left advances forward, further into the distance. As the sedan moves out of the primary view towards the right, a dark SUV appears from the far right of the frame, entering the intersection and continuing its movement to the left.

The first frame presents a rainy city intersection with a wet zebra crossing and a red bicycle lane in the foreground. Vehicles are queued on the left, led by a white taxi, while a dark SUV and another black car move from the right-midground across the intersection, with buildings and traffic signals in the background.
end of description
The dark SUV and the white taxi begin moving forward through the intersection. A new white sedan then appears from the far right, turning left into the intersection, as the preceding black car exits to the far left. Subsequently, another white taxi from the left midground moves towards the viewer while the dark SUV exits, and a motorcyclist emerges from the far right, also moving left.

The first frame displays a wet, multi-lane road under an overcast, rainy sky. In the foreground, a red bike lane marked with white dashed lines is on the left, next to a white pedestrian crosswalk. A white sedan occupies the center-right lane, moving away from the viewer, with a black SUV slightly behind it to its right, and a white compact car further back in the adjacent left lane. In the background, buildings and trees line both sides of the road, featuring traffic lights, a 'U-turn' sign, and a '60' speed limit sign on the right, and a bus and bus stop on the far left. A motorcyclist in a yellow vest is visible on the far right, near an intersection.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the white sedan moves forward and exits to the right of the viewer's initial perspective, followed by the black SUV which also moves right and out of view. Concurrently, the white compact car advances towards the viewer's mid-left, with a black sedan proceeding behind it. The motorcyclist, initially on the far right, crosses the intersection, moving towards the viewer's left. All vehicles continue their movement generally away from the viewer or across the scene from right to left, with visible rain and road reflections persisting.
