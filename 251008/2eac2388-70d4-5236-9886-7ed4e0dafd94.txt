The first frame captures a nighttime city street scene from a pedestrian's vantage point. To the viewer's immediate left, a building facade displays a lit menu with food images. A sidewalk extends ahead with several pedestrians walking away, while others approach from the right, alongside a street with vehicles and buildings adorned with illuminated signs.

As the frames advance, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk; the food menu on the left gradually exits the frame, revealing a metal roller shutter on the same building. A cartoon drawing of two people progressively becomes visible on this shutter as the viewer continues to move ahead. Pedestrians on both sides of the viewer also continue their movement.

The first frame captures an evening street scene from a ground-level perspective on a city sidewalk. To the immediate left, a building with corrugated metal shutters is visible, featuring a large, colorful cartoon drawing of two figures and Japanese text. On the right, a man in a white t-shirt, holding a phone, is in the foreground walking towards the viewer, while a cluster of other pedestrians walks further ahead and away from the viewer on the same sidewalk. Beyond the sidewalk, a busy street extends into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings with numerous illuminated signs under a dark blue twilight sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk, causing the man in the white t-shirt to exit the frame to the immediate right. The group of pedestrians walking away from the viewer continues to move further into the midground. Simultaneously, the cartoon-covered shutters on the left slide out of view, revealing more of the building's facade and a brightly lit interior further down the street. New pedestrians emerge from the right side, walking past the viewer and continuing down the sidewalk.

In the first frame, a city street scene at dusk or night is depicted. To the immediate left, a large portion of a building wall with white, horizontal roller shutters is prominent. A narrow sidewalk extends into the midground on the left, populated by several pedestrians walking away from the viewer. To the right of the sidewalk, a street stretches into the distance, lined with multi-story buildings adorned with numerous brightly lit signs in Japanese, including some with orange hues. In the midground right, a pole with a red-framed informational sign partially obscures a person walking towards the viewer. The sky is dark blue, and artificial lights illuminate the urban landscape.

The camera moves forward along the sidewalk, causing the roller-shuttered wall on the left to recede, revealing an orange-framed storefront with a glass display and "Ticket" signage in the mid-left. The red-framed sign and pole that were on the far right move out of view. Pedestrians continue their movement, with new individuals appearing from the far right walking towards the viewer. Further down the street, on the left, a "Money Exchange" sign with dollar bill imagery becomes fully visible above the storefronts.

First frame shows a bustling city street at night, with a brightly lit "Ticket Oz" shop on the left featuring an orange awning and display cases, and a building adorned with a money-themed mural above it. Numerous pedestrians traverse the sidewalk, with a woman and man walking towards the viewer on the right foreground, while others move away into the distant, neon-lit street.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the foreground couple steadily approaches and passes the viewer to their left, while more pedestrians emerge from behind the viewer on the right, also moving forward. Concurrently, a person appears inside the "Ticket Oz" shop behind the counter, and another individual walks to the shop's entrance on the far left.
