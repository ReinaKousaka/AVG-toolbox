The first frame displays a narrow urban street extending away from the viewer under an overcast sky. To the viewer's immediate left stands a tall, light-gray utility pole, behind which is a two-story dark red building with a white lower facade and dark doors. A black bicycle with a front basket is parked on the sidewalk in front of this building. To the viewer's immediate right, another light-gray utility pole partially obscures a two-story white building. In the midground, the street features white Japanese characters, and several orange and white traffic barriers are visible on the left side. Two figures are seen walking away into the distance, where taller buildings of varying colors line the street.

The camera progressively moves forward along the street. Objects initially in the midground, such as the black bicycle on the left and the surrounding buildings, appear closer and larger relative to the original viewpoint. The two figures walking away in the distance also become more distinct as the camera advances towards their initial position. As the camera moves further, a yellow sign on the door of the red building on the left becomes clearly visible, revealing more details previously obscure to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a narrow urban street leading away from the viewer, flanked by multi-story buildings. On the left, a red building with a dark door and an upper-level window stands behind a parked bicycle with a basket in the foreground. Opposite, a white and grey building with a black gate is on the right. Further down the street, a construction area with green netting and orange cones is visible on the left, while two individuals in blue uniforms stand in the midground on the right. Overhead, numerous utility wires crisscross against an overcast sky, with taller buildings visible in the distant background.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the street, causing the surrounding buildings and features to appear closer and larger. The two individuals in blue uniforms on the right gradually recede further down the street from the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the construction area on the left progresses into the foreground, becoming more prominent. By the final frames, a third person in a yellow uniform is revealed further ahead in the street, beyond the initial position of the blue-uniformed individuals.
