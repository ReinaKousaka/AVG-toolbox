First frame shows a multi-story building with shops and balconies on the viewer's left, alongside a paved road where a black car is driving away. To the viewer's right, a low stone wall borders a grassy area with trees and a wooden information sign, while further down the curving road are more buildings, leading to a prominent snow-capped mountain range under a blue, cloudy sky in the background.

The black car on the left side of the road progressively moves forward and exits the frame to the left of the viewer. Simultaneously, the camera subtly pans right, revealing more of the multi-story building and additional parked vehicles, including a white van, further down and to the right of the wooden sign structure. Pedestrians on the sidewalk to the left continue to move past the shops.

The scene shows a paved road leading into a mountain village, with traditional buildings, shops, and pedestrians on the left, and a stone wall bordering a grassy area with a wooden information board and a modern building on the right, all beneath towering snow-capped mountains.
end of description
As the viewer progresses forward, the stone wall and grassy area extend further into view on the right. The information board initially on the mid-right moves closer to the viewer and then begins to leave the frame's right edge, revealing a blue pole behind it. Simultaneously, a large evergreen tree and the multi-story building on the far right become increasingly prominent, while pedestrians continue moving along the left sidewalk towards the background.

The first frame shows a scenic town street with majestic snow-capped mountains in the background, under a partly cloudy blue sky. To the left, traditional-style buildings line a sidewalk where pedestrians walk, and a "bikebox" flag is visible. The asphalt road curves slightly right towards the middle ground where a large brown-roofed building stands. On the right, a low stone wall borders a patch of grass, behind which a multi-story building and a tall pole are visible.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly moves forward along the road. On the left, several pedestrians continue moving further away, and a person on a bicycle travels from the left side of the road across the frame to the right, eventually exiting. Simultaneously, a distinctive blue, bent hydrant-like object becomes fully visible on the right next to the tall pole, gradually moving further right and slightly closer, indicating the camera's forward motion. A red car also appears in the distance on the left side of the road, approaches the viewer, and eventually comes to a stop near the brown-roofed building in the center.
