The first frame depicts a wet street scene on a rainy day, with a prominent white zebra crossing in the foreground extending from the lower right. To the left, an intersection features dashed white lines and four vehicles (a white sedan, a light green van, another white sedan, and a dark SUV) positioned further down the road. On the right, a sidewalk runs parallel to the viewer, where a red traffic light, a yellow speed limit sign, a red pillar, and a person holding an umbrella walking away from the viewer are visible. Lush green trees line both sides of the street in the background.

In the subsequent frames, the person with the umbrella on the right sidewalk steadily moves further away from the viewer, progressing down the street to the right. The vehicles on the left side of the intersection remain stationary. Subtle shifting reflections on the wet road surface indicate the ongoing rainfall.

The first frame displays a rainy street scene from a slightly elevated viewpoint. In the immediate foreground, a wet asphalt road features white crosswalk stripes extending from the bottom right towards the middle-left, alongside dashed white road markings on the left. To the mid-left, several vehicles are parked or stationary on a wet street, including a light gray van and a white sedan, bordered by trees. On the mid-right, a sidewalk with a red traffic light pole showing a red signal, a red mailbox, and lush green trees is visible, with a person holding an umbrella walking away from the viewer. Further to the right, concrete stairs ascend, leading to buildings in the background, while rain visibly falls across the entire scene.

Subsequently, the person with the umbrella on the mid-right sidewalk continues walking away from the viewer, gradually moving further down the street. The heavy rain persists, creating ripples on the wet road surface.
