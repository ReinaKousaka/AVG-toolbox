frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a train track receding into the distance, curving slightly to the left, with a steep, moss-covered rock face immediately to the viewer's left. To the viewer's right, a smaller rock outcrop with an electrified utility pole and a fence is present, beyond which a forested valley partially obscured by mist is visible under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the initial rock outcrop, utility pole, and fence on the right recede and move out of view to the right, revealing a wider expanse of the mist-shrouded, pine-forested valley ahead and to the right. Concurrently, the steep rock face on the left passes by, and a low concrete or gravel pathway becomes increasingly visible alongside the tracks on the right.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows train tracks curving to the left, occupying the center of the view and receding into the distance. To the immediate left, a tall, dark rocky cliff face rises close to the viewer. On the right, a rocky embankment slopes away from the tracks, dotted with green and yellowish trees. A utility pole with overhead wires is visible in the mid-right, extending across the frame above the tracks. In the background, rolling, tree-covered mountains are partially obscured by mist under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks. The rocky cliff on the left passes by, revealing a section where the natural rock transitions into a constructed stone retaining wall further along the curve. Concurrently, the utility pole on the right moves out of the foreground, and a signal post with two lights emerges further down the track on the left side. The landscape on both sides continuously unfolds as the viewer advances towards the misty mountains in the distance.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a train track receding into the distance, curving left, with a rocky embankment and a steep, forested hillside immediately to the left, and a forested slope to the right. An overhead catenary system stretches above the tracks, supported by a utility pole to the right, while a signal pole stands left of the track in the mid-ground, all beneath an overcast sky and distant misty mountains to the right.
end of description
As the train moves forward, the track continuously unrolls ahead, with the rocky and forested slopes passing by on either side relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Both the signal pole, initially left of the track, and the utility pole, initially to the right, gradually approach the viewer and eventually pass to their respective sides, as new sections of the curving track and the distant landscape are progressively revealed further ahead.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a view looking straight down train tracks that curve gently to the left in the distance. To the immediate left, a steep, green and autumn-colored hillside rises, featuring a black and yellow signal pole with traffic lights and a white box below it. To the right, a denser forest of dark green coniferous trees lines a less steep embankment, with a concrete barrier running alongside the tracks in the mid-ground, and misty distant mountains visible further right. An overcast sky dominates the top, with overhead wires extending across the frame.
end of description
The viewpoint advances steadily along the tracks, causing the initial signal pole and white box on the left to move past the viewer, revealing more of the forested hillside beyond. Subsequently, a red and white striped pole appears on the left side of the tracks, approaching the viewer from the distance before eventually passing. The tracks continue to curve to the left, with the entire landscape of hills and dense trees appearing to move from ahead, to the sides, and then behind the viewer as the train progresses.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a train track stretching directly forward into the distance, where it curves gently to the right. To the viewer's left, a steep hillside rises, composed of exposed gray rock faces and covered with green and reddish-brown vegetation, interspersed with utility poles and overhead wires. To the right, a dense evergreen forest lines a less steep slope, with a concrete barrier running alongside the tracks, all beneath an overcast sky.
end of description
The viewpoint moves steadily forward along the tracks. The rocky hillside on the left and the forested slope on the right progressively recede towards the sides and behind the initial viewpoint. A small wooden platform briefly appears on the lower left near the tracks and passes out of view. As the journey continues, a dark tunnel entrance becomes increasingly visible in the distance, positioned ahead and slightly to the right of the first-frame's center of view.
