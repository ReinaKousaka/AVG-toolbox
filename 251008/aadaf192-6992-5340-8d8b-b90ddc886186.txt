The first frame presents a narrow village alley framed by two close stone buildings, revealing a distant waterfall cascading down a forested mountain through the opening. On the left, a partial stone wall features a dark doorway with a green object inside; on the right, another stone wall with a fan-like decoration flanks a stone path leading forward towards another stone house and a small tree in the midground.
end of description.
The viewpoint then advances forward and slightly to the right, widening the vista as the foreground buildings recede. This movement progressively reveals more of the stone path and a new window opening on the right building, making the distant waterfall and mountains appear somewhat closer.
