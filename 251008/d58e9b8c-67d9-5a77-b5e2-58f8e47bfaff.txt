A paved path extends into a mountain valley, flanked by stone pillars topped with metal sculptures in the foreground. To the left, a wooden building with a "Bergbahnen Adelboden" sign is partially obscured by another building displaying "Alpen Chic"; to the right, a hedge borders part of a similar wooden structure. Majestic green mountains, some snow-capped, rise in the background under a blue sky, framing a large tree in the midground.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the "Alpen Chic" sign on the left pivots outwards like a gate, progressively revealing more of the building structure directly behind it, closer to the viewer's left, as it swings open.
