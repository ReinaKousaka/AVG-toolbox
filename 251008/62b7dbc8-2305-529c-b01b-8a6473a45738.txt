In the first frame, a dry, light-colored ground covered with numerous short, brown, dead plant stems occupies the bottom half. To the right, a stone retaining wall extends from the edge, above which sits a light-colored house with a window. To the left of the stone wall, a darker concrete retaining wall rises, with two small, dilapidated buildings featuring corrugated roofs and a satellite dish partially visible behind it to the left. A set of steps with a metal railing ascends the concrete wall section, and a dense, tree-covered hillside forms the background across the top left and center, beneath a clear blue sky.

The camera smoothly pans to the left. The house on the upper right and a significant portion of the stone wall progressively move out of view to the right. Simultaneously, more of the concrete retaining wall and the distant hillside to the left become visible, revealing additional buildings and an urban settlement beyond the original far-left viewpoint, moving towards the frame's center.
