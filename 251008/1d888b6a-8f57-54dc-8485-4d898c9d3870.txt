The first frame depicts a street scene under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's immediate right is a light-colored brick wall with a dark base and railings, extending into the distance, with a utility pole on the far right foreground. To the left is an asphalt road, separated by a green guardrail, leading towards multiple cars and a construction site with white hoardings and orange machinery further down. In the background, prominent high-rise buildings, including a large white one and a taller dark one, are visible.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the sidewalk. The utility pole on the far right exits the frame, and the brick wall on the right gradually recedes as the viewer progresses. Simultaneously, the construction site on the left appears closer, revealing additional orange machinery and white debris behind the hoardings. A pedestrian walking ahead on the sidewalk maintains their position relative to the moving viewpoint, getting closer to the background buildings. A silver car previously in the midground on the left also progresses further down the road.

The first frame displays a street scene with a dark asphalt road to the left, bordered by a green metal railing in the foreground and white construction barriers with cranes beyond. To the right, a long white-tiled wall with a metal fence extends alongside a sidewalk, where a pedestrian walks away from the viewer. In the background, tall buildings, including a prominent white one and a distant reddish structure, stand against a clear blue sky, with a silver car visible on the road ahead.
end of description
As the frames progress, the silver car on the road and the pedestrian on the sidewalk both steadily move forward, further away from the viewer's initial viewpoint. The car gradually overtakes the pedestrian as they continue to recede into the distance.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a street scene where a white tiled wall with a dark top and decorative metal fence runs along the entire right side, while a dark sidewalk occupies the center, separated from the road by a green railing on the left. On the road, a silver Mercedes-Benz car is visible on the left, and a person in a light coat walks on the sidewalk towards the viewer; in the background, tall buildings rise against a clear blue sky.
end of description
In the following frames, the silver Mercedes-Benz car moves from left to right, passing the viewer's initial position and exiting the frame. Concurrently, the person on the sidewalk continues walking closer to and then past the original first-frame viewpoint, as a white van further down the road also gradually approaches.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a white tiled wall with a dark coping and metal fence runs along the right side, extending from the foreground into the background. To the left, a street with a green metal barrier stretches forward, where a person in a light coat and mask walks away from the viewer in the foreground, and a white van is stopped in the mid-ground. Tall buildings, one white and one dark brown, rise in the background to the left of the street under a clear blue sky, with power lines and trees also visible.
end of description
The person on the left continues walking away from the viewer and eventually moves out of the frame entirely. Simultaneously, the white van on the street begins to move forward, also receding further away from the viewer. No new objects or scenes are revealed from behind the viewer, to the left, or inside any container.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
From a sidewalk viewpoint, a light-colored brick wall topped with a decorative metal fence extends along the right side, while a road with green guardrails and a utility pole on the far left stretches into the distance. A white van is present on the road in the midground, with white construction barriers beyond it, and several tall buildings, including a large white skyscraper and a reddish structure, define the background under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The white van dynamically proceeds forward on the road, moving from the midground towards the foreground and passing to the left of the viewer. It continues to move further out of the frame on the viewer's far left, while the surrounding urban street scene remains unchanged relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a street with a white van partially in the foreground left, a road with green guardrails extending forward, and a light brick wall with an ornate metal fence running along the right side. In the mid-ground, a utility pole and white construction barriers line the left, leading to distant high-rise buildings and a clear blue sky.
end of description
As frames progress, the white van moves out of view to the far left, revealing more of the empty road and construction barriers previously obscured in the immediate foreground left of the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a sunlit street scene. On the right, a beige brick wall topped with a dark coping and decorative metal railing extends into the mid-ground, alongside a sidewalk and a light pole displaying multiple signs. To the left, an asphalt road bordered by green metal railings runs parallel to a long white construction barrier. Beyond the barrier, various buildings and structures are visible, culminating in a large white high-rise building on the far left background, accompanied by darker buildings further right, all under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The camera slowly pans to the left, causing the entire scene to shift rightward relative to the initial first-frame viewpoint. The brick wall and light pole on the first frame's right side progressively move further to the right, ultimately exiting the frame's right boundary. Simultaneously, features like the white construction barrier and the buildings beyond it, initially on the left, also shift rightward, revealing new details. A green "Stik" logo on the construction barrier gradually becomes visible, entering the frame from the left of the first-frame's initial view and moving right.
