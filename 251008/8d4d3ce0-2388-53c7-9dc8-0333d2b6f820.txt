The first frame captures a rainy street scene with a paved road sloping downwards in the center foreground, bordered by a gray stone wall and green foliage on the left, where a green scooter handle is visible. To the right, a curb with red and white striped tape leads to a light-colored ground and a low white fence. Dominating the midground is a traditional Korean-style wooden building with a dark tiled roof and balconies, featuring a 'CAFE' sign, situated behind a white retaining wall with decorative planters. To its right stands a cream-colored apartment building, with other residential structures and trees visible under an overcast sky in the background.

Over the subsequent frames, a green electric scooter, initially partly obscured by foliage on the left of the viewer, begins to slowly move down the wet street. It gradually rolls further left and downwards, progressively revealing its full body and wheels as it descends. The scooter continues its movement until it largely exits the bottom-left corner of the frame.

The first frame displays a wet asphalt road sloping from the viewer's left foreground down to the right, adjacent to a white, slatted structure with a dark fence behind it on the right. To the left and further back, a traditional wooden building with a tiled roof, featuring a 'CAFE' sign, is visible, bordered by a stone wall on its immediate left and various plants in front.

Beginning around the fourth frame, a small, dark, hunched figure gradually appears and solidifies on top of the white structure, to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, situated next to an air conditioning unit. Subsequently, the scene subtly widens, revealing more of the distant background to the right of the traditional wooden building, showing additional structures and trees.

The first frame presents a wet asphalt road curving from the lower left towards the mid-right, leading up to a two-story traditional wooden Korean building with a tiled roof, visible centrally, and a "CAFE" sign on its lower facade. To the left of the road is a high grey stone wall, while to the far right, a lighter-colored building with an air conditioning unit and a small statue of a seated figure on its roof is partially seen, all set against a backdrop of trees and distant buildings under an overcast sky.

From the static first-frame viewpoint, subsequent frames show the rain intensifying, with water visibly accumulating on the asphalt road and surrounding surfaces. The primary dynamic change is the increasing visual evidence of continuous rainfall, as no new objects or scenes are revealed.
