A cobblestone street stretches into the distance, with a silver Toyota Prius positioned closest on the right, partially obscuring a dark hatchback and other parked cars along a white building with dark windows and balconies. To the left, a large white building features two prominent garage doors, and a person is visible walking away from the viewer further down this left side. The street narrows between the buildings under an overcast sky.
end of description
The silver car on the immediate right slowly moves forward and eventually out of the frame, revealing more of the dark hatchback that was behind it, which also subtly shifts forward. Concurrently, the white van positioned further down the right side of the street gradually moves forward, as does the person walking away from the viewer on the left side of the street. The overall perspective slightly shifts as if the camera is slowly moving forward.

The first frame displays a cobbled street extending away from the viewer, flanked by buildings under an overcast sky. To the immediate left is a tall, light grey building featuring a large, white segmented garage door and a visible intercom near the bottom left edge. On the right, a white van is parked facing away from the viewer, followed by a row of other parked cars and older cream-colored buildings with dark windows and balconies extending into the distance. Two figures are seen walking away from the viewer, on the left side of the street between the prominent left building and the parked cars.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the two figures on the left side of the street progressively walk further away from the viewer, moving deeper into the scene along the cobbled road. They continue to recede into the distance until they are almost out of frame on the far left, demonstrating continuous movement away from the initial viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a narrow cobblestone street flanked by a large white garage door on the immediate left and a row of older white-and-blue-toned buildings with parked cars on the right, all beneath an overcast sky. Two men wearing masks walk towards the viewer in the mid-ground, positioned slightly left of the street's center. end of description.
In subsequent frames, the two men continue walking past the first-frame viewpoint, moving from the mid-ground left into the immediate foreground left and eventually exiting the frame to the left. As they progress, the large white door and the adjacent building's lower fa√ßade on the left become more prominent, revealing details previously obscured by the men's positions.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a narrow cobblestone street extending into the distance under a cloudy sky. To the immediate left is a white building wall with a dark drainpipe, leading to large green industrial doors further along the building. On the right, a row of parked cars (black, silver, dark grey, light grey, black) lines the curb, behind which stands a multi-story white building with dark windows and a street lamp. In the far distance, the street curves slightly to the left, revealing more buildings with varied architectural styles and colors.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the street. The white wall and green doors on the left, and the parked cars and buildings on the right, progressively shift out of the frame as the perspective advances into the scene. A small red circular sign becomes more prominent on the green doors to the left. A person emerges from behind the parked cars on the right, walking further down the street away from the viewer. More of the distant street and buildings are revealed as the camera continues its forward motion.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a narrow cobblestone street flanked by buildings. To the viewer's immediate left, a large, dark green metal gate covers the entire side of a building, featuring a red no-parking sign. On the right side of the street, several cars are parked, including a silver hatchback, a dark hatchback, and a light-colored hatchback in the foreground, leading up to an older building with multiple windows and a blue vertical banner. Further down the street, a dark gray car is parked on the left, facing away from the viewer. In the distant background, more buildings ascend a hill, with a white construction crane visible above them.
end of description
Throughout the frames, the red no-parking sign on the large green gate on the left slightly shifts upwards and to the left relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The dark gray car parked further down the street on the left has its rear passenger door opened. A person is then seen either entering or exiting this car.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a narrow cobblestone street, with a large dark green gate dominating the left side, next to a white building featuring barred windows. On the right, older buildings line the street, one displaying a prominent blue banner, while a dark grey car with an open trunk is parked mid-ground and the rear of another car is visible in the right foreground. end of description
As the frames progress, a red and blue 'no parking' sign gradually emerges on the left, moving from behind the white building to position itself in front of its second-story window. Concurrently, one of the two figures initially standing near the building entrance on the right moves further inside, and in the final frame, the dark grey car's rear trunk appears to close.
