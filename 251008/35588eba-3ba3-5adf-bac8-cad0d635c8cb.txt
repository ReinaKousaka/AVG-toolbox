The first frame depicts a rainy urban street and sidewalk with a pedestrian carrying an umbrella walking away in the mid-distance. To the viewer's immediate left are two blue recycling bins beside a black railing and wet road, while to the right, two silver bollards precede a row of shop windows and green planters.
end of description.
As the camera tracks forward along the sidewalk, the blue bins and initially foreground bollards recede, eventually moving behind and to the left/right of the original viewpoint, while the distant street, buildings, and the walking pedestrian, originally further ahead, gradually shift closer towards the original viewpoint's position.
