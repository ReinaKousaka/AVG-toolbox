The first frame captures a lush, green valley with steep, densely forested hillsides surrounding a prominent waterfall cascading down a cliff in the lower-center. Further up and behind it, a rocky streambed leads to a higher section of falling water visible in the upper-right background.

The viewpoint then gradually pulls back and ascends, expanding the scene to reveal more of the deep valley's towering walls to the left and right. The lower waterfall recedes towards the bottom of the frame, while the higher waterfall becomes more central and prominent, displaying a longer cascade and more of the rocky terrain leading to it, deeper into the background from the initial perspective.
