The first frame captures a vibrant red building with an external red staircase leading to a second-floor balcony, and a ground-level entrance in the background. A paved courtyard occupies the midground and foreground, featuring several individuals walking; a woman in a white top and pink pants walks left, while two women are prominent in the immediate foreground looking towards the viewer, with other people visible further back to the right. A light-colored tree trunk is on the far left, and green foliage frames the upper left and right.

The camera slowly pans to the left, revealing more of the tree trunk and an adjacent stone wall on the far left, while the far right portion of the red building gradually moves out of view. Individuals in the foreground and midground dynamically shift: the woman in white and pink pants continues moving left and eventually exits the frame, while the two foreground women also move out of frame to the right. A man wearing a dark jacket and mask emerges from behind the tree on the far left, walking towards the staircase, as a new woman enters the frame from the bottom right.

In the first frame, a large red traditional-style building with a red staircase and pillars dominates the mid-ground right. To its left, a group of three people stands near the staircase base: a man in a dark jacket and mask faces slightly right, flanked by two women behind him. A prominent tree trunk with white bark is on the far left foreground, with green foliage below it. In the background left, beyond the tree, is another traditional building with a gray roof. A woman in a black coat is partially visible at the far right foreground.

The man in the dark jacket, initially in the mid-ground left of the red building, turns and begins walking towards the viewer's left, while the woman behind him starts photographing the red building with her phone. Subsequently, a new man, wearing a blue jacket and pushing a black stroller, enters from the far left, behind the prominent tree, moving towards the mid-ground right. The man in the dark jacket continues his movement towards the viewer's left, eventually nearing the frame's edge. Concurrently, the woman at the far right of the initial frame gradually moves further out of sight towards the right.
