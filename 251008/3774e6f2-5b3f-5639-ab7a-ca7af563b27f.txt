First frame: A man in a brown jacket and glasses is partially visible in the foreground right, walking left on a city sidewalk. The mid-ground features a street with yellow taxis and cars on the left, and a bustling sidewalk with pedestrians walking away from the viewer. Tall city buildings and storefronts like 'Intimissimi' and 'ALDO' line the right side and background.
end of description
The man in the brown jacket exits the frame to the left, as a woman in a dark jacket emerges fully from the far right and walks towards the 'Intimissimi' store entrance, further away from the viewer. Pedestrians and vehicles in the mid-ground continue moving down the street, away from the initial viewpoint.

The first frame shows a city street scene. In the foreground, a concrete sidewalk occupies the bottom portion, leading to a dark street pole on the mid-left and a yellow-colored building with glass doors on the far right. To the left of the sidewalk, a street with vehicles is visible, including a yellow taxi closest to the viewer and a silver car further down, with American flags hanging from buildings in the background on this side. On the right, a large dark building with display windows containing various items dominates, alongside a person in dark clothing walking away from the viewer towards its entrance. A group of pedestrians is visible on the sidewalk in the mid-ground, also moving away from the viewer, while tall city buildings rise in the background under a cloudy sky.
end of description
The person in dark clothing on the right side continues to walk away from the viewer, eventually entering the dark-colored store on the right. Concurrently, the silver car on the street on the left moves further down the street away from the viewer. The group of pedestrians on the mid-ground sidewalk also continues their movement further into the distance, away from the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame displays a city street scene with a wide concrete sidewalk in the foreground. To the left, a black lamppost stands beside a metal trash can, and on the right, a person in black clothing walks away from the viewer next to a storefront. In the midground, a group of pedestrians walks further away on the sidewalk alongside a large black building featuring "Puma" and "Citizen" logos, with dark display windows; adjacent to them, a street holds a yellow taxi and a silver car. Tall city buildings line the street into the background under a cloudy sky.
end of description
In the following frames, the person in black continues walking away from the viewer and slightly to the right, along the storefront. The group of pedestrians on the midground sidewalk also moves further away, and the vehicles on the street, including the yellow taxi and silver car, advance slowly from left to right, receding into the background. A blue digital sign showing "40%" becomes clearly visible inside the storefront window on the right side, a newly distinct detail from the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a busy city street with a dark trash can in the foreground-left, a silver car parked on the street to the left, and a group of pedestrians and a lone figure in dark clothing walking away from the viewer on the central sidewalk, flanked by a large black building and a shoe store on the right, with tall buildings and American flags in the background-left.
end of description
The person in dark clothing on the right continues walking away from the viewer, gradually moving further to the right and exiting the frame. Concurrently, the advertisement in the shoe store window to the right of the viewer changes its display. Pedestrians on the central sidewalk also continue moving away from the viewer. The cars on the street to the left remain largely in their initial positions.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
A person in a black jacket and pants walks left in the center-right foreground, holding a white object, beside a black building facade with "OPENING FALL 2023" text on the right and an ALDO shop window. To the left foreground is a dark grey trash can, beyond which a street with vehicles, including a silver car and yellow taxi, and numerous pedestrians on the sidewalk extend into the midground. Tall city buildings, some adorned with American flags and a "PUMA" sign, dominate the background.

end of description

The person in black continues walking left across the foreground, extending their arm towards the trash can on the left. They bend down slightly and discard the white object into the trash can, then continue moving out of the frame's left side. The street traffic and pedestrians in the midground and background mostly maintain their positions, with subtle movements occurring throughout the scene.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a city sidewalk bustling with pedestrians. In the bottom left, a person in a black coat is partially visible, facing away from the viewer, with a green postal box and a silver car parked on the street to their immediate left. Along the left side of the street, buildings adorned with American flags are visible, while on the right, a large black wall featuring text and a 'PUMA' store entrance lines the sidewalk where several individuals are walking towards the viewer.
end of description
Chronologically, the person in the black coat (initially bottom-left) walks forward and further left, progressively revealing more of the silver car previously obscured behind them. Simultaneously, pedestrians on the right side of the sidewalk, including a man in a white shirt and red shoes, continue walking towards the viewer, with a girl in a white top and jean shorts becoming increasingly visible walking beside him.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a bustling city street where a person in a black jacket and pants walks away from the viewer on the left sidewalk, past two green mailboxes and a silver car. Further down on the right, a PUMA store is visible with several pedestrians, including two young individuals walking towards the viewer, while American flags adorn a distant building on the far left.
end of description
As the video progresses, the person in black continues walking away, moving deeper into the scene from the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the two young individuals on the right walk past the viewer's initial position and move further away on the left, while a man previously further down the left sidewalk approaches and then walks past the viewer's original position on the left.
