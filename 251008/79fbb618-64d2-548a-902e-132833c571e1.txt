In the first frame, a busy city street is visible under an overcast sky. In the foreground, slightly to the right, a young man wearing glasses, a black jacket, and a white hoodie is looking down at his phone. To his immediate left, several other pedestrians are partially seen, including one with a distinctive brown furry hat. To the far right, a grey building column and a glass facade with an overhead canopy mark a modern building. In the midground, a wide pedestrian walkway extends into the distance, populated by numerous people walking away from the viewer, while to the left of the walkway, a street features some cars, including a yellow taxi partially visible in the far left. Dominating the background are tall, modern glass skyscrapers, one with a prominent green-blue tint.
end of description
From the initial viewpoint, the foreground man with glasses moves forward and to the left, gradually exiting the frame. Concurrently, other foreground pedestrians shift, revealing more of the street and the yellow taxi which travels from left to right in the midground. The viewpoint itself subtly moves forward and slightly right, expanding the visible pedestrian path and the building facade on the right as people continue walking away into the distance.
