The viewer faces down a city street flanked by tall buildings under an overcast sky. On the left, a white box truck and a white car are visible in the foreground, with more traffic receding. On the right, a dark SUV is parked further down the street, and a pedestrian walks on the sidewalk. Centered overhead are green traffic lights and a green street sign marking 'E 17 St', with additional vehicles visible in the distant street.
end of description
As the viewpoint gradually advances forward, the overhead 'E 17 St' sign and traffic lights move upwards and out of the frame, revealing more of the distant street. The white truck and car on the left move away from the initial viewpoint, while a yellow taxi and a bus emerge further down on the left, appearing to move towards the original viewing position. Simultaneously, the pedestrian on the right walks out of view to the right, and more scaffolding becomes prominent along the building on the right side.

The first frame shows a city street with tall buildings lining both sides under an overcast sky. A yellow taxi is partially visible left-foreground, with a white bus further back, while scaffolding covers a building facade on the right. A police vehicle with flashing lights is visible in the distance ahead, surrounded by other traffic.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the taxi exits the frame and the bus passes on the left. The police vehicle remains ahead in the distance, and a street sign for 'E 18 ST' becomes fully visible overhead.

The first frame displays a city street viewed from a forward perspective, flanked by tall multi-story buildings; a green traffic light and a street sign 'E 18 ST' are overhead on the left, while several cars, including a dark one on the left and a white one in the middle distance, along with pedestrians and a parked SUV on the right, are visible leading towards a police vehicle with flashing lights in the far distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the dark car initially on the far left and the white car previously in the middle distance advance past the viewer, while the traffic light on the left changes from green to red. A yellow taxi emerges from the viewer's left and proceeds forward, and the buildings and street features on both sides, including outdoor dining structures on the right, become progressively larger and more detailed as the viewpoint approaches them from its initial position. The police vehicle with flashing blue lights, initially in the distant center, draws nearer, and the 'E 18 ST' sign, initially overhead, moves upward and out of frame as the viewpoint continues to advance.
