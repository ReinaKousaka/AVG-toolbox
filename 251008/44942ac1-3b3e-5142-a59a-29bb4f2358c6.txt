A woman with a black umbrella and a face mask stands on the left, next to a dark bus stop sign with an attached wooden bench, all on a wet paved sidewalk that extends into the distance on the right. To the left of the sidewalk, a barrier separates it from a wet road, while bushes and trees line the right side of the path, with buildings visible in the background.

The woman moves further left and out of the frame, leaving a white plastic bag on the bench directly to her right. This bag then slides off the bench and lands on the wet sidewalk below it. A black car emerges from the distant background, driving across the wet road to the left of the sidewalk. Finally, a barrel-shaped planter becomes visible to the right of the sidewalk in the mid-distance.
