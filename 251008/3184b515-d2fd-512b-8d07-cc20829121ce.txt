The first frame captures a wet city street and sidewalk at dusk or night. On the right, a building features a "H MART" sign near the top, with a "CHILI'S" restaurant directly below it, displaying a red awning and warmly lit interior through a large window. To the left, a yellow diamond-shaped pedestrian crossing sign and a black "COPY HERE" A-frame sign stand near bare trees, which line the glistening street with parked cars and distant buildings under a dark sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk, slightly shifting left. The "H MART" sign on the right, along with the yellow pedestrian sign and "COPY HERE" sign on the left, move out of frame. The "CHILI'S" restaurant becomes closer and more prominent on the right, revealing a blue "OPEN" sign inside its window. The street and background buildings on the left become more visible as foreground trees shift further to the extreme left.
