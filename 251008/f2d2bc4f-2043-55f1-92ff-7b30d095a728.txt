In the first frame, a rainy urban street is visible, with a silver car partially in the lower left foreground. A person on a scooter with a large yellow delivery box and a white car are moving away from the viewer on the wet road in the mid-ground. To the right, a dark tree trunk stands next to a wet sidewalk with black bollards. In the background, various buildings are present, notably one displaying a "KB 국민은행" sign above a brightly lit shop with a red and white striped awning. A green traffic light is visible above this shop.

The silver car in the foreground steadily moves forward and to the left, revealing more of its rear. The scooter and the white car continue driving away from the viewer, gradually receding down the street. Simultaneously, the distant traffic light changes from green to yellow, and then to red, while rain continues to visibly fall across the entire scene.

The first frame depicts a rainy urban street with a silver car partially visible in the left foreground, parked beside a thick tree trunk. In the midground, a wet crosswalk and traffic light pole stand before a street extending into the distance, flanked by buildings with illuminated storefronts on the left and a raised planter box on the right, all under a visible downpour.
end of description
The silver car slowly proceeds forward, while a motorcycle crosses the crosswalk from left to right, and a black car emerges from the far right to turn left. Subsequently, a white SUV enters from the far left, turning right across the crosswalk, as other vehicles continue to navigate the rain-soaked intersection. The heavy rain persists throughout, causing visible splashing and reflections on the wet asphalt.

The first frame depicts a rainy city street from a low sidewalk perspective. In the immediate foreground, a wet paved sidewalk features several black bollards and a manhole cover, with a tree trunk and lamppost holding signs (pedestrian crossing, no parking) prominently on the right. The midground shows a wet intersection with a zebra crossing on the left, where a white SUV turns right from the left, a dark car drives away centrally, a silver sedan drives away on the right, and a white sedan is stationary at a red light on the far right road. Buildings with storefronts, including a "KB 국민은행" sign, line the background to the left, while trees and a circular building are visible to the right under an overcast sky.
end of description
Initially, the white SUV, dark car, and silver sedan move away from the viewer across the intersection. A new white compact van then appears from the left, gradually moving closer and across the foreground towards the viewer's right as the first cars exit. Subsequently, a red car becomes visible moving away in the distant center, and a second white sedan enters the intersection from the far left as the compact van continues its movement out of view to the right. Throughout the sequence, the white sedan on the far right remains stationary at a red light, and the heavy rain persists over the scene.
