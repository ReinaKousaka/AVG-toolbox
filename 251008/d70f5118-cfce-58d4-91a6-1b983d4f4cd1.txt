The first frame depicts a wide pedestrian path adorned with scattered yellow leaves, bordered by a long row of bright yellow ginkgo trees on the left and a wooden fence separating a wooded area and a light-colored building with an 'entrance' sign on the right. Many masked pedestrians are seen throughout the midground, some walking away, others approaching or moving across the path, while partial figures are visible in the immediate foreground.

As the frames progress, the crowd of pedestrians in the midground becomes more active, with individuals closer to the viewer, and a person in a blue cap holding a white umbrella emerges from the left side of the path, walking towards the viewer's current position. Further movement reveals more people shifting positions and increasing in density along the path to the left of the prominent parking sign.
