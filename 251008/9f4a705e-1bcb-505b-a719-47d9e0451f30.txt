The first frame depicts a road scene viewed from under a dark overpass, looking towards a brightly lit exit. Multiple tram tracks run centrally, while an orange truck and a moped move forward on the left, beside a building with "GERRY WEBER" visible. On the right, a white car is ahead, with a McDonald's building and pedestrians, including a person in a red jacket, on the sidewalk.

Subsequently, the orange truck and moped continue advancing on the left. On the right, the person in the red jacket moves out of frame, and a cyclist emerges from near the viewer, riding forward past the white car. Pedestrians, including one with a stroller, also move along the right sidewalk.

A street scene under a dark overhead structure shows tram tracks running forward. To the left, an orange garbage truck proceeds away from the viewer, while a McDonald's building with a sidewalk and pedestrians is on the right. Further ahead, a white car and a cyclist move down the road towards a brightly lit distant street.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the overhead structure recedes, revealing more of the distant bright street. The orange truck drives past the viewer and exits the left of the frame, and the white car and cyclist move further ahead. Pedestrians on the right sidewalk also progress past the viewer, chronologically revealing new figures before they too exit the frame.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a city street under a dark grey overpass spanning the top third of the view. Tram tracks lead away from the viewer down the center, flanked by sidewalks on both sides, populated with pedestrians and bicycles, and lined with multi-story buildings, including a McDonald's on the right.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the overpass gradually moves upwards and out of the frame, revealing more of the buildings' heights and the sky above. Objects on the right sidewalk, such as the McDonald's sign, street signs, and an orange mailbox, recede from the viewer, replaced by a lamppost and new storefronts like "Rossmann." Meanwhile, the crowd and shops on the left sidewalk, including "Intimissimi," appear to move past the viewer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a wide city street flanked by multi-story buildings under an overcast sky. In the foreground, the road includes tram tracks on the left and a white crosswalk. To the left, a building houses retail stores like "LUSH" and "Intimissimi" with pedestrians on the sidewalk. To the right, a building with glass elements and "Rossmann" with green awnings has a busy sidewalk featuring numerous parked bicycles, scooters, and pedestrians. In the mid-ground, a white car is stopped at an intersection with traffic lights (showing green), and the street extends into the distance lined by more urban structures.
end of description
In the following frames, a pedestrian on the left sidewalk, initially further back, walks towards the viewer, moving into the mid-left area across the tram tracks. Simultaneously, a person on a bicycle on the right side of the road cycles away from the viewer, receding further into the scene along the right edge. The white car in the mid-ground remains stationary, and no new objects or scenes are revealed as the viewpoint is static.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a bustling city street from a crosswalk, looking forward at a white car stopped on the road, flanked by sidewalks with pedestrians and parked bicycles. Multi-story buildings, including shops like Rossmann and Berlitz, line the street under an overcast sky, while two prominent green traffic lights stand, one to the viewer's left and another to the right, with a blue arrow sign also on the left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street, causing both the left and right traffic lights, along with the blue directional sign, to move out of the frame towards their respective sides. This forward movement reveals more of the street, including an orange information pillar on the left sidewalk (initially behind the left traffic light) and extended railings on the left, while the white car ahead appears closer. Pedestrians on both sidewalks continue to move, adding to the dynamic urban scene.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a city street viewed from a low vantage point. To the viewer's left, a dark guard rail runs parallel to tram tracks, behind which is a tram stop with a yellow 'H' sign and an orange cylindrical object. Further left stands a multi-story building with "Berlitz" and "ÄRZTE" signs. A white car drives away from the viewer in the center lane, while to the right, a busy sidewalk features numerous parked bicycles and pedestrians alongside a large glass-fronted building with ground-floor shops. The background shows more urban buildings under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera moves forward along the street. The orange cylindrical object, initially to the left of the viewer, quickly exits the frame. The yellow bus stop sign also to the left, moves closer and larger, revealing more text, including 'BVG' at its base. Similarly, the buildings on both sides of the street and the people on the right sidewalk become progressively closer and larger as the viewpoint advances. The white car ahead maintains its position relative to the advancing viewpoint but remains in the distance.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a city street from a forward perspective, with a white car in the central distance. To the left, a tram line with metal barriers runs alongside a sidewalk with pedestrians and multi-story buildings like 'Berlitz' and 'ÄRZTE'; to the right, a sidewalk busy with pedestrians and parked bicycles abuts commercial buildings, some with reflective facades.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the white car recedes further down the street, and the initial lamppost on the viewer's immediate left passes out of frame. A new lamppost emerges closer on the left, while buildings and sidewalks on both sides become more detailed. This progression reveals a clearer yellow sign on the tram line in the mid-distance to the left, and more parked bicycles along with a prominent blue parking sign to the right.
