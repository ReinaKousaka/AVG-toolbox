The first frame depicts a narrow cobblestone street lined with multi-story buildings, extending into the distance under a partly cloudy sky. On the left, colorful timber-framed buildings house street-level shops, while buildings on the right are more subtly toned; in the immediate foreground, a person in an orange sweater and blue bag walks away from the viewer, with a white van partially visible on the far left.

The person in the orange sweater and their companion move further away from the viewer down the street. Subsequently, a person on a bicycle emerges from the far left, riding towards the viewer, eventually passing the orange-sweatered individual. Other pedestrians further down the street subtly change their positions as the scene progresses.

The first frame depicts a cobblestone street lined with colorful, multi-story buildings featuring shops at ground level and residential windows above. In the foreground, slightly left of center, a person in an orange top and grey pants with a blue bag walks away from the viewer, accompanied by another person in a dark coat and blue jeans walking to their right. Numerous other pedestrians are visible further down the street under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
A person on a bicycle, wearing a grey jacket and helmet, enters from the far left foreground in the subsequent frames, cycling towards the right and moving away from the viewer. The two main pedestrians in the foreground continue walking further into the street, maintaining their relative positions. The cyclist moves progressively across the foreground, eventually exiting the frame to the right as the other pedestrians become smaller in the distance.
