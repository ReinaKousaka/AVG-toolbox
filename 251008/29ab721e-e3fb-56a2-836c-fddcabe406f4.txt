The first frame depicts a vibrant street scene under a long ceiling of myriad blue string lights extending into the background. To the right, a building facade displays large purple and green advertising posters, while to the left, a street features a metro entrance (Auber), a lamppost, and trees. Pedestrians populate the midground, with a person's head and shoulder visible in the bottom-center foreground and another woman on the far right walking towards the viewer.

Across subsequent frames, the blue ceiling lights dynamically flicker and sparkle, altering in intensity along their length. Concurrently, pedestrians move through the scene, with the woman on the right exiting the frame and foreground figures shifting, suggesting a subtle forward progression from the initial viewpoint.
