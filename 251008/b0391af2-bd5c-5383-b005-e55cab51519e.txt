The first frame displays a rainy street scene. On the far left, a dark tree trunk is partially visible. A wet, grey road extends diagonally from the left foreground towards the midground, with a dark car driving away from the viewer on it. To the right of the road, a row of trees with green and brownish foliage lines a wet, green-colored sidewalk/bike path, stretching into the background. A blue street sign is attached to a pole near the path in the midground. Distant buildings are visible on the left side of the road, and rain is visibly falling across the scene.

The dark car on the road in the midground continues to move away from the viewer. Subsequently, a dark SUV appears further back on the left side of the road, also moving away. Later, a white hatchback enters the frame from the lower-left, drives past the viewer on the road, and continues moving away into the distance, as rain persistently falls across the entire scene.

The first frame shows a wet street scene from the perspective of someone standing on a sidewalk. Immediately to the viewer's right is a green path, alongside which a row of tree trunks and green foliage extend into the distance. To the viewer's left, a wet asphalt road stretches forward, marked by a faint yellow line, with a white SUV moving away in the middle distance. Across the road, a median with green bushes separates the lanes, and buildings are visible further in the background to the left.
end of description
The white SUV continues to move away from the viewer along the wet road, progressively receding into the distance and eventually disappearing behind the foreground tree and other elements. Subsequently, a silver SUV emerges from the left, much closer to the viewer on the road. This silver SUV then drives past the viewer, also moving away into the distance, leaving tire spray on the wet asphalt. The rainy conditions and reflections on the ground remain consistent throughout the sequence.

The first frame captures a rainy urban street scene with a wet asphalt road extending into the distance on the left, where a silver SUV is driving away from the viewer, creating a splash of water. To the right, a wet sidewalk features a green path, several trees, and a dark fence, leading to a person walking away under an umbrella in the mid-distance, while modern buildings and a tree-lined median are visible across the road in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the silver SUV moves continuously further away from the viewer on the wet road, its taillights briefly glowing red, until it completely disappears from the visible scene into the far distance. Concurrently, the person on the right sidewalk also steadily recedes further away from the viewer, becoming less distinct as they proceed down the path.
