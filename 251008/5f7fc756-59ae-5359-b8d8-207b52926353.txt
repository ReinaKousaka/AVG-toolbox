The first frame shows a nighttime street scene from the perspective of a person standing on a wet, paved sidewalk. To the viewer's immediate right is a dark, textured wall, with a small red and yellow sign attached near the top. To the left, a series of storefronts line the sidewalk under a dark blue awning; the closest is an open entrance revealing a brightly lit, turquoise-blue interior with a red emergency sign on a distant wall and white steps on the floor. Further left, several closed glass windows emit soft light, and the wet street beyond them reflects red and yellow lights from distant vehicles and buildings.

Beginning from the second frame, the turquoise-blue wall inside the prominent open entrance starts to slide to the right, progressively revealing more of the interior space beyond it. This movement exposes a darker doorframe and patterned floor tiles deeper inside the building, to the right of the initial view. By the fifth frame, a dark-paned door is fully visible further within the space, along with a row of circular light fixtures on the ceiling above it. The turquoise wall continues to retract, eventually almost entirely disappearing to the deep right, completely opening up the view to the dark-paned door and illuminating ceiling fixtures.

The first frame shows a wet city street at night, looking down a long thoroughfare. To the viewer's right, a building features multiple glass storefront windows, topped by a blue awning. The closest window is largely obscured by a bright blue/cyan light, though a red square object with a white symbol is visible near its center on the glass. A wet, reflective cobblestone sidewalk runs along the right, while a similarly wet street, reflecting blurred red lights from distant vehicles and streetlights, occupies the left side, flanked by buildings illuminated with warm lights.

The prominent blue/cyan illumination on the far right storefront window gradually recedes to the left, revealing a brightly lit interior. As the blue light diminishes, a pink garment on a mannequin and a "HAVIKEN" sign become visible inside this window, which is situated to the right of where the red object was initially visible. Concurrently, a door handle on the rightmost glass panel and text "ONIN 323" further right inside are revealed.
