The first frame displays a large, dark-grey corrugated building dominating the view, angled slightly away from the viewer. On its left facade, white text reads "GRANVILLE ISLAND STAGE," while a large 'A' logo and "ARTSCLUB THEATRE COMPANY" are visible on its right. Below the main structure, a lighter-colored, corrugated awning extends over a section of windows, one reflecting reversed text. On the roof towards the upper left, a small red and white flag flutters, with a cloudy sky providing the backdrop above the building.
end of description.
In the following frames, the scene remains essentially the same as the camera subtly zooms out or tilts slightly upwards, revealing a proportionally larger area of the cloudy sky above the building and a slightly smaller section of the lower awning relative to the initial viewpoint. No new objects or scenes are revealed; it is a minor re-framing of the existing elements.
