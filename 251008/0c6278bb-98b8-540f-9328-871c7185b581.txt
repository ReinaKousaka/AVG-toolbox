The first frame captures a rainy night scene on a city street, with a white sedan occupying the front-right and a white minivan parked on the wet sidewalk to its left, alongside multiple trees. Across the glistening road, buildings displaying illuminated signs, notably "Daiso" in the midground, line the street. Heavy rain visibly streaks down, reflecting the vibrant city lights.

Following this, the continuous heavy rainfall persists, intensifying the reflections on the wet surfaces of the road and sidewalk. A blue pickup truck in the midground slowly advances across the street from right to left. Other vehicles in the far distance on the left side of the road subtly move forward, while the overall scene and viewpoint remain static.

The first frame depicts a rainy city street at night. In the foreground to the right, a portion of a white car, specifically its rear wheel and fender, is visible. A prominent brown tree trunk stands in the mid-ground to the right, partially obscuring a white minivan parked curbside in the mid-ground, center-left. To the left, a wet sidewalk with reflective puddles stretches past several smaller trees and illuminated storefronts. The background reveals a wet street reflecting city lights and numerous buildings with glowing signs.

In the subsequent frames, the white minivan, initially parked in the mid-ground, begins to move forward and to the left, pulling away from the curb. The vehicle progressively drives further down the wet street, appearing smaller as it moves away from the first-frame viewpoint. It continues to shift towards the left side of the scene, gradually exiting the frame. The parked white car to the right and the overall rainy street environment remain unchanged.
