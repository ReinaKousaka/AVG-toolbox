The first frame shows a multi-lane road from a driver's perspective under a bright, hazy sun high in the sky. To the left, a red car is next to a guardrail, with several large buildings and sparse trees behind it. The main road ahead features a white car in the mid-right, bordered by a median with palm trees and bare trees extending into the distance on the right, where streetlights also line the road.
end of description
The red car, initially in the lower left, moves forward and exits the frame to the upper left. Simultaneously, the white car ahead on the right also progresses forward along the road. As the viewpoint advances, a traffic light pole, located further along the road in the mid-right, becomes fully visible. Its lights transition from green/off to yellow, then fully red, causing the white car to slow. Further along the road on the far right, additional buildings and construction cranes are progressively revealed in the distance.
