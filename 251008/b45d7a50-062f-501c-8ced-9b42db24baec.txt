The scene depicts a narrow, wet city street, viewed from a slightly elevated position on the right-hand sidewalk. A white and blue traffic cone stands in the immediate foreground on the right, next to a building with potted plants and a utility pole displaying a '30' speed limit sign. On the left, a row of multi-story buildings with various shops and awnings line the street, on which a person holding a black umbrella is visible walking away from the viewer in the middle distance. The background shows more urban buildings under an overcast sky.

end of description

The person with the black umbrella steadily walks towards the viewer along the street, moving from the middle distance into the nearer foreground and shifting slightly from the center-left to the left side of the road. The surrounding buildings and street remain static, with no new objects or scenes revealed throughout the sequence.
