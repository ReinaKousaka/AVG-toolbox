In the first frame, a wide stone staircase leads from the viewer's immediate foreground into the mid-ground, framed by metal handrails adorned with string lights on both sides. An individual wearing a dark coat and white mask descends on the right side of the stairs, closest to the viewer, with two more people descending further up. In the background, an escalator and a modern building with horizontal lights are to the left, while a building with a large illuminated column and a McDonald's sign is visible on the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the masked individual on the right descends further down the staircase and exits the frame to the lower right. Concurrently, the two people higher up the stairs continue their descent, moving closer towards the viewer's original first-frame viewpoint within the scene.

In the first frame, a wide, illuminated staircase descends towards the viewer, flanked by metal railings decorated with string lights. Two women are walking down the stairs in the mid-right; one closer in a white jacket and black skirt, and another slightly behind her in a brown top, black skirt, and white scarf. Further up the stairs, several other individuals are visible, some seated. To the right, a modern building with large glass windows and an abstract-patterned column displays a "McDonald's" sign, while to the left, an escalator ascends alongside the stairs.

end of description

The two women continue descending the stairs towards the viewer. The woman in the white jacket moves past the frame's bottom right, followed closely by the woman in the brown top, who takes out her phone while walking. Both exit the frame towards the bottom right as other distant figures on the stairs remain largely stationary.

The first frame presents a brightly lit, wide concrete staircase adorned with string lights on its metal railings, extending upwards from the viewer. To the right, a modern building with large glass windows displays a McDonald's logo and a cosmic image, while to the left, another escalator/staircase rises parallel. Several figures are on the main stairs: a man in a dark coat and mask descends mid-right, and a small group ascends mid-left.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the man on the right staircase visibly moves downwards, closer to the viewer. Concurrently, the group on the left side of the stairs continues to ascend, moving further away from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A wide stone staircase, illuminated by overhead lighting, ascends diagonally from the bottom-center towards the upper-left of the frame. On the left and right, silver metal railings adorned with decorative lighting trace the stairs, with a ribbed white wall on the far left and a glass-fronted building displaying "McDonald's" and "MCD" signs on the far right. Several people are walking up the distant stairs in the middle-ground, while a man in a dark jacket, light pants, and a white face mask stands on the right side of the stairs, roughly five steps up from the bottom, holding an electric scooter.
end of description
The man on the right side of the stairs, initially holding an electric scooter, begins descending the steps towards the viewer. He progressively moves from the fifth step from the bottom down to the first visible step. His attire also changes from a short dark jacket to a longer dark trench coat during his descent. He then moves almost entirely out of frame to the lower right, with only a small portion of his body remaining visible in the final frame.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a low-angle view of a modern indoor/covered plaza with a wide central staircase ascending directly into the background. To the viewer's left, a ribbed, light-colored wall features informational signs and an escalator carrying people upwards, running parallel to the stairs, with an illuminated railing adorned with decorative lights in the foreground. To the right, a curved glass facade building houses a McDonald's with its logo clearly visible on an upper floor, and a dark-clad person is partially visible in the immediate right foreground. Two people, one in a red coat and one in a white coat, walk up the central staircase towards the background, beneath a bright, illuminated ceiling.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the partially visible dark-clad person on the immediate right foreground progressively moves out of view towards the right side of the frame. Simultaneously, the two main individuals on the central staircase continue their upward ascent, moving further into the background. Additionally, other individuals on the escalator to the left also ascend, demonstrating continuous movement within the scene.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays an outdoor urban environment at night, featuring a wide, ascending stone staircase in the center, flanked by railings adorned with small white lights. To the viewer's left, a ribbed, light-colored wall runs parallel to the stairs, with two dark information panels and a white pillar located closer to the foreground, and an escalator ascending further back. To the right, a multi-story building with a curved glass facade and horizontal strip lighting rises, displaying a 'McDonald's' sign near its top and illuminated retail spaces at ground level. Several individuals are present on the staircase, including two women ascending in the lower-middle, and others further up and on the escalator. The ceiling overhead, visible towards the top, is brightly lit, illuminating the path upwards.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the two women initially in the lower-middle of the staircase continue to ascend, moving further away from the viewer towards the top of the stairs. Other individuals visible on both the staircase and the escalator also progress upwards, moving into the distance. No new objects or scenes are revealed as the camera remains static.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A wide staircase with illuminated banisters stretches upwards from the foreground, flanked by a horizontally ribbed wall on the left and a curved glass building facade on the right. On the left, an escalator runs parallel to the stairs, while various people ascend both the stairs and the escalator towards the brightly lit overhead canopy. Two prominent individuals, one in a light coat and another in a darker coat with a red accessory, are positioned centrally on the lower half of the main staircase, walking upwards.
end of description
The individuals on the central staircase, including the two prominent figures, progressively move upwards, nearing the top of the stairs. Simultaneously, the people on the escalator to the left steadily ascend. New pedestrians appear at the bottom of both the staircase and the escalator, commencing their upward journey.
