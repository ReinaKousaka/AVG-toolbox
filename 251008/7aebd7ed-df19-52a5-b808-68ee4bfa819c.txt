The viewer is positioned on a paved city street, looking forward into a modern urban landscape. To the left, a grassy median and sidewalk are bordered by orange and black traffic cones, with parked cars and multi-story glass buildings beyond them. To the right, a line of cars is parked along the curb, backed by street lamps, trees, and more commercial buildings, including one with a light blue section and dark construction barriers. In the mid-ground, a red car drives down the central lane, surrounded by other vehicles, while numerous tall buildings recede into the cloudy horizon.

The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the street. The orange and black traffic cones and the yellow road marking, initially on the left side of the first frame, progressively enlarge and pass, moving to the left and behind the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the parked cars and buildings on the right also advance closer and then recede behind the original right-side perspective. Further ahead on the left, more parked vehicles and a "LEFT LANE MUST TURN LEFT" sign on a pole become increasingly visible and closer within the frame.

The first frame displays a multi-lane city street extending forward. To the left, a median with trees and a lamppost holding a 'LEFT LANE MUST TURN LEFT' sign leads to distant buildings; a red car is in the left lane. To the right, parked cars line a sidewalk with trees and tall glass buildings behind; a black car is in the right lane. A dense cityscape is visible in the background under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward, causing both the red car (which turns its brake lights on and initiates a left turn) and the black car to recede further away from the first-frame viewpoint. A 'P' parking sign becomes increasingly clear on the left, while pedestrians on the right sidewalk also grow more defined as the viewpoint approaches the intersection ahead.

The first frame displays a city intersection on a clear day. In the immediate foreground, a black sedan is positioned centrally on the road, with a red car partially visible on the far left. White road markings are visible on the asphalt in front of the viewer. To the left, a street light pole with a blue parking sign stands near a curb, beyond which are parked cars and multi-story buildings. A landscaped median with small trees separates traffic lanes ahead. To the right, a sidewalk with pedestrians and tall glass-fronted buildings line the street, with traffic lights showing green signals suspended above. In the background, a dense urban skyline is visible under a partly cloudy sky.

end of description

The black sedan gradually moves forward, away from the viewer, while the red car on the far left moves completely out of the frame. As the viewer advances, the road markings directly in front change, revealing more of the intersection and new white dashed lines. The street light pole and buildings on the left, as well as the street lights and buildings on the right, appear to recede slightly, and more parked cars become visible further down the street on the left. Pedestrians on the right sidewalk continue their movement, and the traffic lights remain green as the scene progresses forward.
