In the first frame, a wooden boardwalk extends from the viewer's lower center into the mid-distance, where a person wearing dark clothing and a crossbody bag walks away. To the viewer's immediate left, a large, dark rock formation dominates the foreground, while low green and brown vegetation and scattered rocks line both sides of the boardwalk. In the mid-distance to the right, a rocky riverbed with light blue water is visible, and the background features mountains shrouded in mist under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the boardwalk, the person continues walking away from the first-frame viewpoint, gradually moving further into the distance. The large rock formation on the left recedes out of view, revealing more dense green and brown vegetation and rocks that were previously further down the path. To the right, additional sections of the rocky riverbed and the misty mountain range unfold into view, with a bare, thorny bush emerging on the right side of the boardwalk in the mid-distance as the camera progresses.
