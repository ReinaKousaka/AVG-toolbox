The first frame shows a rainy night street scene. On the far right, a large yellow-orange sign advertising "Summer" drinks and food partially obscures a dark car parked on the right sidewalk. To the left of the car, two individuals walk away from the viewer on the wet sidewalk, one holding a red umbrella and the other a white one. Further left, orange traffic cones and a purple scooter are visible beside a large tree trunk. In the background, a street with car headlights reflecting off the wet pavement is visible on the left, while buildings with illuminated signs line the right side of the street.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the large yellow-orange sign on the far right gradually moves out of frame, revealing more of the dark car parked on the right sidewalk. The two pedestrians holding umbrellas continue walking away from the viewer down the wet sidewalk. Simultaneously, a distant traffic light on the left side of the street changes from red to green, and a car passes from left to right in the background street.
