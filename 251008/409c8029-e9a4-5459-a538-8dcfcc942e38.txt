The first frame depicts a rainy street scene viewed from a slightly elevated position on the right sidewalk. A wet asphalt road stretches into the distance, with a double yellow line on the left and a single yellow line on the right, reflecting overhead lights. To the left, a row of parked vehicles borders a tree-lined median, while to the right, a grated metal ramp leads up to storefronts, in front of which are two stacked black tires with a red traffic cone partially inserted into the top one. Beyond, buildings line both sides of the street under an overcast sky, with falling rain visible across the entire scene.

A pedestrian emerges on the right sidewalk, walking away from the viewer into the midground. Simultaneously, a yellow taxi appears from the left side of the road, behind the parked cars, and moves slowly forward into the midground, parallel to the viewer's left. The red traffic cone on the right sidewalk slightly shifts, appearing to slide further out of the stacked tires. Finally, a blue banner displaying Korean text unrolls or falls down the fa√ßade of the building on the far right.

The first frame presents a rainy city street stretching into the distance. To the viewer's immediate right, a sidewalk features a metal grate, leading to a building with a storefront and an open bay revealing part of a white truck within. Two black tires, stacked with a red object, rest on this sidewalk to the right. On the left side of the wet asphalt road, parked cars are visible behind a barrier, flanked by trees and distant buildings. A yellow utility van with illuminated headlights is in the mid-distance, and other vehicles are further ahead under an overcast sky.

Throughout the frames, heavy rain persists across the scene. The yellow utility van, initially in the mid-distance ahead of the viewer on the road, steadily drives closer and then passes to the left of the viewer. Simultaneously, a white pick-up truck positioned inside the garage opening to the viewer's far right becomes more fully visible.

The first frame shows a rainy street scene. To the far left, a yellow van is partially visible. A wet road with a yellow median line extends into the distance, where several cars, including a prominent white sedan in the left lane and a red car further back, drive away from the viewer. On the right, a sidewalk features a green potted plant and dark shopfronts; further right, a building with a blue sign and a white truck parked nearby are visible, along with a metal grate, a white coiled hose, and a red object on the ground. Overcast skies and falling rain are evident throughout the scene.
end of description
The yellow van on the far left drives away from the viewer. Concurrently, the white coiled hose and the red object on the far right are pulled indoors. The prominent white car in the left lane then drives past the viewer and continues down the street. Finally, a new white car emerges from the background left, driving towards the viewer, as the perspective slightly shifts, revealing more of the street to the left.
