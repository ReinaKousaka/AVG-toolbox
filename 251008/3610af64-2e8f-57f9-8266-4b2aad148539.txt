The view then shifts right, revealing a white striped pillow and a black metal headboard to the right of the floor lamp, and a second framed picture on the wall further right. Subsequently, a small white picture frame and a white vase holding the tulips become visible on a dark bedside table in the bottom left, while a polka-dotted pillow appears on the bed closer to the viewer. The bedside table is fully revealed with a white drawer and two white boxes on its bottom shelf. Finally, a white door frame on the far left opens to reveal a closet space with shelves behind it, and an additional patterned pillow appears on the bed closest to the viewer.
