The first frame displays a calm river or canal occupying the foreground and midground, reflecting the overcast sky and lush trees. To the viewer's left, a grassy bank separated by a low stone wall leads to a road with a parked white truck and car, behind which stand several traditional stone buildings and shops. A row of large, leafy trees lines the right bank, extending into the background where a small stone bridge crosses the waterway. end of description. Subsequent frames reveal only minimal dynamic changes, primarily subtle shifting ripples across the water's surface, indicating very slight environmental movement within the otherwise static scene.

The first frame presents a tranquil canal running from the bottom center towards the right foreground. A strip of green grass and a stone wall line the canal's left bank, beyond which lies a road. On this road, to the left of the canal, several stone buildings are visible, including a two-story structure on the far left with a "Martins" shopfront, and a larger building further right. A white delivery truck is parked centrally on the road, with a dark green truck behind it and a white car further to its right. The right bank of the canal is lined with mature trees, with a stone bridge partially visible in the far right distance through the foliage, all under an overcast sky.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the white car, initially seen on the road to the left of the canal, behind the trees, begins to move forward. It slowly travels further left, passing the stationary white delivery truck. The car continues its progression along the road, ultimately moving towards the far left side of the scene, away from its initial position relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame displays a river occupying the lower half, with lush green tree branches overhanging from the top and a grassy bank to its left. Across the river, on the opposite bank, buildings including 'Londis' and 'Martwells' line a road where a white delivery truck is parked to the left-center, alongside a white van further right; a stone bridge is visible in the far right midground.
end of description
Over the subsequent frames, the white delivery truck, initially parked on the road across the river, slowly begins to move forward to the right. It gradually traverses across the midground, passing by trees and extending further along the road from its first-frame position.
