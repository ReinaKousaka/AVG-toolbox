The first frame depicts a nighttime street scene with a brightly lit modern building on the right, featuring large display windows showcasing clothing and geometric patterns, and vertical light fixtures extending from poles. On the left, a wide sidewalk is lined with bare trees and dark poles, leading to a dark street in the foreground where two metallic benches are positioned on the right and several pedestrians are visible further down the left sidewalk.
end of description
As the frames progress, two pedestrians initially visible on the mid-ground left sidewalk continue to walk further away from the viewer into the distance. Concurrently, a faint red light reflection emerges on the street pavement in the mid-ground, appearing to move slightly further left and away from the viewer.

The first frame displays a night street scene dominated by a large building on the right, featuring several patterned and brightly lit display windows. On the left, a sidewalk bordered by bare trees and dark poles leads into the distance, with a metallic bench in the near foreground. A wide, empty street separates these elements under a dark sky.
end of description
Subsequently, a person carrying a light-colored bag walks from the right side of the street on the far sidewalk, moving left into the scene. Another individual in dark clothing stands further left on the same far sidewalk near a red object, remaining stationary as the first person continues walking past them.

The first frame presents a nighttime street scene with a large building on the right featuring brightly lit storefront windows displaying mannequins and merchandise. Several streetlights with vertical white lamps line the left and center, partially framed by two tree trunks in the foreground. A person in dark attire stands by a red fire hydrant to the left of center, while another person walks on the sidewalk from the right towards the left. end of description. In subsequent frames, the store window lighting dynamically shifts from white to vibrant pink and red hues, propagating across the displays from left to right, with the furthest right window eventually turning yellow. The person walking on the sidewalk continues moving from the right foreground towards the left midground, disappearing from view, while the person near the fire hydrant remains stationary.

The first frame depicts a nighttime street scene with a dark paved road in the foreground, leading to a brightly lit building facade with large display windows and 'Sale' signs in the midground. On the far left, a tall "CF Pacific Centre" sign is visible alongside tree trunks and a prominent central lamppost, while two individuals are present, one near a red fire hydrant and another walking to the right, both in the midground.
end of description
In the following frames, a blue and white public transit bus appears from the right side of the first-frame viewpoint and gradually moves left across the midground. The bus progressively obscures the building's facade and the walking person, eventually revealing a "Spicy McCrispy" advertisement on its side as it continues to traverse left past the central lamppost.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a night street scene with a blue and grey articulated bus in the mid-ground, moving left and positioned between foreground trees on the left and a street pole on the far right. Behind the bus and trees, across the street, an illuminated building with glass windows and "Sale" signs is visible, with a prominent "Pacific Centre" sign on the far left.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the bus dynamically continues its leftward movement, progressively revealing its articulated rear section and overhead trolley poles, which were previously hidden behind the street pole and to the right of the initial bus position. The front of the bus simultaneously moves further left and out of the frame, while the newly revealed rear section emerges from the right side of the first-frame viewpoint, passing across the mid-ground.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a bare tree trunk stands on the far right, with two more on the far left, flanking a utility pole displaying an illuminated "Pacific Centre" sign. Directly in front of the viewer, an articulated grey and blue trolley bus is moving from left to right across the street, its front already largely out of view on the left. Behind the bus, buildings with various illuminated windows and signs line the street on both the left and right sides, with a large, brightly lit store window visible on the mid-right. Overhead wires for the trolley bus stretch across the upper part of the frame.
end of description
The trolley bus continues its motion from left to right, gradually revealing more of its rear and the extended bright storefronts on the right side of the street, which were initially partially obscured. As the bus moves further to the right, a pedestrian and a red fire hydrant become visible on the sidewalk on the mid-right side of the street, behind the bus's initial presence.
