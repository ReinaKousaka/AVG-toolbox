The first frame depicts a road extending from the bottom center, curving slightly right, flanked by a brown grassy hillside on the left and a snow-covered bank with a concrete wall and utility poles on the right. A white car is visible in the left lane, positioned in the mid-ground and moving towards the viewer. In the mid-ground and background, houses are nestled on the slopes of hills covered in a mix of bare trees and evergreen forests, all beneath a bright blue sky with scattered clouds. A streetlight pole stands in the mid-ground, slightly left of the road.

As the scene progresses, the white car approaches the viewer from the mid-ground and then passes to the viewer's left, exiting the frame. The entire landscape, including the road, hills, and houses, appears to recede relative to the advancing viewpoint. A streetlight pole, initially in the mid-ground, moves forward alongside the viewer, eventually passing to the left. New sections of the road and the forested hillside to the right are continuously revealed ahead of the initial viewpoint.

From the viewer's perspective on a paved road curving slightly right ahead, a two-story house with green trim appears on the left, backed by a snow-dusted hillside with trees and distant buildings under a partly cloudy sky. To the right, a snow-covered bank borders the road, featuring railway overhead lines. A black car is seen on the road ahead, following the curve.

As the viewpoint progresses, the house on the left grows larger, and the black car on the road ahead approaches, then turns left onto a side road, revealing a newly visible yellow-striped pedestrian crosswalk directly in front of the viewer. The snow-covered embankment and railway details to the right also become more prominent as the scene unfolds.
