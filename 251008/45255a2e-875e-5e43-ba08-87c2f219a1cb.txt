The first frame shows a paved road curving left and uphill, bordered on the viewer's left by a guardrail and a distant forested mountain range, and on the right by a stacked concrete retaining wall with a tree-covered hillside above it, where the sun shines brightly through autumn foliage against a blue sky with white contrails.

As the viewpoint advances along the road, the guardrail and retaining wall recede, progressively revealing more of the road's leftward curve and the expanding mountain valley on the left. The sun's glint remains positioned upper-right, while a small triangular road sign and a dark rectangular opening in the retaining wall on the right emerge into view, previously hidden beyond the initial frame.

The first frame shows a paved road curving gently to the right, leading into the mid-ground. To the viewer's left, a metal guardrail runs alongside the road, beyond which are numerous trees with autumn foliage and a large, partially sunlit mountain range in the distant background. To the immediate right, a steep, grey, stepped concrete wall lines the roadside, topped by trees with autumn colors, and a small, red-bordered triangular road sign is partially visible further down the curve. The sky above is bright blue with scattered white clouds and visible contrails.

As the scene progresses, the stepped concrete wall on the right transforms into a natural rock face. The triangular road sign, depicting a wild animal, fully appears on the right rock face along with a smaller blue sign below it, before these elements move past the viewer to the right. Further along the curve, a white marker pole emerges on the right roadside and passes by as the sun's glare becomes more prominent through the trees on the upper right. A manhole cover is then revealed on the road surface in the foreground.
