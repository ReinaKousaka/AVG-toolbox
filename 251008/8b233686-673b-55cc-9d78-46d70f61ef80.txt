The first frame, viewed from the perspective of a train, shows multiple train tracks in the foreground and midground converging towards the center. Dark gray sound barrier walls flank these tracks on the left and right. In the midground, two stone-arched tunnel entrances are visible ahead, with a road bridge carrying two white cars situated above them. Overhead power lines and their support structures crisscross the upper midground. In the background, a steep, forested mountain slope rises on the left with a small building and crane visible at its base, while a green grassy slope with more trees is on the right.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the sound barrier walls and overhead power line structures rapidly recede past the viewer. The two stone tunnel entrances and the road bridge above them, featuring two white cars, grow progressively larger and closer in the midground. The tracks subtly shift, guiding the viewpoint directly towards the rightmost tunnel, which eventually fills a significant portion of the frame.
