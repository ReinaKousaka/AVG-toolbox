The first frame presents a straight-on view down a city street, featuring a white-striped crosswalk immediately at the bottom center. To the viewer's left, a sidewalk with various businesses and pedestrians runs parallel, featuring potted plants and a bike rack with bicycles; tall brick and glass buildings rise above. In the center, a green bike lane with white bollards separates the left sidewalk from the main vehicle traffic lane, where several cars, including a black SUV and a white sedan, are stopped further ahead on the right. To the viewer's right, buildings with storefronts recede, accompanied by a traffic light and street signs, all under a clear blue sky.

The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the street throughout the frames. The initial crosswalk at the bottom of the first frame moves behind the viewer's immediate position. Consequently, the white bollards separating the bike lane and the parked white sedan on the right gradually approach and then pass behind the viewer. New sections of the street and buildings further ahead are continuously revealed as the black SUV and other vehicles initially in the distance move closer, passing the viewer's position.

The first frame displays a bustling city street under a clear blue sky, featuring a light green bicycle lane centrally positioned, extending into the distance, marked with a white bike symbol and arrow. To its right, a grey car lane carries multiple vehicles, while the left side features a sidewalk lined with tall buildings, pedestrians, parked bicycles, and planters, all separated by white bollards.

As the camera steadily moves forward, the bike lane's arrow marking shifts from the midground to the foreground, indicating progression. Concurrently, vehicles in the right-hand car lane, including a black SUV and a dark sedan, advance further into the distance relative to the initial viewpoint. A cyclist on the left sidewalk, initially in the midground, begins to ride forward, passing the stationary parked bicycles.

The opening frame displays a city street view featuring a central light-green bike lane bordered by white bollards, with a sidewalk and parked bikes to its left foreground and a multi-lane road with stationary cars to its right foreground, all framed by tall buildings receding into the distance under a clear blue sky.

Subsequently, the black Tesla in the road to the right of the bike lane begins to move forward, leading the line of cars further into the midground towards the distant background. Concurrently, a person on the left sidewalk, initially obscured behind the bike rack, walks further away from the viewer. As the vehicles advance, the view subtly shifts forward, slightly revealing more of the covered scooter on the left foreground.

A bustling city street extends into the distance under a blue sky, flanked by tall buildings. In the foreground, a green bike lane with a bicycle symbol lies center-left, separated by white bollards from a sidewalk on the left, where a bicycle leans against a potted plant, and a traffic lane on the right, which features a black car partially visible on the far right.
end of description
Subsequently, the black car on the right moves forward, revealing a white arrow on the bike lane in the foreground and an orange construction barrier further right, while its rear passenger door opens. Simultaneously, a black planter replaces some bollards on the left as other vehicles progress down the street.
