The first frame shows a rainy night street scene. A prominent utility pole with yellow and black stripes stands left of center in the mid-ground, partially obscuring the wet asphalt road which reflects colorful lights. To the right, a wet paved sidewalk features a yellow A-frame sign and a person holding an umbrella, walking away from the viewer past illuminated storefronts. More buildings with glowing signs line both sides of the street, which extends into the distance towards distant traffic lights.

A silver car first emerges from behind the utility pole on the left side of the road, driving towards the viewer. It then passes the viewpoint, continuing away into the background on the right side of the road. Concurrently, the person with the umbrella on the right sidewalk steadily walks further away from the viewer into the distance.

The first frame depicts a rainy night on a city street, with a large dark utility pole partially visible on the immediate left. A wet, reflective street stretches into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings with illuminated storefronts on both sides. In the mid-right, a person holding an umbrella walks towards the viewer on the sidewalk, while a distant white car is visible on the street ahead. A yellow A-frame sign stands on the lower right sidewalk, and traffic lights are visible further down the street.

The person with the umbrella on the right sidewalk steadily approaches, moving from the mid-right foreground to just past the viewer's immediate right. Concurrently, a person initially visible on the far left sidewalk moves further away from the viewer and eventually out of frame. From the distant left, another person holding an umbrella appears on the street and walks towards the viewer, progressively moving into the mid-left foreground.

The first frame displays a nighttime street scene after or during rain, with a wet asphalt road in the foreground reflecting numerous streetlights and building signs. To the viewer's right, a wet sidewalk features a yellow A-frame sign with red Korean text. In the midground, buildings line both sides of the street, many with illuminated storefronts; a traffic light hangs centrally with a yellow signal and a red 'no U-turn' sign above it. Several pedestrians with umbrellas are visible: two on the left sidewalk (one closer, one further away) and one on the right sidewalk walking further into the distance, all receding from the viewer. The background consists of more buildings and distant city lights under a dark sky, with "Rain Everyday" text in the top right.
end of description
The traffic light in the mid-distance changes from yellow to green over the sequence. On the left sidewalk, a new pedestrian in a lighter-colored outfit carrying an umbrella walks across the foreground from left to right, passing other pedestrians before eventually exiting the frame. Simultaneously, the person with the white umbrella on the right sidewalk continues moving further away from the viewer. The yellow A-frame sign in the foreground slightly shifts forward and to the right, moving partially out of the view by the final frame. Throughout, reflections on the wet street and sidewalks show the changing light and movement of people, highlighting the persistent rainy conditions.
