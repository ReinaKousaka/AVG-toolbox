The first frame displays a covered shopping arcade stretching into the distance, flanked by storefronts. To the left in the foreground, a menu board and an information sign stand before an "au" branded store. On the right foreground, two bicycles are parked by yellow barriers next to a shop window. Many people are walking through the center of the arcade towards the background, beneath an illuminated, arched ceiling adorned with banners.
end of description
From the static viewpoint, a man initially near the left foreground sign walks across the frame past the "au" store and exits to the right. Simultaneously, several groups of people, notably one person in a bright green jacket, move from the distant background closer towards the first-frame viewpoint. Other individuals further in the arcade continue moving deeper into the background. The bicycles and storefronts remain unchanged throughout the frames.
