The first frame presents a city street view from a car, looking forward. Parked cars line both sides, with a white SUV centered ahead, flanked by buildings featuring fire escapes and bare trees, leading to a distant horizon.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer's vehicle moves forward, causing the initially foreground cars to recede and reveal new parked vehicles further down the street, relative to the first-frame viewpoint. A person briefly appears on the original left sidewalk near a parked black Jeep, followed by a traffic cone, as the viewpoint steadily advances.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a narrow city street stretching into the distance, flanked by tall buildings and bare trees; parked cars line both sides, with a dark SUV closest to the left, a white car partially visible closest to the right, and a white SUV positioned centrally further down the road.
end of description
The viewpoint advances steadily down the street as the sequence progresses. The closest dark SUV on the left and the white car on the right move out of frame, revealing parked vehicles that were previously further down the street. Concurrently, the white SUV in the middle of the road appears to slowly approach the viewer's original position, while the buildings and trees on both sides progressively reveal more details further down the street.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a narrow city street looking forward, with parked cars lining both sides; a partial grey car is on the immediate left and a red car and white SUV on the immediate right. An orange cone fragment is at the bottom left. Further down, a white SUV moves away from the viewer, flanked by buildings and bare trees, with distant high-rises visible between the trees.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the orange cone, the partial grey car, and the red car on the right quickly exit the frame. The white SUV on the right then moves mostly out of view, revealing a parked white sedan further down the street to the right. The black SUV on the left and the buildings lining the street appear closer, continuously revealing more facade and fire escape details as the viewer moves through the scene.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a street extends directly in front of the viewer, flanked by rows of parked cars on both the left and right sides. Buildings with multiple windows and bare-branched trees line the sidewalks on both the left and right, receding into the midground and background. A white SUV is visible driving away from the viewer in the middle of the street in the midground, and a yellow "SCHOOL" sign stands on the right sidewalk.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, objects previously in the foreground, like the parked cars, shift backward and out of view to the left and right, revealing new parked cars further ahead. The white SUV in the midground continues to recede further into the distance. The "SCHOOL" sign on the right also moves backward relative to the viewer, while the buildings and trees on both sides slowly move backward, revealing more of the street ahead.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a city street viewed from a moving vehicle, looking forward. Parked cars line both sides of the street, with a dark SUV partially visible in the immediate foreground on the right, directly followed by a white SUV with a yellow "SCHOOL" sign above it. On the left, a dark car is partially visible, leading a row of parked vehicles. In the midground, a white SUV drives away from the viewer in the center of the street, flanked by buildings on both sides; red-brick buildings with awnings are on the left, and taller, multi-windowed structures are on the right, interspersed with bare trees. The street recedes into the background where more distant buildings are visible under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The parked cars on both sides of the street, including the prominent white SUV on the right, move towards the bottom and rear of the frame, eventually moving out of view as the camera passes them. The "SCHOOL" sign on the right recedes and disappears from the frame as the viewer advances. Consequently, new sections of buildings and further parked cars appear from the upper and front portions of the frame as the scene continuously shifts forward.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a street scene viewed from a vehicle, looking down a city street lined with parked cars and buildings. In the immediate foreground, a white SUV occupies the right side, and a dark SUV is on the left. The street stretches into the distance, with a white SUV visible further down the middle lane and numerous other cars parked along both curbs. Buildings line both sides of the street; the left features red-brick buildings with bare trees and red awnings, while the right displays lighter-colored buildings, some with external fire escapes. Taller buildings are visible in the background against a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward, causing the white SUV on the foreground right and the dark SUV on the foreground left to gradually move out of frame. This movement reveals more of the parked cars along both sides of the street. Additionally, a few pedestrians become visible walking on the sidewalk to the right, previously obscured by the foreground vehicle.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a city street scene from a low vantage point, possibly inside a vehicle. Immediately to the viewer's front left is a partial view of a dark car, while a building with a red awning and fire escapes stands further left. On the viewer's front right, a red sports car and another parked car are visible, alongside a building with multiple fire escapes. A white SUV is centrally positioned in the street ahead, with various other cars parked along both sides of the street and forming a line of traffic extending into the midground, where an intersection with traffic lights is discernible. Tall, multi-story apartment buildings line both sides of the street into the background under a clear blue sky with sparse bare trees.
end of description
The red sports car on the far right moves forward and out of frame. This action progressively reveals a dark BMW sedan and then a silver sedan, both of which were initially to the right of the red car and subsequently move forward. Concurrently, the white SUV in the central lane moves forward down the street. A 'Subway Station' entrance sign becomes visible on the right sidewalk, behind the initial position of the red car. Finally, a pedestrian is revealed crossing the street further down the block, ahead of the now-moving white SUV.
