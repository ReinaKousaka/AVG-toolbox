The first frame presents a paved walkway extending into the distance, bordered on the left by a grassy lawn and vibrant flower beds, beyond which mountains rise. To the right, a street runs parallel, featuring buildings with red awnings and one marked "KIRCHH", along with parked cars. A person in dark clothing with a red bag is walking away from the viewer on the path, where a manhole cover is visible in the foreground.

In subsequent frames, the person on the path continues to walk further away from the viewer. Additionally, two other people appear on the street to the right, also moving away from the initial viewpoint.

In subsequent frames, the woman on the right continues walking forward, moving further away from the viewer and gradually exiting towards the far right of the scene. A person on a mobility scooter-like vehicle appears in the mid-left of the path, moving into the distance, and another individual walks towards the right near the red-awning buildings.
