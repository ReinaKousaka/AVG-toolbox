The first frame displays a wide urban sidewalk paved with gray tiles, stretching from the viewer's immediate foreground into the distance. A modern building with large, reflective glass windows lines the entire left side of the frame, showing reflections of the sky and structures opposite. On the right, a row of light-colored bollards separates the sidewalk from a street, beyond which are more buildings, including one marked "MERCER LABS," and several trees. Numerous pedestrians populate the scene; most prominently, a woman in an orange shirt walks towards the viewer on the far left, while further back, a person on a scooter and another in a patterned dress move away from the viewer, and a man stands in the mid-ground checking his phone.

The woman in the orange shirt walks progressively closer to the viewer from the left mid-ground before exiting the frame to the viewer's left. Simultaneously, the pair with the scooter continue moving away from the viewer along the sidewalk, further into the distance. An "H&M" logo, initially a faint reflection, gradually becomes clearly visible in the window of the building to the viewer's left. Throughout the frames, other pedestrians in the background continuously shift positions, walking both towards and away from the viewer.

As the camera slowly advances, the visible pedestrians move further away from the first-frame viewpoint, with those ahead appearing smaller. A man in a blue shirt on the right, initially stationary, begins walking to the right and exits the scene from the first-frame's perspective. No new major objects are revealed as the scene continuously shifts slightly forward.

In the first frame, the viewer faces down a busy city sidewalk, flanked by buildings and trees under sunny conditions. To the viewer's left is a modern building with large window panels, alongside which a man in a light purple shirt walks left-to-right in the mid-ground, while a woman in a patterned dress and a man in a blue shirt and yellow shorts pushing an object walk away into the central mid-ground. To the right, beyond several trees and bollards, is another building and a street with distant traffic lights, where multiple pedestrians are visible, including a man in a white shirt and plaid shorts walking towards the viewer on the mid-right.
