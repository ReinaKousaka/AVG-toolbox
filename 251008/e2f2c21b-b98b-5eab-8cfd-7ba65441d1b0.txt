From a narrow passage, the viewer looks onto a street at dusk, where a man in a dark jacket walks away in the mid-ground. Walls flank the view, with a sign on the left and a painted mural on the right. Across the street, several brightly lit shops with Chinese signage, including a bank and a "福旺" store, line the background, with parked cars and scooters along the curb.

The man progresses further down the street, shifting rightwards. Simultaneously, a blue covered three-wheeled vehicle enters from the far left, moving towards the viewer and then passing them, slightly expanding the view of the street on the left.
