The foreground left is dominated by a thick layer of fallen red-brown leaves. Beyond this, a dense autumnal forest extends across the mid-ground and background, featuring numerous bare tree trunks and branches interspersed with trees showcasing vibrant red foliage, particularly concentrated on the hillsides and upper left. In the mid-ground, slightly to the right of center, a small cluster of green-leaved trees stands out, and below them, a rocky stream bed with a small amount of visible water is nestled in a ravine.

The viewpoint slowly pans to the right, progressively revealing new sections of the autumnal forest and a larger portion of the rocky stream bed that lay previously unseen to the right of the initial frame. Objects initially visible in the first frame, such as the cluster of green trees in the mid-ground, maintain their position within the overall landscape while new elements continuously emerge further to the right.

The first frame shows a dense autumn forest. In the immediate foreground, a mound of reddish-brown fallen leaves covers the bottom left and center. Further back, a vibrant mix of bare trees and trees with red and orange foliage fills the midground and background, ascending a slope. Several green-leafed bushes are prominent in the lower-mid section, while a rocky stream bed with dark water is visible in the lower right.

The view subtly pulls back and shifts slightly to the right, revealing more of the rocky gully and stream bed to the lower right of the initial position. The prominent green foliage in the mid-ground moves slightly further away, allowing the dense autumn forest to expand, showing more depth and width to the overall scene.

The first frame displays a vibrant autumn forest from an elevated perspective, looking down into a shallow ravine. The foreground ground is entirely covered in a carpet of red-orange fallen leaves, with intertwining bare branches and some small green bushes prominent on the right. A narrow stream flows through the midground from the distant background, flanked by numerous deciduous trees with a mix of bare branches and red-orange foliage. The background reveals a dense forest hillside, richly colored with red and orange autumn leaves, extending upwards.

The viewpoint then smoothly glides forward and slightly to the right, subtly revealing more of the midground stream and the right-side forest elements. Throughout this movement, the green bushes on the right appear to shift slightly closer to the viewer's original position as the scene progresses.
