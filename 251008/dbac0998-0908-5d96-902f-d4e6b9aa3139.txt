From a forward-facing perspective, an asphalt road curves to the right ahead, bordered on the left by a metal guardrail and a chevron sign, and on the right by a grassy slope with a stone wall, all beneath a bright blue sky with dense pine trees lining both sides.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the initial guardrail and chevron sign on the left recede and move out of frame from the first-frame viewpoint. Further along the road, a red and white roadside marker pole becomes visible on the right, appearing ahead of the first-frame viewpoint and then approaching. The winding road gradually straightens out ahead, revealing more distant forest sections and sky.
