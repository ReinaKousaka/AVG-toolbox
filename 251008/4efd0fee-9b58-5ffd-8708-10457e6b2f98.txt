The first frame shows a street scene on an overcast day. In the foreground, an asphalt road with a white dashed line runs towards the right, flanked by orange and white traffic bollards on its right edge. To the left of the road is a paved pedestrian area with young trees planted in square beds and a brown wooden bench. Behind this, a colorful public square features vibrant blue, yellow, and pink outdoor seating or umbrellas, with structures adorned by large murals depicting people visible on the far left. The background reveals traditional buildings under a grey sky, and the text 'THEATER SQUARE' is superimposed on the lower left.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The road, bollards, trees, and the colorful square on the left recede into the distance, revealing more of the street ahead and the buildings on the right. A white car appears from the mid-right, driving further down the street, and additional parked cars become visible along the right side of the road as the camera advances.

In the first frame, a street scene unfolds under an overcast sky. A paved road stretches into the distance, with a series of orange and white flexible bollards defining the driving lane on the viewer's right and a white solid line on the left. To the immediate right, several cars are parked parallel to the curb, while a white SUV with visible brake lights is positioned ahead in the driving lane. To the left, a pedestrian area features small trees in planters, dark bollards, a large yellow planter, and an open space with numerous colorful deck chairs and blue umbrellas. Various multi-story buildings, including a large light-colored one on the far right and more distant structures, line both sides of the street.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the street. The white SUV ahead gradually drives further into the distance, and its brake lights briefly illuminate before dimming. Consequently, the parked dark blue SUV previously visible in the foreground on the right slightly recedes from view, revealing more of the cars parked further down the street. The entire scene shifts forward, revealing more of the street ahead and the buildings in the mid-distance.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a street scene with a white SUV positioned directly ahead of the viewer in the road, flanked on its left by orange and white bollards and on its right by a parked dark blue SUV and a black sedan. To the viewer's left is a pedestrian area featuring trees, blue umbrellas, and colorful lounge chairs, while a multi-story light yellow building lines the right side of the street. In the background, further buildings and an overcast sky are visible.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the white SUV's brake lights, located at the rear of the vehicle directly ahead, repeatedly illuminate and extinguish. These lights briefly turn on in frames 2, 4, 6, and 8, and are off in frames 3, 5, 7, and 9. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the overall scene remains static relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, the viewer is on a road behind a white car. To the right of the white car, a black car is parked at the curb, with part of another dark vehicle visible behind it. Orange-and-white bollards line the road segment to the left. Further down the street on the right, a multi-story light yellow building stands, while to the left, a green area with trees, blue flags, and people on a bench is visible. In the background, a light brown building with a dark roof and a small turret is centered, with a blue parking sign to its left.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the white car directly ahead slowly moves forward and recedes further into the distance relative to the viewer. All other objects, including the parked black car, the buildings on both sides, the trees, and the bollards, maintain their spatial positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint, suggesting the viewer's vehicle is also advancing along the street.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a street looking forward, with a white SUV directly ahead on the road, flanked by orange and white bollards. A black car is partially visible to the immediate right of the viewer. To the left is a treed area with visible people, while on the right, a sidewalk features pedestrians walking past light-colored buildings that extend into the midground and background.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the viewer's position remains fixed, and all vehicles and buildings appear stationary. The only dynamic change is a small group of people moving further away from the first-frame viewpoint along the right-hand sidewalk.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a street scene viewed from a low perspective. A white SUV occupies the center of the lane directly ahead of the viewer. To the far right, a dark vehicle is partially visible in the foreground. On the left, a row of orange and white striped bollards and a white line separate the road from a raised planter with green shrubs and trees, behind which stands a multi-story, light brown building with a dark, pointed roof. A blue parking sign and a red circular traffic sign are posted on the left. On the right, a sidewalk lined with grey bollards and green bicycle racks features several pedestrians, bordered by a large, light yellow building with an ornate entrance. The street extends into the distance, framed by buildings and trees under an overcast sky.
end of description
The white SUV ahead of the viewer progressively moves forward, appearing smaller as it recedes into the distance down the street. Concurrently, the dark vehicle to the viewer's far right slowly moves forward and exits the frame. Pedestrians on the right sidewalk also advance, and the overall perspective shifts forward, revealing more of the street and the buildings previously in the mid-ground.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A street scene from the viewer's forward perspective shows a white SUV ahead on a grey asphalt road, flanked by orange and white bollards on the left and a sidewalk with dark bollards, green bicycle racks, and pedestrians on the right. Buildings line both sides of the street with trees above, and a blue parking sign is positioned left of the SUV.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, a silver car emerges from behind the white SUV and proceeds further down the street, while a dark sedan on the far left inches forward and the pedestrians on the right sidewalk slowly advance.
