The first frame depicts a nighttime street scene at an urban intersection. To the immediate right and slightly in front is a brick-patterned pavement with yellow tactile blocks. A dark road with white pedestrian crossing stripes extends from the left across the center foreground. Across the intersection, to the left-center, is a multi-story building featuring a brightly lit ground-floor shop with a red awning. A utility pole with both green and red traffic lights stands in the center foreground, marking the intersection. Buildings and streetlights line the street extending into the distance on the right.
end of description
Following the first frame, the viewpoint slowly pans right, revealing new parts of the scene previously outside the first-frame view. A distant red light from a vehicle gradually becomes visible far down the street to the right. A red circular 'STOP' sign on a pole then emerges on the far right sidewalk, positioned further down the street than the initial intersection. As the pan continues, a light-colored rectangular object on the right sidewalk, closer to the viewer than the 'STOP' sign, becomes more apparent. Finally, a bright, white rectangular sign with a circular logo is revealed on a building facade on the far right, closer to the viewer than the distant traffic.

A city street at night is viewed from a pedestrian's perspective, with a central utility pole in the foreground. To its left, an asphalt road runs alongside multi-story buildings, including a prominent red-signed shop. To the right, a brick sidewalk extends past shuttered shops, with a glowing circular sign visible further down the street.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves steadily forward. The initial utility pole exits the scene to the viewer's left, and the red-signed shop recedes as an adjacent shop with an 'Arthur M.' sign becomes prominent on the left. Concurrently, objects on the right, including the bright circular sign, appear closer and larger as the viewer advances along the sidewalk.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a nighttime urban street, featuring a large utility pole in the central foreground that divides the road on the left from the sidewalk on the right. Buildings with illuminated storefronts like "Arthur & Murray" line the left side, while buildings with a circular neon sign, shuttered doors, a yellow cone, and a small bush are visible along the right sidewalk, all receding into the distant, streetlight-dotted background. end of description. Progressing through the frames, a person riding a bicycle emerges from the far distance on the sidewalk, steadily approaching the viewer from behind the utility pole.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a nighttime street scene is visible. To the immediate left, a dark red pole stands vertically. A paved sidewalk extends from the foreground towards the background on the right, bordered by an asphalt road to its left. On the road, yellow double lines are visible further down. Buildings line both sides of the street, receding into the distance, with illuminated windows and streetlights providing light. In the mid-ground, to the right of the center, a man on a bicycle is seen riding towards the viewer's right, away from the first-frame viewpoint. To the far right, a light-colored tiled wall with a partial sign ('L') and a yellow cone are visible near the bottom. Behind the man on the bicycle and along the right side of the sidewalk, a green bush in a planter and more buildings are present.
end of description
The man on the bicycle continues to move rapidly from the mid-right towards the far right, exiting the frame entirely by the third frame. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the remaining urban landscape remains static relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a nighttime city street, with a prominent red pole in the extreme foreground on the left. A paved sidewalk stretches into the mid-ground on the right, featuring a manhole cover closer to the viewer and a long, light-colored brick planter topped with a large green bush further down. To the left of the sidewalk, a dark street with yellow markings recedes into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings with shuttered storefronts on the left and taller, modern buildings on the right, all under a dark, street-lit sky.
end of description
A lone person emerges on the mid-ground sidewalk, walking away from the viewer. Subsequently, a delivery scooter with a large cargo box appears on the street to the viewer's left, also moving away. As these objects recede further into the distance, the camera subtly moves forward, causing the red pole previously in the foreground to exit the frame.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The initial frame depicts a dimly lit city street at night, with a red and grey brick sidewalk extending into the distance from the foreground. A utility pole stands centrally on the sidewalk, and a low brick wall with green bushes borders the right side. An asphalt road parallels the sidewalk on the left, lined by buildings and showing a distant white scooter moving away.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward, causing the utility pole, brick wall, and bushes to shift out of view to the sides. A pedestrian becomes visible walking away on the distant sidewalk, which progressively approaches the viewer. The white scooter continues to recede down the street, ultimately disappearing as more of the street and buildings further ahead are revealed.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a night-time city street, featuring a red brick sidewalk in the foreground extending centrally, flanked by a two-lane road to its left and a modern gray building to its right. Buildings with illuminated windows and signs line the left side of the street, while streetlights and power lines are visible overhead, illuminating the scene and a dark sky. A person, dressed in light clothing, walks away from the viewer along the sidewalk, positioned centrally in the mid-ground.
end of description
In the following frames, the primary dynamic change is the person continuing to walk further away from the viewer along the sidewalk, progressively diminishing in size as they recede into the distance. No new objects or scenes are revealed relative to the first-frame viewpoint; the surrounding urban environment remains static.
