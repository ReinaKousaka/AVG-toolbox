In the first frame, a prominent red wooden pillar and railing stand in the immediate foreground on the left, bordering a stone wall with dark roof tiles that recedes into the distance, separating a dirt area from a paved pathway. A person in a blue puffer jacket walks away from the viewer along this path, with two other individuals visible further ahead; to the right of the path, a low building featuring a colorful fence and a lamppost are seen. In the background, a large, multi-story building sits on a distant hill, surrounded by bare trees under a cloudy sky.

As the frames progress, the person in the blue jacket, along with the two other individuals, steadily moves further away from the viewer along the pathway, diminishing in size as they advance relative to their initial positions.

In the first frame, a person in a blue jacket is partially visible in the bottom right foreground, facing a paved path extending away from the viewer. To the viewer's left, a red pillar, traditional tiled roof, and a light-colored brick wall with leafless bushes run into the middle distance. In the midground, a person in a dark jacket walks along the path, while to the right, low buildings with decorative orange fences and a black signboard are visible. The background features hills with sparse trees and large, multi-story buildings, including a prominent modern structure on a distant hill.

As the frames progress, the foreground person in the blue jacket moves away from the viewer, shifting towards the bottom center and eventually exiting the frame to the right. Simultaneously, the person in the dark jacket further recedes into the distance along the path, as the entire scene slightly advances from the first-frame viewpoint.
