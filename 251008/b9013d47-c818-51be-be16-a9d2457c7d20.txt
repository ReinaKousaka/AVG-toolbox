In the first frame, a bustling city street scene is visible with a wide crosswalk extending across the foreground directly in front of the viewer. A woman with long dark hair, wearing a white top and blue jeans, walks away from the viewer on the crosswalk, slightly to the right of center. To her left, a black SUV moves right across the street, while a person on a scooter and another on a bicycle are further ahead on the crosswalk. On the far right, a man rides a blue public bicycle, partially obscured by a green structure that supports an overhead walkway and street signs for "W 42 ST." In the background, large commercial buildings with "CHASE" and "STEVE MADDEN" signs, along with a large digital billboard, line the left side of the street.
end of description
Following the first frame, the black SUV moves out of view on the left, while a white box truck appears from the left, crossing behind the main group of pedestrians and cyclists. The woman in the foreground steadily walks further away from the viewer across the crosswalk. A new scooter rider enters from the far left and progresses towards the right, eventually passing the main group. Concurrently, the white box truck moves across the scene and exits on the right, as a blue car then emerges from the background on the left and moves towards the right, behind the group.
