A person's back is in the foreground, facing a busy street scene with a white van and other vehicles on the left, and a massive stack of boxes and sacks dominating the right, behind which a man and an orange forklift are partially visible, all framed by tall buildings and an overcast sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the man previously behind the mid-right boxes moves away, while other people in the midground near the white van exhibit subtle movements. A man in a blue shirt then emerges from behind the stack on the mid-right, progressively moving towards the foreground right and eventually bending over a box. Simultaneously, rolled textiles and wooden poles are revealed near the bottom of the shifting box stack on the right.
