frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a nighttime scene over snow-covered train tracks, viewed from a forward perspective. A stationary train with illuminated windows runs parallel to the viewer on the left, while another stationary train is positioned to the right. Overhead, a network of electrical wires and numerous yellow numbered signs, including '10', '11', and '21', are visible. In the background, brightly lit buildings and streetlights illuminate the distant horizon.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the central tracks. The train on the left appears to recede backward relative to the viewer, while the train on the right gradually moves forward, revealing more of its front end. The distant buildings and overall scene also shift backward, indicating continuous forward motion.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows the viewer positioned on snow-dusted train tracks, looking forward at multiple converging tracks, with a train partially visible on the left and two more parked on the right, all beneath an intricate network of overhead lines and yellow streetlights. Distant illuminated buildings, including a large modern structure, are visible in the background ahead.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, a large concrete pillar emerges and progresses from the far left of the first frame's view, eventually dominating the left foreground and forming part of an overhead structure. Concurrently, a different train becomes increasingly visible to the immediate left of the viewer, appearing to pass by, while the original trains on both sides and distant buildings remain largely stationary relative to their initial positions.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The initial frame presents a night view of a train yard under an overpass, with tracks directly in front extending into the distance. A concrete pillar stands to the immediate left of the viewer, adjacent to a stationary train with a headlight, while multiple diverging tracks on the right feature two trains with red taillights. Overhead, catenary wires and bright yellow streetlights illuminate the scene, with distant buildings visible in the background.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the concrete pillar on the left moves out of frame, revealing a cargo train marked 'postnord' that gradually emerges from the left and passes toward the background, while the ground around the tracks progressively shows a covering of snow. The trains and tracks on the right remain largely stationary relative to their initial positions.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures a snow-covered train yard at night, under a brightly lit overhead bridge, revealing multiple tracks receding into the distance. To the far left, a cargo train with white "1000" containers and a dark engine showing red lights is visible, while two passenger trains with blue/white headlights are parked on tracks to the right.
end of description
As frames progress, the dark train engine on the far left begins to move forward from its initial position, revealing more of the "REMA 1000" container behind it. Its lights transition from red to white as it advances towards the left mid-ground. The train continues its slow progression, steadily moving the container and engine further left and partially out of the frame.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The initial frame presents a snowy train yard at night, with two parallel tracks in the foreground extending towards numerous stationary trains (a freight train left, red trains center, a yellow train right) and utility poles under a concrete overpass ahead of the viewer.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the tracks. The snowy ground and track infrastructure advance closer into the immediate foreground, while a large grey structure emerges from the lower-left, moving into the left foreground relative to the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, the stationary trains and overpass recede further into the background, revealing more of the tracks and surrounding elements directly ahead.
