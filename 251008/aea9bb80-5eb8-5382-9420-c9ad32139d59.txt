A wide-angle view shows a wet, bustling urban street lined with multi-story buildings adorned with numerous bright signs in Japanese characters. In the immediate foreground to the left, a person with a light blue umbrella walks away, while on the right, a gray utility pole with several signs stands next to metal barrels on a blue cart. People carrying various umbrellas, including clear and dark ones, fill the midground, walking down the paved street away from the viewer, flanked by storefronts on both sides, with more distant buildings and pedestrians receding into the background.

As the frames progress, the pedestrians continuously move forward, receding into the distance relative to the static viewpoint. The person on the far left holding the blue umbrella, and the pair with a white backpack in the left midground, move further away. A person pushing a light blue suitcase becomes visible in the central midground, and a new pedestrian with a patterned umbrella enters from the far right, also walking into the distance.

The first frame shows a wet, bustling city street in Japan, likely under overcast skies or light rain, with numerous pedestrians holding umbrellas. In the foreground, part of a clear umbrella is visible top-left, while a person with a patterned umbrella walks away to the right. The midground is filled with people walking towards the viewer, notably a person with a light blue rolling suitcase slightly left of center, and storefronts like "千里薬品" on the left. The background features towering buildings adorned with various Japanese signs and neon lights, receding down the street.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the street. The group of pedestrians initially in the mid-left, including the person with the blue suitcase, walks past the viewer towards the first-frame's background. Simultaneously, the person walking away on the right proceeds further into the distance. New pedestrians continuously appear from the far background, approaching and then passing the viewer's original position as the scene progresses down the street.

The first frame depicts a wet, bustling city street in Japan, viewed from a slightly elevated position under an umbrella. To the viewer's immediate left, pedestrians are walking, including a person in a dark coat pulling a light blue rolling suitcase and others holding umbrellas. Along the left side, buildings house shops with prominent signs, some displaying Japanese text and one labeled "BRITISH PUB." On the right, the wet pavement extends alongside a building wall, with an orange and white construction barrier visible in the mid-ground, and a menu board positioned in the near foreground. In the background, the street recedes towards multi-story buildings adorned with large signs, including "KARAOKE," under an overcast sky.

From the initial viewpoint, the person with the blue suitcase moves forward and exits the frame to the viewer's immediate left. Simultaneously, two women with umbrellas, initially in the left mid-ground, walk towards and then past the viewer, exiting the frame to the immediate left. Following them, a person with a large black umbrella, along with other distant figures, steadily approaches the viewer's position, becoming more prominent in the left foreground. The construction barrier on the right remains static as the scene progresses.

The first frame shows a wet city street on an overcast day. A sidewalk extends from the viewer's foreground into the distance, bordered by buildings on both sides. To the viewer's left, several pedestrians carrying umbrellas (some silver, one blue) walk towards the camera, passing shopfronts. On the viewer's right, a large white and orange construction barrier with Japanese text ("安全第一") obscures the immediate building facade. Numerous other pedestrians with umbrellas are scattered further down the street, which narrows into the urban background filled with multi-story buildings and signs.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, pedestrians initially on the left side, carrying umbrellas, gradually pass by the viewer. Simultaneously, the construction barrier on the right shifts to reveal more of the closed shopfronts behind it. People in the distant mid-ground recede further away, while new shopfronts and building signs emerge into view on both sides of the street. This continuous motion signifies the viewer's steady progression down the rainy thoroughfare.

The first frame captures a rainy urban street bustling with pedestrians holding umbrellas, with wet sidewalks and distant buildings visible under an overcast sky. On the left are storefronts like 'SHIBUYA ANGEL HEART CASIO,' while on the right, a building with a 'BIG ECHO' sign and an orange and white construction barrier are prominent.
end of description
As the viewpoint subtly moves forward, the orange and white construction barrier on the immediate right recedes and moves out of frame. Pedestrians on the left continue walking further away, while those on the right approach and pass by the viewer, progressively revealing more of the right-side store facades and the street ahead.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a wet city street or alleyway under an overcast sky, extending into the distance. On the left, a building with a "SHIBUYA ANGEL HEART CLUB-O" sign houses brightly lit shop windows. On the right, another building displays a "カラオケ" (Karaoke) sign and a digital billboard, with a partially obscured person holding a black umbrella and a white bag in the immediate foreground. Numerous pedestrians, many with umbrellas, are visible on the wet pavement, moving towards and away from the viewer, with a light pole standing slightly right of center in the midground.
end of description
The camera slowly advances forward down the street. The person with the black umbrella and white bag on the far right moves out of view, while other pedestrians on the left and in the midground continue to change their relative positions as they walk. The shopfronts on both sides become increasingly closer and more detailed, revealing more of the "SHIBUYA ANGEL HEART CLUB-O" shop on the left. The wet pavement and manhole cover in the foreground gradually move towards the bottom of the frame and then out of view as the camera progresses.

The first frame depicts a wet city street on an overcast day, viewed from under a translucent umbrella, with a brightly lit "Shibuya Angel Heart" shop on the left and a building featuring a digital billboard and shuttered stores on the right. Pedestrians carrying umbrellas fill the mid-ground, walking away from the viewer down the paved street, which is marked by a central utility pole.
end of description
Across the subsequent frames, the group of pedestrians on the left, near the "Shibuya Angel Heart" store, steadily moves further away from the viewer down the street. Simultaneously, other individuals and groups in the mid-ground, ahead of the utility pole, also advance deeper into the scene, with the wet pavement reflections subtly changing with their movement.
