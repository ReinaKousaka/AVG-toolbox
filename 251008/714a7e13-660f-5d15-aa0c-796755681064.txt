frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame captures a nighttime city street scene, likely in winter, with numerous pedestrians traversing snowy or icy ground. In the immediate foreground, a person in a brown hooded jacket with fur trim is seen moving towards the viewer on the left, while the back of a person in a black jacket and shoulder bag occupies the central mid-foreground, facing away. Further back, on the left, individuals in black hooded and beige puffer jackets walk towards the viewer, and on the right, a person in a white puffer coat and mask walks away on a crosswalk. The background features tall buildings with illuminated windows, streetlights, and traffic lights, one red and one green, above and to the left.
end of description
As the frames advance, the person in the brown jacket moves further left, eventually exiting the frame, while the traffic light above and to the left changes from red to green. The people initially walking towards the viewer, including those in the black hooded and beige puffer jackets, continue their movement to the left, revealing more of a decorative tree adorned with blue lights. Concurrently, the central person in the black jacket begins walking forward and slightly left, and the person in the white puffer on the right continues moving away across the crosswalk, gradually leaving the frame to the right as pedestrians disperse.

The first frame shows the back of a person in a black coat, positioned centrally in the foreground, facing away from the viewer on a crosswalk with several other pedestrians ahead. To the left, a modern building with illuminated signs and a decorative light display is visible, while beyond the pedestrians, a construction site with white barriers and more distant city buildings under a dark night sky complete the scene.
end of description
As frames progress, the pedestrians initially visible continue moving forward across the crosswalk away from the viewer. New individuals emerge into the scene; one person in a black coat and mask appears from the left, passing closer to the viewer than the construction barriers, followed by another in a brown scarf from the far left, and then a man's face becomes visible from the bottom-left foreground. The pedestrian traffic light, initially red to the left of the central group of pedestrians, dynamically changes to green in frame 7.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The foreground shows the backs of several pedestrians, including a person in a dark coat on the far left, a woman in a grey puffer coat with a pink scarf holding a white bag near the center, and another person in a dark coat on the right. A striped crosswalk extends from the viewer into the midground, where multiple pedestrians are walking away from the viewer and one person in a black coat with a briefcase walks towards the viewer on the right. To the left of the crosswalk stands a green traffic light, while tall illuminated buildings line the left and center background behind white construction barriers, all under a dark night sky. A delivery scooter and a car are visible on the right side of the street.
end of description
The pedestrians on the crosswalk, including the woman in the grey coat and the person with the briefcase, continue moving forward. The traffic light to the left of the crosswalk remains green, displaying a changing letter (B, then A) likely indicating a countdown or walk signal. As people advance, more of the snowy ground and the far right side of the street become slightly more visible relative to their initial positions.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a night street scene from a crosswalk, with a person in a grey coat and pink scarf directly in front of the viewer, facing away, and another person partially visible to the far left. Ahead, a group of pedestrians crosses the street, moving towards a distant construction barrier backed by illuminated city buildings and a green pedestrian light.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the group of pedestrians steadily walks across the crosswalk, moving further away from the viewer into the background. Simultaneously, the person in the foreground in the grey coat advances, gradually moving out of the bottom right of the frame. The person partially visible on the far left also continues to walk forward, further into the midground.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a night street scene is viewed from behind a person in a gray coat and pink scarf, standing on a crosswalk in the bottom right. Another person in a dark coat is partially visible in the bottom left, also on the crosswalk. A group of approximately 7-8 people walks away from the viewer on the crosswalk towards the center-left. To their left, a black kiosk and a traffic light with a green pedestrian signal are visible. Across the mid-background, a large white construction hoarding with blue netting extends, behind which modern glass buildings with illuminated windows are seen. The ground along the crosswalk and sidewalk has patches of snow.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the group of people in the midground continues walking away from the viewer, moving across the crosswalk and onto the sidewalk behind the construction hoarding. The pedestrian signal on the left displays a countdown, decrementing from 7 to 5 while remaining green. Concurrently, the person at the bottom left moves further into the frame, also walking forward. A new individual, wearing a light brown coat, emerges from behind the construction hoarding on the far right and proceeds to walk leftward across the sidewalk, eventually moving further into the scene.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, the viewer observes a city street at night with patches of snow. In the immediate foreground, a person in a dark coat walks away from the viewer towards the right, adjacent to a dark utility box adorned with posters on the left. A traffic light pole with a green 'walk' signal stands slightly left of center. Directly ahead, a group of five people walks away from the viewer, crossing the street towards a construction hoarding wall that spans the mid-ground. To the far right, another individual in a light-colored coat walks away, parallel to the hoarding. Tall, illuminated city buildings rise in the background beneath a dark sky.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the individual in the foreground continues walking away and towards the right, progressively exiting the left side of the frame. Concurrently, the group of people crossing the street advances forward and to the right, gradually moving further into the mid-distance. The person on the far right also continues walking away, eventually moving beyond the right edge of the frame. No new objects or scenes are revealed; only the existing people change their positions relative to the static background.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a nighttime city street with patches of snow on the pavement. In the immediate foreground, a person in a black puffer coat and cap walks away from the viewer, slightly towards the left. To their left, a grey kiosk with Korean text stands next to a pole featuring a green pedestrian traffic light. In the mid-ground, a group of five people walks away from the viewer towards the right, past a long, light grey construction barrier that dominates the background, behind which illuminate tall city buildings. A second grey pole is positioned in the mid-ground on the far right.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, the person in the black puffer coat continues walking away and to the left, gradually nearing the bottom left corner. Concurrently, the group of five individuals in the mid-ground proceeds further away and to the right. A new person, partially visible with a brown bag and light blue pants, appears on the far left of the scene, behind the initial foreground person, also moving right and away. The background buildings, construction barrier, and street furniture like the kiosk and poles remain stationary from the first-frame viewpoint, with the pedestrian light consistently displaying green.
