The first frame displays a sunlit gravel path extending forward and curving gently into the distance from the bottom center, flanked by vibrant green grassy fields on both sides. To the left, a gentle slope of grass extends upwards, while to the right, scattered trees with some autumn colors and denser woodland line the field towards the background, all beneath a clear blue sky. On-screen data overlays are visible in the bottom left and right corners.

As frames progress, the viewpoint moves continuously forward along the path, causing the immediate foreground elements like the gravel path and adjacent grassy areas to recede further away relative to the viewer's initial position. Concurrently, the mid-ground trees and the distant landscape previously visible to the right and ahead in the first frame appear progressively closer and larger as the journey unfolds, shifting their relative positions within the expanding view. The on-screen data overlays in the bottom corners update to reflect the passage of time and distance covered.

A gravel path extends from the bottom center towards the middle distance, flanked by vibrant green grassy fields. The field on the left slopes uphill, while the one on the right is relatively flat, backed by a line of deciduous trees with some autumnal leaves and bare branches further in the distance. The sky above is clear blue, and a green vertical progress bar with a "6.7 km" marker is visible on the far left, while performance metrics like pace, speed, and time are displayed in the bottom right corner.

Over the subsequent frames, the scenic landscape remains spatially unchanged from the initial viewpoint, implying a static camera position. However, the informational overlays update: the distance marker on the left progresses from 6.7 km to 6.8 km. Simultaneously, the displayed pace and speed values on the bottom right shift, for instance, from "06:07/km" and "18 km/h" to "06:16/km" and "18 km/h" (after an interim drop to 9 km/h), while the elapsed time incrementally advances.
