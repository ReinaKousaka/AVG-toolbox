In the first frame, dense green foliage occupies the foreground left, with a traditional Chinese pavilion elevated in the mid-left-center above a rock garden and a narrow stream. A paved path extends from the mid-right into the background, where several people walk amidst lush trees, with a traditional building visible far right.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward and slightly to the right. The paved pathway on the right expands its visible area closer to the viewer's original position, and the individuals on it advance further into the background. Simultaneously, the dense foreground foliage on the left shifts, revealing more of the rock garden and the stream's edge that were previously obscured from the initial viewpoint.
