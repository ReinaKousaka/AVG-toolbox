In the first frame, a multi-story house with a red-tiled roof, dark wooden upper facade, and white lower walls stands centrally behind a green chain-link fence and grassy foreground, with a blurred bright green bush partially visible on the far right. To the left of the main house, a wooden extension with a similar roof features a rainbow-colored sign, and a segment of another wooden building is visible further left.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the camera pans right, gradually revealing a new brown wooden house appearing from the far right of the frame, positioned behind the foreground fence and grass. Concurrently, a vast, green mountain range emerges into the distant background, extending to the right behind the houses, while the initial foreground bush slowly moves further right and partially out of frame.
