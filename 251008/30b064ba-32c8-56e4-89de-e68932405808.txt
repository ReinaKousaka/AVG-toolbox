The first frame shows the viewer positioned beneath a reddish-brown brick archway, which frames the upper portion and extends down the left side. Ahead, a bright, overcast sky is visible, with a murky green canal stretching from the mid-ground towards the distance on the right, reflecting the sky. To the left of the canal, a narrow, muddy path runs along a strip of vibrant green grass, bordered by the brick wall on the far left. Beyond the canal on the right are dense green bushes and trees, while a grassy field with a small, mounded clump of vegetation is seen in the distance, slightly to the left.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward and slightly upwards, gradually revealing more of the open sky and landscape ahead. The reddish-brown brick archway recedes, eventually disappearing from above the viewer, revealing more of the leafy branches and trees that were previously partially obscured on the left. The canal and path become more central and expansive as the camera emerges from the underpass, making the distant green fields and scattered trees appear closer and clearer to the viewer's front.

A narrow dirt path along a grassy bank stretches into the distance on the left, running parallel to a murky canal on the right, which also extends forward. Dense vegetation borders both banks, with a large bare-branched tree immediately to the viewer's upper left, while a green field and cloudy sky form the background and overhead scene, respectively.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly advances forward along the path, causing the immediate foreground to slowly recede and the more distant elements along the canal to incrementally approach the viewer. The reflections of the sky and clouds in the water also shift slightly, corresponding to this subtle forward camera movement.

The first frame displays a grassy path with faint tracks along the foreground left, bordered by a dense line of green bushes and a bare-branched tree further left. To the right, a murky canal with cloud reflections runs parallel, beyond which lies a green field featuring two distant conical brushwood piles and another bare tree on the far right, all under a cloudy sky.
end of description
The following frames depict the viewer moving forward along the path, causing the canal, bushes, and distant field to steadily advance *towards* and then past the original first-frame viewpoint. The scene continuously unfolds *ahead* as the camera progresses, with no new objects or scenes appearing from outside the initial view.
