A large framed painting of a dark-skinned woman with short hair, hoop earrings, and red lips against a green and orange patterned background fills the center and right of the first frame. To its left, a gold-framed round mirror reflects a distant room, while a woven basket is partially visible in the upper right.

Subsequent frames reveal a slow zoom out and downward pan, extending the painting to show the woman's yellow, starburst-patterned shirt and the artist's signature 'Patrice B.' at the bottom right. Concurrently, the mirror's reflection to the left expands, displaying more of the room behind the viewer, including a console table with decorative objects.
