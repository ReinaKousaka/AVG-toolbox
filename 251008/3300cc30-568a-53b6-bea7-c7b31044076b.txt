In the first frame, a woman in a light blue top and grey scarf stands in the left foreground, looking towards the right, while a grey pillar and a shopfront with brickwork and windows line the left wall of a brightly lit, tiled corridor. Numerous pedestrians move away from the viewer in the midground and background along the curving corridor, including a prominent person in a red jacket pulling a small trolley, and another woman in a grey coat walking towards the viewer in the mid-right.

As the camera moves forward, the foreground woman exits the frame to the bottom-left, revealing more of the patterned floor. Concurrently, the person in the red jacket and the woman in the grey coat grow larger and closer to the viewer, while new sections of shops and displays become visible further down the corridor to the right.
