A wide wooden staircase with reddish-brown railings ascends into the frame's upper middle, flanked by dense green foliage on the left and sparser trees with a light background, possibly a body of water or sky, on the right. Several people are visible standing near the top of the visible stairs, with one person wearing a prominent yellow/orange jacket among them.
end of description
The viewer begins to move forward, ascending the wooden staircase. As the camera progresses upward, the individual steps and sections of the railings pass beneath and beside the viewpoint. The group of people initially at the top of the stairs appears closer and gradually moves lower within the frame as the viewer approaches their position along the path. The surrounding foliage on both sides dynamically shifts, but no entirely new scenes or objects from behind, to the left, or to the right of the first-frame viewpoint are revealed beyond the continuous ascent.
