The initial frame presents a vibrant flower bed with white, brown, green, purple, and orange plants in the foreground, bordering a wide blue lake populated by several boats. Across the lake, a city skyline with buildings and cranes is visible, backed by distant mountains, while a street signpost and a bridge with a red Ferris wheel stand to the mid-right.

As the sequence progresses, the camera subtly pans to the left, revealing an active water fountain further to the left in the lake from the initial view. A white swan also becomes more distinctly visible in the midground water as the scene shifts, while the people on the far bank show minor movements.
