The first frame depicts a steep, grassy mountain slope with numerous fallen dead trees and scattered upright green pine trees extending from the midground towards the left. In the background to the left, snow-capped mountains rise under a blue sky dotted with white clouds.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the dirt path on the right side of the slope. This motion subtly reveals more of the immediate foreground and shifts the entire scene incrementally to the left, causing the fallen trees, upright pines, and distant mountains to gradually drift further left and out of the right side of the frame.
