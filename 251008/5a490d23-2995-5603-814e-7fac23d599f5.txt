The first frame presents a wide view of a vibrant green field dominating the left and central midground, bordered by a gravel path to the far right. In the immediate foreground on the right, a person in a dark jacket and blue jeans holds a large red object. In the background, snow-capped mountains rise to the left, while a town with buildings is visible nestled against a forested hill in the center, with a blue and white paraglider airborne above it.

The person and the red object on the right move completely out of the frame, revealing more of the gravel path. Simultaneously, the blue and white paraglider in the background continues its descent towards the right, drawing closer to the town buildings. A second paraglider, featuring a red, white, and blue canopy, subsequently appears behind and slightly to the left of the first, with both steadily descending further into the background.
