In the first frame, a white desk lamp, a black table holding a wooden tray with two stacked mugs, a black French press, and a potted fern are visible in the foreground, slightly left of center. The midground features a large open bi-fold doorway on the left, revealing an outdoor patio and garden. To the right of center, a light-colored two-seater sofa sits on a green striped rug, accompanied by a small side table behind it and two wooden chairs to its right. A tall black metal shelving unit stands against the back wall, left of center, while a large window on the back wall, right of center, overlooks the garden and a hot tub. Two distinct light fixtures hang from the ceiling above.

Following the first frame, a large, dark rectangular screen slides into view from the far left, progressively covering the outdoor view. Simultaneously, the bi-fold doors on the left side of the room begin to close from right to left, gradually enclosing the open space. By the final frame, the screen is prominently positioned to the left of the viewer, and the doors are significantly closed, obscuring much of the patio and garden previously visible outside.
