The first frame shows a street scene with a light pole covered in posters in the immediate foreground to the left. A red and white fire truck, partially visible from its front-left, is on the road in the midground, moving away from the viewer towards the left. Across the street on the right are storefronts with red umbrellas and black awnings, featuring businesses like "FABBRICA" and "OYSTERS," with people seated outside. Multi-story buildings and trees line the background, and a "Kent St" sign is visible on the upper right.
end of description
The fire truck, initially partially visible on the far left, moves progressively across the frame from left to right, revealing its full length as a red and white tiller truck with "F.D. N.Y. TILLER TRUCK 106" on its front. It continues to drive down the street, passing further to the right relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The background buildings and storefronts remain stationary, with no other objects newly revealed.
