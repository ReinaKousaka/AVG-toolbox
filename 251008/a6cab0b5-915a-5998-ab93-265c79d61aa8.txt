The first frame depicts a rainy city street with a wet green sidewalk on the left, next to a building, and a brown sidewalk on the right, where a tree and utility pole stand. Several people holding umbrellas gather on the sidewalk near a large white outdoor umbrella, while a black car drives on the wet road to the right, with tall buildings visible in the background.

Throughout subsequent frames, the rain continues, making the street progressively wetter and more reflective. The black car on the road moves from the right towards the left, eventually exiting the scene, and a light-colored vehicle appears further in the background, also moving on the road towards the left. The individuals on the sidewalk mostly maintain their positions, with only minor shifts in posture, particularly from the person closest to the utility pole on the right.

The first frame displays a rainy urban street scene, with a green-painted path and a brown structure on the viewer's left foreground, contrasting with a wet brick sidewalk and black bollards on the right. In the midground, three individuals holding black umbrellas stand, two on the left side of a large white cantilever umbrella, and one to its right, all facing generally towards the street, with residential and commercial buildings visible in the background across the wet road.

The person on the far right gradually shuffles further right along the sidewalk, eventually exiting the frame from the viewer's right side. The person in the center sways slightly, and their umbrella occasionally shifts with the wind, while the person on the left remains largely stationary. Throughout the sequence, rain continues to fall, and a white car drives past from left to right in the midground street, followed by another darker vehicle.
