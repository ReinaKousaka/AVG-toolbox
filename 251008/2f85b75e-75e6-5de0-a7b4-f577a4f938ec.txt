The first frame shows a dark, overcast city street viewed from a low angle, likely from a vehicle. A black SUV is directly in front of the viewer, occupying the middle ground of the wet asphalt road. To the viewer's left, a large, reddish-brown building with multiple arches or buttresses lines a sidewalk, on which a streetlamp stands close to the viewer and a person in dark clothing walks further down. To the viewer's right, a construction site with white barriers, orange fencing, and scaffolding runs alongside a modern, dark-paneled building. In the far distance, several tall buildings, including a prominent skyscraper, are visible under the hazy sky, beyond other vehicles on the road.
end of description
The scene progressively brightens, revealing significantly more detail across the entire streetscape. The viewer's perspective subtly shifts forward, maintaining the black SUV directly in front. On the left sidewalk, the person in dark clothing continues walking past the streetlamp, while another person in a light shirt and shorts emerges from behind the streetlamp and walks across the frame. Further down the left sidewalk, more pedestrians become visible as the details of the reddish-brown building and the construction site on the right become clearer. The distant skyscrapers and other vehicles also appear more distinct against the brightening sky.

The first frame captures a city street scene looking forward, with a dark SUV ahead, its brake lights illuminated. To the left, a woman walks on a sidewalk alongside a large brown brick building, past a streetlamp, while on the right, construction barriers shield a building under renovation, with distant skyscrapers in the background.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly advances down the street, causing the streetlamp on the left to gradually exit the frame. Simultaneously, the woman on the sidewalk progresses further away, and the construction barriers on the right also shift slightly out of view, while the SUV ahead remains mostly stationary.

The first frame captures a city street scene looking forward, with a large, old brown stone building on the left and a fenced construction site on the right featuring visible equipment. Several pedestrians are on the left sidewalk, including a blonde woman in the immediate foreground, while a black SUV and a red bus are further down the street ahead, leading to other city buildings and a distant skyscraper.

end of description
Over the following frames, the blonde woman on the left walks past the viewer and out of frame. The two women on the left sidewalk continue moving forward, with one eventually sitting down by the building. The black SUV and red bus maintain their positions ahead on the street as the viewpoint slightly advances forward.

The first frame shows a city street extending forward with a black SUV and a blue bus receding in the distance. To the immediate left is a red brick building and a lamppost, while white construction barriers and a brown building line the right, with a skyscraper visible in the far background.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the lamppost on the left and the construction barriers on the right move towards and then out of the foreground frame, revealing more of the street and adjacent buildings. The black SUV and blue bus continue to recede further down the street, bringing previously distant parts of the city scene closer into view relative to the initial position.

First, the viewer looks down a city street with a brown brick building and a green pole on the left sidewalk, and construction barriers on the right. A tall light-colored skyscraper rises behind the left building, with a black car and a blue bus ahead on the road, and another slender skyscraper in the distant background. end of description. As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the street. The black car and blue bus recede further away from the viewer. The construction barriers on the right move out of frame to the right, revealing more of the brown building and a lamppost there. The green pole on the left also moves out of frame to the left, and a yellow taxi becomes visible behind the lead black car as the urban landscape scrolls closer to the viewer.

The first frame depicts a city street viewed from the middle of the road. To the immediate left, a sidewalk features a tall black light pole with a green circular sign, followed by a large light-colored building, parked cars along the curb, and a red "PARK" banner further down the street. In the distant center-background, a very tall, slender skyscraper pierces the overcast sky. On the right, a sidewalk with several green trees, a bus stop shelter, and multi-story brown brick buildings with various shopfronts line the street, where a blue bus is also visible in the midground.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the light pole on the left moves out of view, revealing a yellow curb marking and more parked cars further down the sidewalk. A woman walks towards and then past the viewer on the left sidewalk, while the blue bus ahead also moves slightly forward. On the right, the trees and bus stop shelter recede, exposing more of the shopfronts, including an "H&R BLOCK" sign. The entire street scene appears to shift closer towards the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a city street extends into the distance under an overcast sky. In the foreground, a grey asphalt road with white crosswalk lines stretches centrally, bordered by a yellow line on the left. To the left, a sidewalk features a tall building with blue awnings and a 'PARK' banner, a white SUV, other parked cars, a street sign, and a woman walking from left to right. To the right, a sidewalk hosts a bus stop shelter, a building with an "H&R Block" sign, a tree, and streetlights. Further down the street in the midground, cars, a blue bus, and pedestrians are visible, with green traffic lights at an intersection, while a tall, slender skyscraper is faintly visible in the background, slightly right of center.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly moves forward, causing the white crosswalk lines in the foreground to expand. The woman on the left sidewalk continues her movement across the frame towards the right, eventually exiting the initial left-side view. Concurrently, the traffic lights at the intersection ahead in the midground change from green to yellow. A grey car previously partially obscured behind the white SUV on the left side of the street becomes fully visible. Minor shifts occur in street signage and banners, indicating the slight forward progression of the scene relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
