In the first frame, the viewer looks across a city intersection dominated by a patterned crosswalk in the foreground. Slightly left of center, a black trash can is visible, and to its right, orange and white traffic barriers surround a red and white striped pole emitting a significant plume of steam. A black SUV is turning left in the mid-ground, while a yellow taxi is stopped to the right of the steam, and a white van is further right. Tall buildings with diverse architectural styles line both sides of the street, receding into the distance, and a central traffic light pole displays green street signs including "UNION SQUARE W" and "E 17 ST".

The black SUV on the left proceeds forward, continuing its left turn away from the viewer. Pedestrians emerge and cross from the left sidewalk towards the right, and from behind the yellow taxi, also moving right. A person in a pink head covering appears near the trash can, moving towards the right side of the frame. Simultaneously, a black car enters the frame from the far right, slowly driving left across the foreground as the yellow taxi slightly advances.

In the first frame, a street scene unfolds with a black trash can and a pole bearing yellow traffic lights and green street signs (Union Square W, E 17 St, One Way) on the foreground left. Orange and white traffic barrels and sawhorses block part of the street to the right of the pole, while a tall orange and white striped pipe emits white steam in the midground center. To the left, a yellow taxi cab is visible, with pedestrians scattered on sidewalks on both sides of the street; a black car is positioned on the crosswalk to the right, partially obscured by a white van behind it, all framed by dense city buildings.
end of description
The black car in the midground right drives forward across the crosswalk throughout the frames, progressively revealing the white van positioned behind it. Simultaneously, the yellow taxi on the midground left also advances forward, and pedestrians on the sidewalks and crosswalk continue their movement. The white steam from the central orange and white pipe fluctuates and dissipates upwards consistently.
