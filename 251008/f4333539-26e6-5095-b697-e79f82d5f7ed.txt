The first frame shows a paved road curving left into the distance, marked by double yellow lines on its left lane and a white line on its right shoulder. To the immediate right, a steep, rocky hill densely covered with green and brown vegetation rises, while a less vegetated rocky slope is visible further left beyond the road. A clear blue sky spans the top of the frame, showing some sun glare in the upper center.
end of description
The viewpoint moves forward, causing the immediate foreground of the road and the surrounding vegetation and rocky terrain on both sides to recede towards and beyond the first-frame viewpoint. The winding road ahead continuously reveals new sections of the arid, hilly landscape.
