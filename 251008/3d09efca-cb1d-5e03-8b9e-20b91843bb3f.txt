A dark asphalt road, marked with double solid yellow lines down its center and a solid white line along its right edge, extends forward from the viewer, curving gently into the distance. It is flanked on both sides by sparse green and dry vegetation leading up to towering reddish-brown rocky canyon walls, all beneath a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the road, the foreground pavement and roadside vegetation continuously shift towards and past, while new sections of the road and canyon ahead are progressively revealed. A green road sign on the right side of the road gradually comes into clearer view and approaches the viewer. Further along, a second green sign, displaying "RM 28," appears on the right side of the road and subsequently moves closer as the journey continues.
