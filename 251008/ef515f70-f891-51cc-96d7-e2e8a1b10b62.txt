The first frame presents a rainy urban street intersection with a wet asphalt road, featuring a white crosswalk to the right and a red bicycle lane in the center foreground. A multi-lane street extends left to right into the distance, flanked by trees and tall buildings adorned with diverse Korean signage. A green bus is visible on the far left of the street, while multiple cars are stopped or parked on the right side under an overcast sky.

Subsequently, the green bus on the far left of the street begins to move forward, progressively exiting the frame to the left. As the bus departs, a person holding an umbrella becomes visible on the far left sidewalk, emerging from where the bus was, walking further away from the viewer along the street.
