The first frame depicts an airport terminal with a man in a maroon shirt and glasses standing with a black rolling suitcase on the right, next to rows of grey seating and a large multi-panel screen displaying ads. To the left, a wide, grey-tiled hallway with white walls and various signs extends into the distance, under a ceiling with strip lighting.

The man and his suitcase move progressively right and forward from the viewer's initial perspective, exiting the frame by the fifth image. Concurrently, the large screen to the right continuously cycles through different advertisements or informational content. Gradually, more individuals become visible seated further back within the gate area to the right.
