Two large magnolia trees with abundant pink blossoms stand in the foreground, partially obscuring a modern building behind them. This building, with a blue-tinted glass facade reflecting bright sunlight, is positioned in the midground to the right. A distant mountain range is visible in the background to the far left, under a clear blue sky that fills the upper portion of the frame.
