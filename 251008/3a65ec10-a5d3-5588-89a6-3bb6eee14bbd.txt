The first frame displays a verdant forest scene. To the immediate right and extending into the midground, a dense mass of bright green ferns occupies a large portion of the view. On the left, a narrow, winding dirt path, featuring some visible rocks or roots, leads away from the viewer into the depths of the forest. Beyond the path and ferns, numerous trees with light green foliage and some moss-covered trunks rise, forming a dense canopy overhead with hints of bright sky visible through the leaves in the upper center and right.

The viewpoint slowly moves forward along the dirt path, causing the dense ferns on the right to become closer and then recede, revealing more of the path and deeper parts of the forest to the right and ahead. As the viewer progresses, the path ahead becomes increasingly visible and the trees in the midground and background subtly shift closer, indicating a steady movement deeper into the lush green woods.

The first frame displays a narrow dirt path curving from the bottom left into the midground, flanked by a dense mass of bright green ferns occupying the right foreground and midground. This path leads into a lush, verdant forest filled with numerous trees, some with moss-covered trunks, and thick undergrowth, all beneath a bright, diffused sky visible through the canopy at the top center.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly advances forward along the path, causing the immediate foreground elements to recede slightly. The dense ferns initially in the right foreground appear to shift further to the right and slightly behind the viewer's new immediate position, revealing more of the forest deeper ahead and to the right of the first-frame viewpoint. The path ahead and the trees further along it gradually become more defined, indicating a slow, forward progression through the unchanged, verdant environment.
