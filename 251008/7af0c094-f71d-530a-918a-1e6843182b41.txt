The first frame depicts a busy city street at dusk. Immediately in the bottom-left foreground, a bike rack with a black bicycle rests near a white pole and a pedestrian signal showing '20' and a 'PATH' sign. A prominent yellow-marked crosswalk stretches from the bottom center towards a large, illuminated glass-fronted building in the midground, bearing 'Westfield' and 'EATALY' signs. Numerous pedestrians occupy the crosswalk and sidewalks in front of the building, moving generally away from the viewer, while a person on a bicycle with a delivery bag is visible to the viewer's right on the street, also moving away. The background features a distant cityscape with tall buildings and streetlights, with traffic lights showing red to the mid-right.
end of description
In the following frames, the pedestrian signal to the left continuously counts down from '19' to '0', then displays a 'don't walk' hand symbol. Concurrently, pedestrians occupying the crosswalk move further away from the viewer, crossing the street towards the central building and dispersing into or beyond its entrance. The person on the bicycle on the street to the right continues cycling away from the viewer, eventually moving further right out of the immediate view. No new objects are revealed, but the dynamic scene reflects the movement of people and the changing pedestrian signal status.
