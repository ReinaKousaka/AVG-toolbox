As the frames advance, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the dark asphalt and its markings to recede towards the horizon while the towering red rock formations on both sides steadily draw closer and expand into view. The continuous rightward curve of the road guides the viewer deeper into the scenic valley, revealing more of the arid roadside vegetation. Additionally, a faint sun glare moves slightly in the upper right of the frame.
