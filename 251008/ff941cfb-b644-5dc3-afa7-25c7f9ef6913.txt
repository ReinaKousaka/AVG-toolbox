The first frame displays a wet city street at night, reflecting numerous lights. In the midground, a blue public bus with "601" displayed and its red taillights illuminated is angled away from the viewer, positioned centrally on the road. To the right of the bus is a street pole, and further right, a wet sidewalk with indistinct figures and trees. On the far left, a red traffic light is visible, and the background features illuminated multi-story buildings lining the street.

The blue bus continues moving left across the road, gradually exiting the frame. Subsequently, a blue car emerges behind the bus, proceeding leftward, followed by a white car entering from the right, moving in the same direction. Concurrently, a red fire hydrant becomes visible at the base of the street pole to the right, and the traffic light on the far left transitions from red to green.

In the first frame, a wet city street at night is visible from a low angle on the right-hand sidewalk. A red fire hydrant and an ornate dark lamppost stand in the immediate foreground to the right, adjacent to the reflective street with yellow and white markings. To the left, a blue car and a lighter-colored car are positioned on the street, with a blue bus further down to the right, and various lighted buildings and traffic signals (red on the right, green on the left) line both sides of the road.
end of description
The blue car and the lighter-colored car both begin to move forward on the wet street, away from the viewer, as the blue bus also proceeds further down the road. The initial green traffic light on the left side of the street dims and turns off, while the red traffic lights on the right remain illuminated. Subsequently, a pedestrian carrying a black umbrella emerges on the right-hand sidewalk, walking away from the viewer. More pedestrians with umbrellas become visible further down the right sidewalk, also moving away, as the rain persists, keeping the street highly reflective.

The first frame captures a rainy night city street with a decorated lamppost in the right foreground. On the wet asphalt street, a blue car on the left, a silver car in the center, and a person with an umbrella crossing from right to left in the midground are all moving away from the viewer, while city buildings and red traffic lights line the background.
end of description
As frames progress, the blue car exits left, the silver car moves further into the distance, and the person with the umbrella continues their crossing, shifting further away and left from their initial midground position. Rain consistently falls across the static scene, with no new elements revealed.
