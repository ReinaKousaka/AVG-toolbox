The first frame depicts a bustling outdoor Christmas market at dusk. In the immediate foreground, to the left, is a rustic wooden stall adorned with festive lights and a colorful crest, where a queue of people stands behind a metal barrier. To the right, part of another wooden stall with a conical roof and lights is visible. In the midground, a large crowd of people fills the square, interspersed with numerous market stalls decorated with lights, some featuring red figures like Santa. Dominating the background is a grand classical building with columns and windows, alongside modern glass structures, all beneath a dusky sky with a visible crane above.

Across the subsequent frames, the most noticeable change is the continuous forward movement of the queue of people in the left-midground, relative to the initial viewpoint. The man with glasses and a blue vest in the lower-left foreground slowly advances towards the left-side stall. Other individuals within the midground crowd also exhibit subtle shifts in position, maintaining the dynamic atmosphere of the market.
