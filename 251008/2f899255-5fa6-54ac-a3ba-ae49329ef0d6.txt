In the first frame, jagged dark grey rock formations with some green foliage are prominent in the foreground and midground, extending from the left to the center. On a rocky peak in the midground, slightly right of center, two people stand with their backs to the viewer, observing the expansive view. Behind them, lush green mountains rise majestically across the background, while to the far right, a body of water with a small coastal settlement is visible below the mountains.
end of description
The scene remains largely static, with the viewpoint fixed. In subsequent frames, the person on the left (wearing pink) gradually raises their right arm upwards. Shortly after, the person on the right (wearing blue) also raises their left arm. Both individuals then hold this pose, with arms extended, as if gesturing or celebrating the panoramic vista.
