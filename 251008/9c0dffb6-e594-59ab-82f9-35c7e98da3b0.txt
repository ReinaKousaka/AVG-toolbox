In the first frame, a rainy night street scene shows a person partially visible in the immediate foreground right, holding a blue umbrella and a Nike bag. Ahead, two individuals walk away from the viewer under black umbrellas on a wet sidewalk, flanked by storefronts on the left and a street with parked cars and streetlights on the right, all reflecting the rain.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the person closest to the viewer continues walking to the right and further away, revealing more of the wet patterned sidewalk directly in front. Simultaneously, the two people in the midground continue their walk down the street away from the viewer. Neon lighting from the storefronts on the left dynamically changes from green to blue, then to pink and purple, illuminating the wet pavement as the heavy rain persists.
