A wide asphalt area in the foreground leads to a broad set of stairs with metal handrails, ascending towards the middle ground. To the left, a stone-walled planter with flowers and small trees borders a building, while to the right, a road curves away. Atop the stairs, a patio with white umbrellas and a few people is visible against towering, snow-capped mountains in the background under a blue, cloudy sky.
end of description
A group of people, initially near the top right of the stairs in the middle ground, begins to descend the staircase in a line, moving from the middle ground towards the foreground on the viewer's right. They continue their orderly descent, appearing progressively lower on the stairs in subsequent frames.

In the first frame, a grand stone staircase with a central metal handrail ascends from the foreground, flanked by a lush, green and white flowered retaining wall on the left and a concrete structure on the right, which borders a paved road. At the top of the stairs, a person in a red jacket stands centrally, near a dark statue to their right, with another person visible further right. Majestic, snow-capped mountains dominate the background under a blue sky with scattered clouds, and distant buildings are visible to the far right.
end of description
A pair of people, one in a pink top and one in a dark jacket, descend the right side of the stairs, moving towards the viewer's right and gradually exiting the frame by frame 5. Simultaneously, from frame 6, a yellow bus laden with cargo emerges from the mid-right onto the paved road. This bus travels horizontally across the frame, moving towards the right and eventually leaving the scene by frame 9. The person in the red jacket at the top of the stairs subtly shifts their posture, turning slightly to their right throughout the sequence.
