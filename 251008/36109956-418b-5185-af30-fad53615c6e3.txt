The first frame shows a paved street extending into the distance, flanked by buildings on both sides under a clear blue sky with distant mountains. To the viewer's immediate right, a dark-haired man leans against a building's glass facade, partially obscuring a "TASTE OF INDIA RESTAURANT" sign, talking on a phone. On the left, a person walks away from the viewer on a sidewalk beside a multi-story yellow building with blue window shutters and ground-floor shops. Further down the street on the right sidewalk, two people walk towards the viewer.

The man on the immediate right moves slightly left, then exits the frame to the right. The two individuals on the right sidewalk continue walking closer towards the viewer. Simultaneously, the person on the left sidewalk proceeds further away down the street. As these movements occur, a new shopfront sign featuring scissors and a mustache, indicating a barber shop, becomes visible on the right side.
