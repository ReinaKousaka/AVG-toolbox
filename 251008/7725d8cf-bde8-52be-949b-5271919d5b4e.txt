The first frame shows a rainy city street at night. A wet asphalt road extends from the viewer's lower-left, curving slightly into the distance, with a yellow curb on its right edge near the viewer. To the viewer's right is a wet, tiled sidewalk, on which a person holding a light pink umbrella walks away from the viewer. A dark-trunked tree stands prominently in the mid-ground, slightly to the right of the center, rooted in the sidewalk's edge. Beyond the tree, on the wet road, a white SUV with visible red taillights is positioned in the mid-left, facing away from the viewer, with another white car parked behind it. Further down the street on both sides, buildings with brightly lit storefronts and other cars are visible under the dark, rainy sky.
end of description
The person with the umbrella on the right sidewalk walks further away from the viewer, eventually exiting the frame to the far right. Concurrently, the white SUV's brake lights in the mid-left flash brighter before dimming slightly, and its reverse lights briefly illuminate. A light blue car then emerges from the distant left, driving towards the viewer on the road and passing the stationary white SUV.
