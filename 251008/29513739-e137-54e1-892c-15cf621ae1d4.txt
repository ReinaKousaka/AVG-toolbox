The first frame displays a bedroom, featuring a dark countertop with two decorative jars and a framed picture on a shelf in the foreground left. Mid-left, a tiled wall partially reveals a fireplace, while to the mid-right, two armchairs face a large bed with white bedding and a dark throw blanket. A dark dresser topped with multiple square mirrors sits between two windows in the background, all beneath a wooden ceiling feature and an ornate chandelier.

As the camera pans right, the foreground countertop and its items move out of view, fully revealing the tiled fireplace on the left and a large artwork above it. Further panning exposes a new brown cabinet structure directly to the left of the fireplace and a wider section of the wall, including another window, as the bed and armchairs shift further right.
