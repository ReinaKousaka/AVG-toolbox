A turquoise river dominates the midground, flowing horizontally. Across the river, a vibrant row of multi-story buildings with various colored facades and balconies lines a paved road, where a black car and a person in red are visible. Behind the buildings, a large, tree-covered mountain with rocky sections rises steeply under an overcast sky. A stone railing partially frames the bottom left in the immediate foreground.

The camera slowly pans left, revealing more of the ornate stone railing and new hanging flower baskets with yellow and magenta blooms in the foreground, and extending the view of buildings to the far left. Simultaneously, the black car on the road moves slowly to the right, and a person walks along the street.
