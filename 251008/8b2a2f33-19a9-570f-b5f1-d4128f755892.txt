The first frame displays a cobblestone patio leading down a slight slope to the left, bordered by a dark green railing overlooking a green valley with distant hills. To the left foreground is a stone planter with withered plants, beside the railing. In the center-left stands a large, round green bush, with a dark green park bench situated directly behind it. To the right, a light brown building with a green-shuttered window and a green door is visible, along with a smaller potted plant near the building's base. A utility pole stands upright towards the upper right, with tall trees behind it.

The first frame shows an elevated cobblestone-paved outdoor area with a scenic vista. In the foreground, the grey cobblestone ground covers the bottom, leading to a dark green metal bench positioned slightly left of center. To the far left, a large, dense dark green bush is visible, partially obscuring a black metal railing that extends across the mid-ground, marking the edge of the elevated area. Beyond the railing, a vast mountainous landscape with trees stretches into the misty distance under a partly cloudy sky. To the right of the bench stands a utility pole, surrounded by evergreen trees, while a light brown building occupies the right side, featuring a green-framed window, green shutters, and a small green door. A potted plant sits on a stone structure against the building wall.

The subsequent frames show a gradual increase in sunlight, making the entire scene progressively brighter. The distant mountainous landscape becomes slightly clearer, and the sky in the left background shifts from partly cloudy to a more prominent blue with fewer visible clouds.
