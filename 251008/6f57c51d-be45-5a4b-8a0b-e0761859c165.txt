The viewer is positioned on a wet city sidewalk under a dark umbrella (visible at the top), with heavy rain falling across the scene at night. A black and white scooter is parked immediately to the viewer's left. Ahead, three tree trunks separate the sidewalk from the wet road, where a gray SUV is parked to the left and a dark SUV with blinking hazard lights is further right; a red fire hydrant stands between the middle and right trees. Across the road, buildings with numerous colorful, illuminated signs line the background, and other cars are visible under streetlights.
end of description
Heavy rain persists throughout the sequence. A person subsequently emerges from behind the dark SUV on the road's right side, bending down near the vehicle. A yellow and black scooter then travels from the far left side of the road, passing the gray SUV and moving towards the background.
