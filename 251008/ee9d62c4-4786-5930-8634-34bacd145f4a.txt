The first frame presents a wet, uphill paved road on the left, leading towards a multi-story hotel building with "HOTEL" signs, green shutters, and wooden balconies. To the right of the hotel, a large tree with reddish-brown autumn leaves shades an outdoor patio with yellow awnings, situated above a stone wall and hedge. Further right, a wet sidewalk extends into the distance, where two men walk away from the viewer past traditional buildings adorned with Swiss flags and bear flags, with several parked cars alongside the street. In the background, a mist-shrouded green mountain looms under an overcast sky.

The camera slowly pans to the right, causing the "HOTEL" building to shift further left and revealing more of the street, additional buildings, and parked cars that were initially on the far right of the first frame. The mountain in the background becomes more centered, and the two men continue walking away from the viewer along the sidewalk, moving further into the scene that is now revealed to the right.
