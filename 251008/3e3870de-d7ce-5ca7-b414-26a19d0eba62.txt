An elevated view shows a wide, dry, grassy ditch flanked by ancient stone walls running from the foreground towards the middle distance. To the left, behind the wall, lies a port with boats and a parking lot, backed by a massive stone fortress with an archway and distant castle structures on a hill. To the right, another section of the port with more boats and rocky shore is visible, leading to a modern city skyline. A clear blue sky occupies the upper portion, and text "RHODES CITY MANDRAKI Port" is in the lower right.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily ascends and slightly pulls back throughout the frames, revealing more of the ancient stone structures and their depth. As the camera rises, new internal architectural features, like staircases and lower-level passages within the left fortress wall, become visible. This movement offers an increasingly expansive view of the central grassy area, the detailed construction of the flanking stone walls, and a wider panoramic perspective of the port and the sprawling city beyond.
