The first frame depicts a bustling outdoor gathering on a sunny day. In the foreground, a diverse group of adults and children are positioned from left to right, mostly facing towards a display area under a light-colored tent canopy. To the far left, a man in a green cap stands beside a woman in a tan jacket and a small child in a pink outfit. Several other individuals are gathered around the booth's front, including one person in a plaid shirt kneeling in the mid-right foreground, with a child in a blue jacket visible at the far right. Beyond the attendees, a grassy park slopes towards a body of water, with a cityscape and cloudy sky filling the background.

Following the first frame, the woman in the yellow vest to the right continues to adjust items on the display table, moving her hands and a white object. The person in the plaid shirt in the mid-right foreground further crouches down and then gradually stands up slightly, turning their head more to the left. The small child in the blue jacket at the far right foreground also turns their head further towards the left, observing the activity. No entirely new objects or scenes are revealed.
