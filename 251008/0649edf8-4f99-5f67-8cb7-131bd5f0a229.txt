The first frame displays a nighttime urban street scene with a building on the left featuring an illuminated red menu and a potted plant below. A person in a white coat stands left, adjusting their hair near the building wall, while another person in a dark coat stands slightly to their right, beside a "Jule Pizza" A-frame sign. Further down the snowy sidewalk, several pedestrians walk away from the viewer towards a busy street in the background, with part of a person's back visible in the extreme foreground right.

Throughout the following frames, the person in the white coat consistently adjusts their hair by the building. The person in the dark coat subtly shifts their posture and hand position, while the pedestrians in the midground continue walking further away from the first-frame viewpoint along the sidewalk.
