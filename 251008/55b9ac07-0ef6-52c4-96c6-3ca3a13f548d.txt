The first frame depicts a bus stop shelter on the left, featuring a blue roof, orange trim, glass panels, and a red flower-like decoration on its front left post. To the left of the shelter is a wet road with a white line, while to its right is a wet sidewalk bordered by green trees and bushes; a person holding an umbrella is visible further down this path.

As the frames progress, the camera subtly pans right and moves slightly forward. This movement gradually reveals more of the bus stop's glass interior, including a bench, while the leading edge of the shelter moves further to the viewer's left. Concurrently, the person with the umbrella, initially visible down the path to the right, continues walking away from the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame displays a rainy urban scene. To the viewer's immediate left, part of a bus stop shelter with a green-tinted glass panel is visible. A wet paved road extends from the left middle ground into the distance, separated by a railing from a further tree-lined area. A wet sidewalk runs parallel to the road on the right, bordered by a line of trees and a low hedge along a stone wall to the far right. In the mid-distance on this path, a person holding an umbrella stands near a small stool or bench, facing away from the viewer.

A hand briefly appears near the top-left of the bus stop glass, revealing a '98' sign on the structure. Subsequently, the bus stop begins to recede from the left side of the frame as the person under the umbrella slowly walks further down the wet path, moving away from the viewer. The continuous rainfall remains a prominent dynamic across all frames.

In the first frame, a wet sidewalk extends from the foreground into the distance, with a grey paved section on the left and a greenish path on the right. To the left of the sidewalk, a rain-soaked road stretches away from the viewer. A person holding an open black umbrella walks away from the viewer on the green path, positioned in the midground. Several trees with green foliage line both sides of the path, extending into the background, while a dense green hedge runs along the far right side. Heavy rain is visible across the entire scene.
end of description
The person with the umbrella continuously walks further away from the viewer along the green path, moving deeper into the scene's background. Their distance from the viewer increases progressively in each subsequent frame as they proceed down the rainy walkway. The heavy rain continues without abatement throughout the entire sequence.
