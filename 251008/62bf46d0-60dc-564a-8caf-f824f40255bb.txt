First frame shows a vibrant green meadow with yellow flowers in the foreground. In the midground, a cluster of traditional wooden houses with brown roofs, some partially snow-covered, is nestled among a bare tree, with a rustic wooden barn visible on the right. Dominating the background are majestic, snow-capped mountains under a clear blue sky.
