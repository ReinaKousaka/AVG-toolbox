The first frame displays an aerial view centered on a large, U-shaped red-brick building with a distinct light green pitched roof and numerous dormer windows, occupying the central-right portion of the image. To the building's left, a road with visible vehicles, parking spaces, and a crosswalk runs vertically, bordered by trees and green spaces. Further behind the main building and to its upper right, more campus grounds, pathways, and parts of other buildings, including a large domed structure, are visible.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the camera slowly moves upwards and subtly zooms out, causing the primary building to recede slightly and appear smaller relative to the overall frame. This camera movement gradually reveals more of the surrounding campus grounds, particularly additional pathways and greenery directly below the main building, and extends the visible area further to the left of the road from the initial viewpoint.
