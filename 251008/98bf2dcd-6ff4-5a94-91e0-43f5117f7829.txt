The first frame displays a nighttime outdoor scene, with a paved walkway extending into the distance, flanked on both sides by archways covered in bright string lights. In the foreground to the left, a group of people, mostly viewed from behind, are standing still. To the right in the foreground, a man in a green jacket and a red, white, and blue hat also stands facing away from the viewer, while other individuals populate the midground leading towards a large, brightly illuminated archway in the far background.

As the frames progress, the man in the green jacket on the right begins to walk forward along the path, moving further away from the viewer. The group of people on the left remains largely stationary, while other distant figures continue their movement along the illuminated walkway.

The first frame depicts a paved pathway illuminated by two archways of warm white string lights stretching into the distance on both sides. In the immediate foreground to the left, a man in a dark jacket stands with his back to the viewer, partially obscuring a woman in a green puffer jacket who is bending forward. In the midground to the right, a man wearing a khaki jacket and a red beanie walks away from the viewer, while a crowd of people is gathered further down the path, leading towards a large, brightly lit archway in the background against a dark sky.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the man in the khaki jacket progressively walks further away from the viewer down the path. Concurrently, the woman in the green puffer jacket in the foreground bends lower and appears to reach forward, her position continuously changing. The group of people in the midground ahead of the viewer subtly shifts and disperses slightly, revealing more of the pathway and the distant illuminated archway as the scene progresses.

The first frame shows a paved walkway extending into the distance, flanked by archways covered in bright fairy lights. A partial view of a person is in the lower left foreground. In the midground, a person in a green jacket and red beanie walks away from the viewer, surrounded by a crowd of people. Further back, a large, glowing white arch is visible, with dark trees and distant lit buildings on either side.
end of description
The person in the green jacket continues walking away from the viewer along the illuminated path. Several other individuals, initially visible in the midground, shift their positions or walk further into the background. As the initial person progresses, another person in a dark coat and hat becomes more prominent behind and to their left, also moving forward relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The crowd in the midground and background slowly dissipates as people move further away.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures a paved pathway extending towards a brightly lit archway in the distant background, flanked by towering arches of white string lights in the immediate foreground. Numerous individuals are visible in the midground, walking along the path or standing, with trees and city buildings dimly lit behind them on the left and a white structure on the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, a woman in a tan jacket and dark scarf carrying a black bag emerges from just behind the left foreground arch, walking diagonally across the mid-left path towards the viewer's right. A man in a blue jacket follows closely behind her from the same starting position, moving further across the path as other figures in the midground continue their slow progression into the distance.

The first frame presents a bustling night scene on a paved pedestrian walkway, flanked by festive lights. To the far left, a person in a yellow jacket and black pants walks towards the viewer, partially obscuring another individual behind them. In the mid-foreground right, a person in a dark winter coat with a fur hood stands facing away from the viewer, looking down the path. The path leads towards a brightly lit, arch-shaped structure centrally positioned in the midground, with numerous pedestrians gathered around it. To the right, a white display stand featuring an "NIO" logo, adorned with lights and a silver car, is visible. In the background on the left, multi-story buildings with illuminated windows line a street with visible traffic, while to the far right, a large Ferris wheel-like structure glows with blue lights.

end of description

The person in the yellow jacket on the far left continues walking forward relative to the initial viewpoint, gradually revealing more of the person previously behind them. A new pedestrian in a white coat emerges from the left background and moves towards the right side of the frame, traversing the mid-left area. Other individuals scattered throughout the midground and background subtly shift their positions, maintaining the busy atmosphere as people continue to walk towards or gather around the central archway.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a cobblestone path extends towards a brightly lit, arched tunnel in the midground. Several people occupy the foreground and midground: a woman in a black puffer coat stands centrally, facing away, while to her right, another woman in a white beanie and a man with a camera tripod are present. To the far left, a man and woman in winter coats walk towards the viewer. On the left side, multi-story buildings line a street with traffic and pedestrians, while to the right, a white booth with a "NIO" logo, adorned with lights, houses a silver car and an information display. A large, lit Ferris wheel is partially visible in the far upper right background.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective slightly moves forward and upward. The central woman in the black puffer coat, the woman in the white beanie, and the man with the tripod all gradually recede further away from the viewer. Concurrently, the couple on the far left walks closer towards the viewer, eventually passing the initial central foreground position.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the foreground, from left to right, are parts of a person with a cream scarf, a person in a fur-hooded jacket seen from behind, a woman in a black puffer jacket holding a phone and cup, and a man in a green jacket holding a tripod. The midground features a prominent, brightly lit archway flanked by trees and numerous pedestrians, with a 'NIO' branded white canopy displaying a car on the right, and illuminated city buildings with more people and traffic on the left. In the far background, faint blue lights from a Ferris wheel are visible above the canopy on the right.

end of description

The foreground pedestrians, including the person in the fur-hooded jacket, the woman in the black puffer, and the man with the tripod, all move forward, with the latter also shifting further to the viewer's right. Concurrently, several pedestrians in the midground traverse the scene, notably a person in a dark jacket with white sneakers walks from the right midground towards the viewer's left. By the final frames, the man with the tripod has advanced significantly closer and to the viewer's right, turning his gaze towards the camera. The woman in the black puffer jacket moves mostly out of frame to the viewer's left, as the general crowd in the midground and background subtly shifts and disperses.
