The first frame depicts a wet autumn street lined with traditional Korean buildings and vibrant yellow ginkgo trees. A large ginkgo tree trunk fills the foreground right, while a utility pole with a 'Tow Away Zone' sign stands mid-center, and a dark grey sedan with glowing taillights drives away in the midground left. end of description. In subsequent frames, the dark grey sedan slowly advances further down the street, as a silver taxi enters the scene from the lower left. This taxi then proceeds past the viewer along the street, progressively revealing its 'TAXI' sign on the roof as it moves into the midground left.
