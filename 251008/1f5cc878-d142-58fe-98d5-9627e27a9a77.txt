A cracked paved road with reddish dirt on the left foreground leads towards an old two-story building in the mid-ground, which has a dark doorway and is partially obscured by dense green foliage on the left. To the right, the road curves, bordered by a dark hedge and revealing distant trees and a bright, cloudy sky beyond.

As the viewer progresses forward and slightly right, the building on the left recedes, revealing its stone base and an extensive stack of firewood along its newly visible side, which was previously hidden behind the building from the first-frame perspective. The dense foliage on the left also recedes, and the winding road continues to open up towards the right and ahead, revealing more of the sky and distant mountainous landscape in the background.
