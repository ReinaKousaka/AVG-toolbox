The first frame displays a panoramic view of a mountain village under a clear blue sky. In the immediate foreground, a lush green grassy slope occupies the bottom left, while a paved path with a wooden fence runs along the bottom right. A white church with a tall, dark spire stands prominently in the mid-ground on the right, partially obscured by a large green tree, with two figures walking away from the viewer on the path beside it. To the left, several houses are scattered across the green slopes, including a large light-colored building and a smaller reddish-brown house. Behind the village, dense green forests cover rolling hills, leading to majestic, snow-capped mountains spanning the horizon from the center to the far left.
end of description
Initially, two figures walk away on the path to the right, gradually exiting the frame. The camera then slowly pans left, revealing more of the large building situated to the left of the original viewpoint. As the pan continues, a new, taller multi-story building emerges further to the left of the initial scene. Concurrently, the church on the right shifts closer to the right edge of the frame, and more of the distant snow-capped mountain range becomes visible on the far left of the expanded vista.
