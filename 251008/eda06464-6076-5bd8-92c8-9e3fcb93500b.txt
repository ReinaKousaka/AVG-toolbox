frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame shows train tracks receding into the distance, centered in the lower half of the view. To the viewer's left, a large deciduous tree stands prominently in the mid-ground, with a small building further back and a wet road running parallel to the tracks, then curving to the left. A valley landscape and distant mountains are visible further left under a pale sky. To the viewer's right, a grassy area with bushes leads up to a densely forested mountain slope that dominates the right background. A utility pole with overhead wires and a small wooden shed are visible in the mid-ground to the right, while a level crossing with various signs appears directly ahead in the distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, it approaches and then passes a level crossing. A signal on the left begins flashing yellow as the train nears. The red and white striped barrier on the right descends across the road, and a white crossbuck sign and a signal on the left are passed as the train moves over the crossing. The road then curves sharply away to the left, and the forested mountain on the right becomes more prominent as the tracks gently curve towards the right from the initial forward direction.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows train tracks curving right into the distance, flanked by a grey road and dense vegetation on the left, and a grassy field with a fence, scattered trees, and a grey utility box in the right foreground, all set against a steep, dark, forested mountain slope dominating the background; catenary lines with a supporting pole are visible overhead on the right, and distant mountains peek through a light sky at the upper left, with "Vmax: 100kmh" displayed at the bottom left.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the utility box on the right recedes and moves out of frame, while a new pole with black and white markings emerges on the left, advancing closer to the viewer. This marked pole then passes out of view to the left. Simultaneously, additional catenary poles emerge further along the tracks on the right, and the entire scene of the curving tracks, mountain, and valley continuously shifts closer, indicating forward motion.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
From a forward-facing viewpoint on a railway, tracks curve slightly right into the distance. To the immediate left, a wet asphalt road parallels the tracks, separated by a sparse fence, with green foliage and a tree beyond it, leading to a distant mountain face. To the right, a grassy embankment with a fence and dense trees covers a steep mountain slope. An overhead power line structure stands slightly right of center over the tracks, which appear to lead into a distant tunnel entrance nestled at the base of the mountain. "Vmax: 100km/h" is displayed in the bottom left.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily advances along the railway tracks as they curve more sharply to the right, with the distant tunnel entrance ahead progressively coming into view. The parallel road and foreground trees on the left move from left to right relative to the first-frame center. Simultaneously, the grassy slope, trees, and mountain on the right shift towards the left of the initial frame. The initial power line pole passes the viewer, moving to the left, and a subsequent pole emerges further down the track.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a train's forward view along central railway tracks leading to a distant dark tunnel, flanked by a paved road and trees on the left, and a grassy slope ascending to a tree-covered mountain face with a utility pole on the right.
end of description
As the frames advance, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the utility pole on the right to pass and exit to the right of the first-frame viewpoint. The distant tunnel continuously approaches the viewer's initial position, growing larger as the train moves along the tracks. The surrounding mountainsides to both the left and right also progressively move past the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a train track extending into the distance towards a dark tunnel entrance directly ahead. To the right, a steep, rocky, tree-covered mountain face rises, featuring an electrical pole and overhead lines in the mid-ground. To the left, a paved road parallels the tracks, separated by a fence, beyond which lie more trees, a river, and distant mountains under a light sky; a "Vmax: 100kmh" text is displayed in the bottom-left foreground.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, causing the tunnel entrance ahead to steadily approach from its initial distant position. The electrical pole, initially in the mid-ground on the right, passes by the viewer's immediate right, while new sections of the rocky mountain face to the right and the road and fence to the left continuously reveal themselves as they move from the distance towards and past the viewer's perspective.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays railway tracks leading from the viewer into the mid-distance towards a dark tunnel entrance, flanked by a paved road and a tree-covered mountain on the left, and a rocky mountain face on the right; "Vmax: 100km/h" is displayed at the bottom left. end of description. As the camera advances, the tunnel approaches, and previously unseen overhead line masts with wires emerge from the right mid-distance, moving past the viewer alongside the tracks. The continuous forward motion causes the entire landscape to shift past, receding behind the viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a view down a set of train tracks extending into the distant center. To the right, a large, dark, wet rocky cliff face runs parallel to the tracks, with a tunnel entrance visible further down the tracks nestled at its base. To the left, an asphalt road runs parallel to the tracks, bordered by dense green trees and a distant mountain peak under a bright sky. A small "Vmax: 100kmh" text is in the bottom left corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the train tracks. The tunnel entrance, initially in the distant center, progressively nears. Simultaneously, a light-colored catenary pole emerges to the left of the tracks, then a yellow triangular sign attached to it, both moving closer relative to the first-frame viewpoint before receding behind the viewer. The rocky cliff face on the right and the road and trees on the left also continuously recede as the perspective advances towards the tunnel.
