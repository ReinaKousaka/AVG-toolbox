The first frame displays a street scene at dusk. In the foreground, an asphalt road with white arrows and Japanese characters, along with a manhole cover, extends directly away from the viewer. To the left, a sidewalk with a green railing runs parallel, bordered by buildings and utility poles with overhead wires, including a red circular and a green rectangular sign attached to a pole. In the midground, a white van with illuminated headlights is positioned centrally on the road, approaching the viewer, with other distant vehicles behind it. To the right, a light-colored building features a dark-tiled section and a lit sign near its entrance. The sky above is a dark blue-grey.
end of description
The white van, initially in the distant midground on the road, steadily approaches the viewer in subsequent frames. Its headlights become brighter and more distinct as it draws nearer to the first-frame viewpoint. The van then passes the viewer, moving from the central road to the left foreground, before receding out of view on the left side of the frame.

In the first frame, a white and purple van with illuminated headlights occupies the right foreground, moving left and partially obscuring a dark wall and building behind it. To the left, a sidewalk features several pedestrians alongside illuminated multi-story buildings, while the street extends into the distance where other vehicles' taillights are visible under a twilight sky filled with utility wires.
end of description
As the van continues to move left and exits the frame, it fully reveals the dark stone-textured wall and a modern light-colored building on the right side of the street, previously hidden. Concurrently, new road markings, including a bicycle symbol, become clearer in the foreground, and pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue walking further towards the viewer.

The first frame displays an urban street scene at dusk, with the viewer situated on a dark asphalt road containing white arrows, a diamond, and a bicycle symbol, looking straight ahead down a narrow thoroughfare. To the left, a sidewalk with a green railing runs alongside buildings featuring illuminated storefronts, where a person in a dark shirt and white mask walks towards the viewer. On the right, a multi-story building with a dark textured wall and warmly lit sections lines the street, with vehicle headlights visible in the distant midground and utility poles extending into the twilight sky.
end of description
The person on the left sidewalk moves towards the viewer and then exits the frame to the viewer's immediate left. Subsequently, another person in a white shirt appears on the left sidewalk, approaching the viewer and then stepping into a brightly lit doorway on the left. Concurrently, the distant vehicle headlights move slightly closer towards the viewer's static viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a city street at twilight, looking down a road flanked by multi-story buildings. A green railing runs along the left sidewalk where a brightly lit "Kartell" store and a pedestrian near a yellow school sign are visible, while the right features a building with a "MACQUA" sign and a utility pole. In the mid-ground, a white car with headlights and another vehicle's red taillights are present.
end of description.
Over subsequent frames, the white car and the red-lighted vehicle advance further away from the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, a pedestrian walks from the mid-ground left sidewalk towards and past the viewer, while a red "Kartell" sign and a potted plant become visible on the left and right sidewalks, respectively, in positions closer to the viewer than the initial scene's objects.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a narrow city street at dusk, viewed from a low angle. To the immediate left is a green railing, beyond which a building with illuminated windows and a prominent 'Kartell' sign is visible. The asphalt road, marked with white arrows and a pedestrian/bicycle symbol, stretches directly in front of the viewer into the distance. In the midground, a white car with headlights on is positioned to the right side of the road, and further ahead of it, a red vehicle with red lights is faintly visible. To the right, a utility pole adorned with signs stands near another building, while power lines crisscross the darkening sky above.
end of description
A white car, initially in the midground to the viewer's right, begins to move forward, receding away from the first-frame viewpoint. Over subsequent frames, it steadily progresses down the narrow street, revealing more of the road behind its initial position. The red vehicle, originally positioned further ahead, also continues to move away from the viewer's initial perspective. By the final frame, the white car has moved considerably further into the distance, almost exiting the scene, appearing much smaller from the original viewpoint.
