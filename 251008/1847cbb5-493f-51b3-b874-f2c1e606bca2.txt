The first frame presents a multi-story building, likely a cable car station, in the midground, featuring a wooden top, concrete base, yellow-framed windows, flower boxes, and a large mural with "GRINDELWALD FIRST" branding. A person in a grey jacket walks left on a concrete path with a metal handrail in the foreground, while a towering, snow-capped mountain range fills the background to the right.

The person on the path continues walking left, eventually moving out of frame beyond the left edge of the building. The viewpoint gradually shifts slightly to the right and subtly zooms out, revealing more of the ground level to the right of the main building. By the final frames, several new people become visible gathered on the path to the far right, further back behind the initial railing and near other buildings.
