The first frame shows a view overlooking a green canal flanked by traditional Chinese buildings with white walls and dark tiled roofs. To the left, a stone staircase leads upwards and away from the viewer, where a woman in a white shirt and green pants walks, followed by a person in a purple shirt with a yellow backpack. A covered wooden walkway with red lanterns extends along the left, while another walkway with red lanterns borders the canal on the right, above a stone wall with greenery. The background features more multi-story white buildings extending along the canal under an overcast sky.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the woman in the white shirt and the person in the purple shirt continue walking further away from the viewer, ascending the stone steps to the left and receding into the covered wooden walkway. Other indistinct figures also move further into the distance along the walkway on the left. No new objects or scenes are revealed as the camera remains stationary.

First, a stone path under a covered, lantern-adorned walkway occupies the left foreground, with a person walking away from the viewer. A green canal stretches from the viewer's immediate right foreground into the background, bordered by traditional white-walled buildings with dark roofs on both sides and another covered structure with lanterns over the water to the right.

As the viewpoint advances forward, the stone railing on the left foreground moves past the viewer, revealing more of the covered walkway and its seated occupants. A multi-tiered stone lantern, previously obscured by the railing, emerges from the canal, now situated more centrally ahead of the viewer, while the initial walking person moves further away and eventually exits the frame to the left. The scene continuously unfolds, revealing new segments of the canal and the traditional architecture lining its banks further ahead.

In the first frame, a traditional Chinese waterside scene is depicted. To the viewer's immediate left, a stone ledge with an ornate wooden railing runs horizontally. A large wooden pillar stands prominently in the mid-left, supporting an overhead structure from which several red, fish-shaped lanterns hang. A person in a yellow top is seated on the ledge to the far left. A greenish canal flows from the center towards the foreground right. Across the canal, a series of traditional buildings with white walls, dark tiled roofs, and wooden elements line the water, adorned with numerous red lanterns under their eaves. A small, multi-tiered stone lantern or sculpture is centered in the canal. On the far right bank, another structure with a dark roof and red lanterns is visible, framed by lush greenery. The background features more buildings under a cloudy sky.

The camera slowly pans to the right, causing the prominent wooden pillar on the left to move towards the frame's center, revealing more of the intricate wooden railing and additional red lanterns above. The small stone lantern in the canal also shifts slightly right. The traditional buildings across the canal become more fully visible, extending further to the right, while the building initially on the far right gradually moves out of the frame.
