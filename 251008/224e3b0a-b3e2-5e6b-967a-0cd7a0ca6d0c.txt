The first frame presents an aerial, composite view of an urban landscape, centered on a large, ribbed building with a flat roof. To its left, semi-transparent skyscrapers are visible, while a ghosted figure stands on the central building's roof, amidst other city structures like a green-domed building (bottom left) and a glass-roofed structure (bottom right).

Subsequent frames show the scene resolving into a clear aerial view, with the transparent overlays fading away. The ghosted figure on the central building's roof vanishes, and the previously semi-transparent left-side skyscrapers become solid and distinct. Concurrently, "The Wallbrook" emerges in the bottom right, and "#HighRiseViews" appears in the bottom left.
