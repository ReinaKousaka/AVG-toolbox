A paved road curves gently right through a lush green valley. To the left, a wooden fence borders the road, behind which a brown house with a red roof is nestled among trees, with forested hills in the distant background. To the right, a grassy slope with wildflowers ascends.

The viewpoint advances forward along the road, causing the house on the left to enlarge. As it moves, a gravel driveway leading to the house and a drain grate on the left side of the road become newly visible near the house's entrance. A rope barrier extending from the house towards the now receding fence line also appears.
