In the first frame, the viewer observes a wet city street at night, with white crosswalk stripes directly in the foreground. A prominent green traffic light is suspended ahead, its vibrant reflection illuminating the asphalt, while a white car with hazard lights is visible to the left and illuminated buildings line the street to the right. end of description The green traffic light ahead subtly dims and brightens across the frames, causing its reflection on the wet road to fluctuate. Simultaneously, a red light reflection appears and disappears to the right of the green one in the mid-distance, and the white car on the left moves slightly forward.

The first frame presents a nighttime view of a wet city street looking forward. The dark, reflective asphalt road with white crosswalk markings dominates the foreground, extending into the midground where a prominent green traffic light hangs centrally. On both sides, sidewalks are visible with streetlights, parked vehicles to the left, and buildings with illuminated signs to the right, extending into a hazy background cityscape.

As the frames progress, the central overhead traffic light changes from green to red. This transition is vividly reflected on the wet road surface below, where the strong green reflection diminishes and is replaced by an intensifying red glow, while the overall street perspective remains unchanged relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame displays a nighttime city street, wet from rain and highly reflective. In the foreground, the asphalt road mirrors vibrant green and red traffic lights and white streetlights, with prominent red and white road markings. To the left, a street lined with buildings, parked cars, and numerous streetlights recedes into the misty distance. Directly ahead and to the right, tall illuminated buildings flank a road with orange and white barriers, while a green traffic light hangs centrally and another appears on the right.

There are no dynamic changes or newly revealed objects across the subsequent frames; all visible elements, including lights and street conditions, remain static relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
