The first frame captures a rainy city street at night, featuring a prominent lamppost and a pile of white trash bags in the foreground, slightly to the right. A wet road on the left reflects various streetlights and building signs, while a pedestrian with an umbrella walks away on the right-side sidewalk, where potted trees and utility boxes are visible.

Across subsequent frames, the main traffic light on the left side of the street changes from red to green, while a more distant one on the right transitions from green to red. A new pedestrian holding an umbrella appears from behind the foreground lamppost, crossing the street towards the right as the distant pedestrian continues walking away. Vehicle headlights subtly shift in the distance, indicating ongoing traffic and continuous rainfall.

The first frame depicts a rainy night cityscape with wet streets reflecting traffic lights and building illuminations. In the foreground, white trash bags rest beside two utility boxes and a tree trunk, while the street stretches into the distance, lined by buildings, distant pedestrians, and vehicles with headlights.

A white car drives from the far right background, across the street to the left, and out of frame. Subsequently, another white car appears from the far right background, also traversing the distant street towards the left. Concurrently, a person holding a red umbrella on the far left of the street slowly moves leftward.

In the first frame, two light grey utility boxes occupy the foreground to the viewer's left, with the closest one appearing slightly damaged. Behind them and slightly right of center, a tree trunk stands. To the left background, a city street features illuminated buildings, commercial signs, traffic lights showing red, and a pedestrian with a red umbrella. To the right background, a wet, multi-lane road reflects vehicle headlights moving away, under green traffic lights, flanked by buildings and streetlights.
end of description
The camera slowly pans right, causing the two foreground utility boxes to move out of frame to the viewer's left. The tree trunk, initially in the mid-ground, progressively shifts left, revealing more of the wet, reflective street and additional oncoming traffic to the right of its original position. A white car then enters the frame from the far right, driving towards the viewer on the previously obscured street, passing behind the expanding view to the tree's right.
