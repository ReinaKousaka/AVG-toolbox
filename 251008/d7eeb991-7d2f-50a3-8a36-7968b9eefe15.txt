In the first frame, a bustling city street is visible, with a multi-story white building to the left and taller reddish-brown buildings to the right, all set under an overcast sky. A section of a white truck's rear is prominent in the immediate foreground on the left, parked next to a green-striped bike lane that extends towards the background. Along the street, in the midground, several people are gathered around numerous green, yellow, and blue delivery bags stacked near hand carts and traffic cones, with a dark UPS truck and other vehicles further down the street. On the right, a dark streetlamp pole stands in the foreground, with a man walking along the sidewalk towards the background.

A man on the right sidewalk walks towards the background, progressively moving out of the frame. A silver SUV initially visible mid-left drives past, revealing more of a dark UPS truck behind it, while another silver SUV moves into the midground from the left. Simultaneously, people in the midground continue to shift and arrange delivery bags and carts along the street, with one person initially bending over becoming more upright. Later, a white SUV also moves from the midground right towards the left background.
