Frame 1 shows a multi-level urban scene with a black car and a white car on a road heading towards a pedestrian overpass and an underpass entrance to the left. Tall glass buildings rise in the background, flanking the view, while a red and white barrier on the far left and a cluster of signs on the far right (including no entry, no right turn, and stop) are visible in the foreground.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the red and white barrier on the left and the clustered road signs on the right pass out of view. The perspective shifts to proceed under the pedestrian bridge, which increasingly fills the upper frame, revealing more of the road and buildings beyond. The black and white cars continue moving ahead, and a new sign pointing to "P IRIS" becomes visible to the right under the bridge.

An elevated concrete overpass spans the top-center, supported by a large cylindrical column on the right, above a road extending forward. A black car is centrally ahead of the viewer, with a silver car to its left, while modern glass buildings line both sides; a "PARIS" sign with an arrow points left on the right column.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the overhead overpass recedes, revealing a clearer sky, and the 'PARIS' sign is replaced by a green directional sign for "NANTERRE" and "LA DÃ‰FENSE". Red and white road barriers emerge on the immediate right, while a person on a scooter/bike appears on the right sidewalk, moving past the viewer, and a new dark car becomes visible on the far left.

The first frame depicts a road scene with a dark grey hatchback visible directly in front of the viewer, slightly to the left within its lane. Tall, modern glass-faced skyscrapers dominate the background and sides; on the left, a 30 km/h speed limit sign stands amidst trees, and an elevated pedestrian bridge crosses the scene further ahead. On the right, a red and white barrier lines the road, behind which a person on a kick scooter moves away from the viewer, next to a large, curved glass building and an arcing street light.
end of description
The dark grey hatchback directly ahead and other vehicles further down the road move forward, receding into the distance relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The person on the kick scooter on the right continues moving away and eventually exits the frame to the right. As the viewer's perspective advances, a triangular warning sign emerges on the left, behind the initial 30 km/h sign, becoming increasingly clear. Simultaneously, a white directional sign becomes fully visible on the right side, behind the red and white barrier.
