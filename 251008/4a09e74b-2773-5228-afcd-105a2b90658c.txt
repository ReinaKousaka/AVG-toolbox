The first frame displays a grey asphalt road curving towards the right, bordered by a green grassy verge with two white roadside markers on its left. A dense forest of varying green trees covers the steep hillside on the left, under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds in the upper right. end of description.
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the roadside markers to move past the viewer and out of frame, and the trees on the left hillside to recede. A dark SUV becomes visible in the distance, ahead and to the right on the road, steadily approaching the viewer. Subsequently, a small, light-colored building emerges further uphill on the right side of the road, behind the approaching SUV, as the landscape opens to reveal more of the distant hills.
