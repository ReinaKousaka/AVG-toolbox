The first frame captures a heavy rain scene on a city street at night, viewed from under an umbrella; a grey car is partially visible in the immediate foreground left, while a dark SUV with a red scooter behind it is parked closer to the viewer on the left street side. To the right, a purple electric scooter rests against a tree, with more trees lining the wet sidewalk leading towards distant bright streetlights and a brightly lit building on the far right. Buildings with colorful neon signs illuminate the background on the left side of the street.

Subsequently, the intense rain persists as the foreground grey car on the left moves slightly forward. A white delivery van then appears from the far background on the left side of the street and travels towards the viewer's left, passing the stationary dark SUV. All other vehicles in the midground and background, including the dark SUV and a red car further down the street, remain motionless.
