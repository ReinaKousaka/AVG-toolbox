The first frame shows a paved road with white dashed center lines and solid edge lines, curving gently to the right in the foreground, flanked by steep, grassy hillsides densely covered in evergreen trees. These forests extend into the background on both the left and right, meeting a bright blue sky adorned with wispy white clouds at the top.

As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, objects from the initial scene, like the road markings and nearby trees, appear to advance towards and then recede past the viewer. A wooden utility pole on the left hillside becomes increasingly prominent in the mid-ground, and in the distance, a snow-capped mountain peak emerges behind the trees on the far right.

The viewer is positioned on a grey asphalt road with a broken white center line and a solid white line marking its right edge, curving gently ahead into the distance. To the immediate left, a steep, grassy, forested hill rises, with a utility pole and wires visible further up and left, while dense conifers line a slightly gentler grassy slope to the right. Above, a bright blue sky streaked with wispy white clouds is visible, and snow-capped mountains peek from behind the trees in the far distance on the right.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the road, new sections of the steep, forested slopes on both the left and right sides come into view from ahead and pass behind the viewer. The initial utility pole on the left recedes and moves out of frame, while a white and red marker pole becomes visible on the right side of the road further along the path. The road markings continuously advance from the distance towards and then beneath the viewer, maintaining the perspective of moving through the mountainous forest, with the distant snowy peaks on the right gradually becoming clearer.
