In the first frame, a man on a bicycle is positioned in the left midground, riding rightward on a paved road with partial white crosswalk lines in the bottom-left foreground. To his left, a white building with green Japanese characters and a red Coca-Cola vending machine is visible. Directly ahead, a patch of green bushes occupies the midground corner, behind which an older, vine-covered structure stands between two taller, light-colored buildings that form the background. A blue arrow sign on a pole is partially obscured by foliage in the far right background, with bright sunlight causing lens flare from the upper right.

The man on the bicycle continuously moves from the left midground towards the right, slowly progressing across the frame. He gradually passes the stationary Coca-Cola vending machine on the left, moving further right relative to its initial position. By the final frames, the cyclist has almost exited the scene to the right of the initial frame's visible area.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a street scene from a low viewpoint, likely from inside a car, with a large white building displaying green Japanese characters directly ahead and slightly to the right. A red Coca-Cola vending machine is positioned on the building's ground floor, while a person on a bicycle moves away on the road to the left, and a partially obscured white car is parked behind a small bush to the right.

end of description
As frames progress, the camera subtly pans left, revealing more of the street and several additional multi-story buildings extending further down the road on the original left side of the scene. The bicyclist continues to move away from the viewer and eventually exits the frame on the left.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a street with a dark, reflective surface in the foreground, leading to a road marked with a white diamond. To the right stands a white building featuring a closed garage and a red Coca-Cola vending machine, while a cyclist moves away on a sidewalk to the left, past a utility pole and buildings in the background.
end of description
The viewer moves forward, causing the red vending machine on the right to recede and exit the frame, revealing more windows on that building. Simultaneously, the cyclist continues further down the street to the left, and additional sidewalk details, including a colorful banner on the left, become visible as the perspective advances.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a street view from a low vantage point, with a dark dashboard visible in the immediate foreground. Ahead, a person rides a bicycle away from the viewer on a paved road marked with a white diamond symbol. To the left, a white building with a garage door and lush greenery leads to a street pole bearing a blue 'straight ahead' arrow sign and a red 'fire hydrant' sign, with colorful banners hanging nearby. On the right, a light-colored building with numerous windows stands alongside a 'no entry' sign on a pole, and a white van is partially parked in front of it. In the background, taller apartment buildings and trees are visible under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer's vehicle moves forward. The person on the bicycle continues riding straight ahead, progressively moving further away and slightly to the left in the road. The white van on the right also advances, becoming more fully visible before gradually exiting the frame towards the right as the viewer passes it. Background buildings and trees consistently recede towards the back and sides of the frame as the vehicle proceeds down the street.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a street scene with a dark dashboard-like surface at the bottom. A street curves slightly right, flanked by buildings; a light-colored multi-story building and a traditional shop with red and orange banners are on the left, while an older, multi-windowed building and a wooden railing with a red 'no entry' sign are on the right. In the distance, several multi-story buildings, including a large grey apartment complex, rise against a clear blue sky, with trees interspersed. A person on a bicycle is visible on the left side of the street, riding away from the viewer.
end of description
The first cyclist on the left continues to move further away from the viewer. In later frames, a second cyclist, wearing a mask, emerges from behind the 'no entry' sign on the right side of the street, entering the scene and cycling leftwards towards the center of the street.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a sunny urban street scene from a low vantage point, possibly inside a car. In the foreground, a dark, reflective surface, likely a dashboard, is visible. To the far right, a man on a blue bicycle wearing a mask and blue shirt cycles towards the viewer, positioned alongside a beige multi-story building with windows and ivy, featuring wooden railings in front of it. On the left, another person on a bicycle cycles away from the viewer on the road, past a building with a red and white banner and a street light pole with blue directional signs. In the background, numerous green trees stand between buildings, with a tall apartment complex visible behind them under a clear blue sky.

end of description

The man on the blue bicycle moves away from the viewer, receding towards the right side and eventually exiting the frame entirely. Simultaneously, the person cycling on the left continues moving deeper into the scene, further away from the viewer. The overall environment, including buildings and trees, remains stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a street scene from a low perspective, with a dark, reflective surface in the immediate foreground. A paved road stretches into the mid-ground, where a person on a bicycle, wearing a blue shirt and white shorts, cycles away from the viewer towards a distant zebra crossing. To the left, a sidewalk features a streetlamp pole adorned with a blue left-arrow sign and a blue children-crossing sign, flanked by a verdant tree. On the right, a wooden railing runs alongside the street, obscuring a lower area, behind which stand low-rise buildings; a tall, multi-story apartment building rises in the background under a clear blue sky.
end of description
In the following frames, the cyclist on the street continuously moves further away from the viewer, progressively crossing the pedestrian zebra crossing. The viewpoint subtly advances forward, revealing more of the sidewalk to the left, where a scooter is parked alongside a newly visible small orange cone. The blue left-arrow traffic sign on the pole to the left is eventually replaced by a green rectangular sign as the perspective slowly shifts.
