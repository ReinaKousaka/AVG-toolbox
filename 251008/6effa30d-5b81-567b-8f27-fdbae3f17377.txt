The street stall to the right reveals more of its stacked hats and the food items become more distinct. Simultaneously, the left stall's hanging goods and the "Supreme" branded bag become clearer as the camera advances, with pedestrians, particularly the person in the white puffer jacket, growing in prominence as they approach the moving viewpoint.
