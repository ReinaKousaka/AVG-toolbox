The first frame captures a rainy city street at night, featuring a large grey utility box in the foreground right, a wet brick sidewalk extending leftward into the distance alongside illuminated buildings, and a street on the right with a silver car's bright headlights partially visible behind the box, utility poles, and distant red traffic lights.
end of description
As the frames progress, the silver car on the street moves forward and slightly left relative to the first-frame viewpoint, gradually revealing its full front and right side as it proceeds along the street, thereby clearing the view previously obstructed by the foreground utility box.
