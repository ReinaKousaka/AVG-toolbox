The first frame displays a railway yard with multiple tracks under an overcast sky, viewed from atop a central track. To the immediate left is a large concrete pillar with white graffiti, while a thin pole supporting a white electrical box is on the immediate right. Straight ahead, the main tracks lead into the distance towards distant buildings and a tunnel entrance. To the left, several tracks run parallel to the viewer, with white trucks and industrial buildings beyond them, while to the right, multiple tracks hold a green, a red, and a white passenger train, backed by a snow-dusted hillside. Overhead, numerous electrical lines and support structures span the scene.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the tracks. The concrete pillar on the immediate left and the pole with the white box on the immediate right recede and exit the frame, revealing more of the tracks, parked white trucks, and industrial buildings to the left. The yellow markers on the ground and the stationary trains on the right appear to approach as the camera progresses through the railway yard, consistent with forward motion.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a wide railway yard stretching into the distance under an overcast sky. In the foreground, numerous tracks with gravel and sparse grass extend forward, with a yellow object visible on the ground to the right. To the left, a loading dock area features several white trucks, while to the right, green and red trains are parked next to a platform, all beneath overhead power lines, with modern buildings and a hillside forming the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the central tracks. The foreground tracks rush beneath the viewer, and the initial yellow object on the right advances towards the bottom of the frame. Subsequently, a new black and yellow striped railway signal emerges from the mid-right, moving closer, while the parked trains and distant buildings gradually recede relative to the viewer's forward motion.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a train yard with multiple tracks converging ahead towards a distant archway under an overcast sky. To the left, modern buildings and a warehouse line the tracks, while to the right, a green train is parked at a platform with a hillside beyond. Overhead wires span the scene, and a yellow signal light is visible on the tracks in the mid-ground to the right.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the central tracks, the immediate foreground continuously updates, and the yellow signal light on the right rapidly approaches, passes, and disappears behind the original viewpoint. Simultaneously, red lines painted on the tracks to the left of the main path become visible and then pass beneath the viewer, while distant objects appear to slowly grow larger, indicating forward progression.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
Multiple parallel train tracks stretch away from the viewer towards the horizon, with a small brown wooden structure positioned to the immediate left of the tracks in the foreground. In the midground, modern glass-fronted buildings and a train station with an arched entrance are visible ahead and to the left. To the right, a train platform holds a green train carriage and a red engine. A steep, tree-covered hillside occupies the far right background, all under an overcast sky.
end of description
The following frames illustrate a slow forward movement along the tracks, causing the foreground objects like the brown structure and trackside markers to progressively shift towards the lower left and right edges of the frame as the viewer advances into the scene.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, multiple train tracks, featuring a prominent switch mechanism in the foreground, lead towards a distant train station. Modern buildings stand to the left, while a platform with a red and green train and a hillside are to the right, all under overhead power lines against an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the tracks, the foreground yellow track marker moves towards the bottom right and off-screen. Simultaneously, the stationary red and green trains on the right platform, and the buildings to the left, become larger as a white truck with a yellow container also grows clearer to the left of the tracks.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
From a low perspective, multiple parallel train tracks extend into the distance, with the viewer seemingly on one of the central tracks. A yellow object is partially visible in the bottom right foreground. In the midground, a brown utility pole with overhead power lines stands slightly right of center. To the left, a long freight train with containers is parked, while a red passenger train is parked on tracks to the right, beside a platform. Further ahead on the central tracks, a white/grey train is visible, leading to a large distant building with an arched roof, presumably a train station. On the left, modern buildings with reflective windows rise, and to the right, a large white building is present, with a steep, wooded hillside and more buildings in the far background under an overcast sky.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the central train tracks towards the distant station. The utility pole in the mid-right passes to the right and exits the frame. The parked freight train on the left and the red passenger train on the right appear to move backward relative to the viewer, indicating the viewer's forward motion, and recede from view. The white/grey train and the station building ahead progressively become larger and closer to the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, multiple parallel train tracks stretch directly in front of the viewer towards the horizon. To the left, several multi-story buildings, including a large modern glass-fronted structure and a curved brown building, rise above freight cars parked on adjacent tracks. To the right, a long modern white building with angled facades stands, with a smaller white building and red train cars further right; a hillside with scattered buildings is visible in the far background. In the mid-ground, a white and red train is stopped on tracks to the right of central platforms, and further down the tracks, a station's arched entrance and another train are visible.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the tracks, causing the gravel ground and tracks immediately beneath to recede behind the viewer. The station platforms and the white and red train on the right progressively approach the viewer, passing to the left and right respectively. Simultaneously, the buildings on both sides—the modern buildings to the left and the white angled building to the right—move closer and also pass by the viewer's sides. The yellow "471 O" sign initially on the right also approaches and moves past, as the arched station entrance further down the tracks gets closer.
