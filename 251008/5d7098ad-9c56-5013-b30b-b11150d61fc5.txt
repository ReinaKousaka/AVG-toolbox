A paved path extends centrally into the midground of a sunlit park, bordered by a fenced grassy area on the left and a shaded tree-lined section with benches on the right. A man wearing headphones, a blue shirt, and blue shorts stands in the foreground to the left, his right arm raised. On the right, two people are seated on a bench, one reading a book, while numerous pedestrians walk further along the path in the midground, leading towards distant city buildings.
end of description
The man on the far left gradually moves out of view to the left of the frame. An initially obscured dark object becomes visible on the ground within the grassy area to the left of the path. Concurrently, a person riding an electric scooter emerges from the depth of the path in the midground, steadily approaching the first-frame viewpoint. Other distant pedestrians also shift their positions, moving further along the path and becoming slightly clearer as they approach. The individuals seated on the right bench remain largely stationary.

In the first frame, a paved pathway stretches into the distance, with a person on an electric scooter approaching centrally from the mid-ground. To the left stands a black lamppost, while on the right, several individuals are seated on wooden park benches, flanked by dense green foliage. Further down the path in the background, more people are visible near a distant statue, surrounded by trees and buildings, with a grassy area bordered by a low fence on the far left.
end of description
Following frames show the person on the electric scooter continuing their movement, passing closer to the viewer and eventually exiting the frame to the viewer's immediate left. Simultaneously, the viewpoint advances slightly forward along the path, causing the stationary lamppost and the people on the benches to appear to recede and shift towards the respective edges of the frame.

In the first frame, a paved pathway extends into the background, bordered by a grassy lawn with trees and a dark fence on the left, and lush green bushes and trees on the right. In the immediate foreground right, a man in a blue cap sits on a wooden bench beside a large tree trunk, with two women seated to his left on the same bench. Numerous people walk away from the viewer along the central path, where a dark sign board is visible on the left edge; distant buildings are discernible through the foliage.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the path, the man on the foreground right bench slowly exits the frame to the right, and the prominent tree trunk also gradually moves out of frame right. The two women remain seated on the bench, shifting further into the foreground right. Concurrently, the sign board on the path's left edge transitions from the midground to the foreground left before passing out of view. The scene continuously reveals more of the path ahead and the park's landscape.
