In the first frame, a wet city street is depicted on a rainy day, with a pedestrian crossing marked by white stripes spanning the lower right foreground. To the left, a wet red lane with dashed white lines runs parallel to a multi-lane asphalt road where a black car in the lower left, and a blue and white bus along with other vehicles in the midground, are driving away from the viewer. Tall buildings and trees line the background on both sides, while the right midground features storefronts with Korean signage and parked vehicles; a person holding a blue umbrella stands in the lower right on the pedestrian crossing.

As the frames progress, the black car in the immediate foreground moves further away, revealing more of the red lane. Simultaneously, the pedestrian with the blue umbrella begins walking across the crosswalk from the right towards the left. Other vehicles, including the blue bus, continue to advance along the wet road, while a new white car enters the frame from the far left. A digital countdown timer appears on the traffic light pole on the right, decrementing as the pedestrian walks.
