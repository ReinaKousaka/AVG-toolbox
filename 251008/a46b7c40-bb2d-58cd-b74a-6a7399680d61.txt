The first frame shows a sunny city street scene. A wide concrete sidewalk extends into the distance on the left, lined by a building facade with large windows and doors. Several pedestrians are visible walking away from the viewer along this sidewalk. On the right, a tree trunk occupies the mid-right, with a black trash bin partially visible at the far right, next to a person in a yellow shirt whose back is to the viewer. A street runs parallel to the sidewalk, where a black SUV is parked along the curb with two men standing next to it. Further down the street, more cars are visible, and buildings line both sides, with a large billboard appearing above one on the right, all under a clear blue sky.

The camera steadily moves forward along the sidewalk, advancing the viewpoint further down the street from the initial position. The person in the yellow shirt on the far right becomes more fully visible as the camera approaches. The two men standing by the black SUV on the right are gradually approached and then partially passed by the camera. Pedestrians ahead on the sidewalk continue to move further away, while new people are continuously revealed walking in the distance towards the original viewpoint.

Subsequently, the viewpoint slowly advances forward, revealing more of the sidewalk, most notably a Hollywood Walk of Fame star appearing on the ground in the lower right, which was initially behind the viewer's original position. Pedestrians continue moving away from the viewer, while the two men on the right remain largely stationary relative to the advancing camera.

The first frame captures a sunlit street scene featuring a sidewalk on the left and a street with parked cars on the right. In the near foreground, a woman in a yellow shirt and black mask holds two Coca-Cola bottles and a backpack, walking towards the viewer. To her immediate left, another woman is partially visible, facing away. Slightly behind the first woman, a child in a red shirt and black mask carries a stack of white pizza boxes. The sidewalk displays 'Hollywood Walk of Fame' stars, extending into the midground where other pedestrians walk away from the viewer. Further down the street, a white Jeep, various cars, distant buildings, and a billboard are visible under a bright sky.
end of description
Following frames show the woman in yellow and the child with pizza boxes moving closer to the viewer and then passing out of the frame to the immediate right and behind the first-frame viewpoint. The blonde woman also moves past to the right and behind. As these individuals exit, more of the storefronts previously obscured by them become visible to the viewer's left. Other pedestrians in the midground continue walking further down the sidewalk away from the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame displays a street scene from a ground-level pedestrian's viewpoint. To the left, a building with dark storefronts featuring mannequins runs alongside a wide concrete sidewalk adorned with two pink star emblems in the foreground. In the mid-ground, a group of pedestrians walks away from the viewer down the sidewalk. On the right, a white car is parked along the curb, with a parking meter/sign and a white Jeep parked further down, parallel to the street where more vehicles are visible, leading to distant buildings and a billboard reading "CANNABIS DELIVERED NOW!".
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the pedestrians on the sidewalk in the mid-ground continue walking away from the viewer. Concurrently, the white Jeep parked on the right side of the street, beyond the initial white car, slowly begins to advance forward. Other background vehicles on the street also exhibit minor, continuous forward movement relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame captures a sunny city street view from a low angle, with a wide sidewalk extending from the foreground on the left, featuring multiple storefronts with mannequins and three pink star plaques embedded in the ground. A group of pedestrians walks away from the viewer in the mid-ground, while a parking meter stands on the right next to a parked white Jeep Wrangler on the street. Further in the background to the right, a billboard advertising "CANNABIS DELIVERED NOW" is visible above other cars and buildings.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the sidewalk, the pedestrians gradually recede into the background, and the parking meter and white Jeep shift further to the right and into the distance. The storefronts on the left also recede, revealing more of the street and additional parked cars further along the right side of the road.
