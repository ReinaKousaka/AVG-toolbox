In the first frame, a person wearing a black coat, a grey beanie, and a grey backpack with brown straps is in the foreground, facing away from the viewer. To the mid-ground right, a person in a patterned cap, green coat, and yellow scarf walks partially into the frame, with another dark-coated individual behind them; further right is a brightly lit commercial building. A blue tour bus with "New York City Bus" graphics moves from left to right in the mid-ground left, bordered by tall city buildings with many lit windows in the background and a white pedestrian structure above. In the foreground bottom-left, a concrete barrier with "NY" is visible.

As the viewpoint progresses, the person in the green coat on the mid-ground right moves further right, revealing more of the individual behind them, while a new person with grey curly hair and an orange scarf emerges into the mid-ground right from outside the initial frame. Simultaneously, the concrete barrier in the foreground left moves with the viewer, revealing "PD" after "NY," completing "NYPD." The blue tour bus on the left continues to move past the initial viewpoint, displaying more of its side. Subsequently, the previously prominent individuals on the right move out of frame towards the rear, and new pedestrians further down the sidewalk become visible ahead on the right.

The first frame depicts a night street scene from a low perspective on a crowded city sidewalk. In the foreground, the back of a person with a dark coat and a grey-and-yellow backpack is prominent, surrounded by other pedestrians walking forward. To the viewer's left, a blue and yellow tour bus is parked, while to the right, a person in a tan jacket sits on a concrete barrier beside a brightly lit building with large display windows.

As the frames advance, the viewpoint moves steadily forward through the bustling crowd on the sidewalk, passing the initially central figures and the person sitting on the right. New pedestrians continuously emerge and pass from behind the original foreground figures, while the tour bus on the left is gradually left behind as the perspective advances down the street.
