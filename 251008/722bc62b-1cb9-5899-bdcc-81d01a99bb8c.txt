In the first frame, a city street extends forward from the viewer. A white sedan is directly in front, followed by a dark car and a yellow bus. To the left, a multi-story building under construction, covered in scaffolding and netting, dominates the background, with lush green trees lining the street in front of it. To the right, green trees canopy the scene, a white van is parked, and a pedestrian walks on the sidewalk, moving away from the viewer. Traffic lights are visible above the street in the midground.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the pedestrian on the right sidewalk continues walking away from the viewer, eventually moving out of frame. Concurrently, the traffic lights ahead and to the left, as well as those further right above the road, transition from red to green. The vehicles directly in front of the viewer, including the white sedan and the yellow bus, remain stationary throughout these changes.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a multi-lane city street from a low viewpoint, with a white car directly in front of the viewer, followed by a yellow bus and other vehicles further down the road. To the left, a building covered in scaffolding and several parked cars line the street, beneath a traffic light with a green signal; to the right, a treelined park and more parked cars occupy the sidewalk, with another green traffic light visible further ahead.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily moves forward along the street. The initial traffic lights move upwards and out of view, revealing more of the road ahead, while new parked vehicles appear at the bottom of the frame, having been further ahead of the viewer's original position. The white car and yellow bus maintain their positions relative to the advancing viewpoint, and the scaffolding-clad building and park recede into the background, further from the original first-frame location.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
A road extends into the distance, lined on both sides by parked cars and tall, leafy trees that form a canopy overhead. To the viewer's immediate left, a dark green pickup truck is visible, and further ahead, a line of white parked cars appears next to a building under scaffolding. In the main lane directly ahead, a white sedan is followed by a yellow bus, with more vehicles visible in the far distance. On the right, a white SUV is partially visible, followed by several parked cars and a red-painted bike lane.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward down the street. The white sedan and yellow bus ahead gradually appear further away as the viewer's position advances relative to them. The parked cars, buildings, and trees lining the road on both sides progressively recede from the viewer's viewpoint, revealing more of the street ahead.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The viewer is positioned on a city street, looking straight ahead. In the immediate foreground, parts of several white cars are parked along the left curb, while dark SUVs are parked along the right curb. In the midground, a white sedan is in the left lane of traffic, followed by a white pickup truck. A yellow bus is centrally located in the right lane, heading away from the viewer, with other vehicles visible further behind it. A dense canopy of green trees arches overhead and lines both sides of the street, partially obscuring buildings on the left and a more natural area on the right. In the distance, the street continues under more trees, with faint buildings and a light sky visible.

end of description

As the viewpoint moves forward, the parked cars on both sides and the trees overhead recede towards the back of the first-frame viewpoint. The white sedan and the yellow bus move further away from the viewer, maintaining their positions in the receding traffic. Consequently, more of the street ahead, including crosswalk markings and traffic lights, becomes visible further into the distance. Buildings on the left side of the street are progressively revealed more clearly and extend further ahead, while the tree canopy thins out in the newly revealed distant scene. More dark parked cars also become visible further down the right side of the street, extending the line of parked vehicles from the initial view.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a city street scene with a white car immediately ahead of the viewer, its brake lights on, a yellow bus stopped to the right, and a pedestrian walking on the left sidewalk next to parked cars and buildings, all framed by green trees and a hazy sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the white car's brake lights turn off, and it, along with the viewer's perspective, begins to move slowly forward. The yellow bus on the right briefly flashes its brake lights, then its right turn signal, before it starts pulling away forward and to the right. Simultaneously, the pedestrian on the left moves further down the sidewalk and out of view, while a dark SUV parks behind the first car on the left. This indicates continuous forward progression of the viewer's vehicle along the tree-lined street.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a street extends away from the viewer into the distance, flanked by rows of lush green trees on both sides. A yellow city bus is parked on the right side of the road, facing away from the viewer, with its rear visible. On the left, several cars are parked parallel to the curb, also facing away, while buildings are partially visible behind the trees on both sides. An overhead traffic light is visible on the far upper left.
end of description
The yellow bus on the right begins to move forward, revealing its right turn signal flashing before it fully moves out of the frame to the viewer's right, exposing more of the sidewalk and tree line on that side. Simultaneously, a person emerges from behind the parked car on the far left, walking towards the viewer's right on the sidewalk. The scene slightly pans left, showing more of the buildings on the left as the bus exits the frame.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a straight city street viewed from a slightly elevated perspective. A two-lane road occupies the center, receding into the distance where multiple cars are visible. To the left, a row of parked cars, including a dark SUV in the foreground with its rear door open and a person standing nearby, line a sidewalk shaded by large, verdant trees. Buildings with multiple windows are visible behind the trees and cars on the left. On the right, a blue and yellow "clean-energy bus" is partially visible in the extreme foreground, heading away from the viewer, with more large trees and a sidewalk with a few distant pedestrians behind it. The sky above is overcast and light, peeking through the tree canopies.
end of description
The blue bus on the right side gradually moves further away from the viewer, progressively revealing more of the sidewalk, a street pole, and pedestrians previously obscured behind it. Simultaneously, the person near the parked SUV on the left moves away from the camera's view, and the SUV's rear door closes. As the sequence progresses, more pedestrians become active on both sidewalks in the mid-ground, and a cyclist is observed crossing the street from left to right in the middle distance. The parked cars on the left side appear to shift slightly, and a new black sedan comes into full view. Overall, the scene subtly brightens, enhancing the visibility of objects and colors.
