A bright winter scene features a vast snow-covered field and a partially frozen pond in the midground, backed by distant, snow-dusted mountains under a clear blue sky with a sun in the upper right. In the immediate foreground, a dark, reflective tiled area is partially covered by snow, with a snow-dusted rectangular object positioned to the viewer's right.
end of description
The camera slowly pans to the viewer's left. The dark foreground tiles and the rectangular object move out of view to the right, revealing more snow-covered ground directly in front. As the pan continues, more of the distant mountain range, including a village or ski resort on its slopes, is revealed to the far left of the original frame.
