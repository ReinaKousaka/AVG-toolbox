Along the left sidewalk, a black easel sign and a distinctive red circular stand are visible, while a white car is parked on the wet street to the viewer's right, with additional buildings and vehicles receding into the distance.

Subsequently, the red circular stand on the left sidewalk smoothly translates leftward and slightly away from the first-frame viewpoint, progressively revealing more of the brick wall and window. It continues its consistent movement further left and deeper into the scene along the sidewalk, appearing to diminish slightly in size as it recedes from the viewer's original position.

The first frame displays a wet urban street receding into the distance, flanked by buildings. To the immediate left, a glass storefront, a red circular sign, a dark information stand, a purple building, and a black pole are visible. On the right, a brick building with stairs and a white SUV parked on an elevated section are present, with yellow lines marking the wet street. end of description. In subsequent frames, the red circular sign and the dark information stand on the left progressively move out of view, with the viewpoint subtly shifting forward to reveal more of the purple building's base and the sidewalk. The black pole on the left and the white SUV on the right become slightly more prominent as a result.

The first frame shows a wet, narrow street receding into the distance. To the viewer's immediate left stands a purple building with a brown wooden structure, followed by an outdoor air conditioning unit on the pavement. Further left, a white building with a dark storefront and a red "Stop" sign is visible. To the viewer's right, a white SUV is parked on an elevated brick planter beneath a tree, with an orange cone further down the street. The asphalt road, marked with two yellow lines, reflects the overcast sky.

As the frames progress, a white rectangular sign with black text, partially obscured, gradually slides into view on the purple building to the left, beyond the brown wooden structure. This sign, which appears to list numbers including "3" and "etc", becomes fully visible by the final frames, revealing a new detail on the previously empty wall.
