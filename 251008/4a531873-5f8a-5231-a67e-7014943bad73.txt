The first frame depicts a sunny residential street with a brick-paved path on the left, alongside a wooden fence, a green hill, and two parked cars in the mid-distance. On the right, an asphalt road leads to a prominent reddish-brown house with a parked white car in front, partially framed by a large foreground tree.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the foreground tree on the right recedes, and the white car eventually moves further out of sight to the right. Concurrently, a new light-colored building emerges on the far left, beyond the initial parked cars, while the dark car previously visible on the left approaches the viewer.
