To the right, an outdoor cafe with numerous tables, chairs, and white umbrellas occupies the foreground, stretching further down the street alongside other buildings. Several pedestrians are scattered along the central walkway, which recedes towards distant buildings and trees under a bright sky.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the street scene remains static, but a man in a blue jacket and grey trousers steadily walks towards the viewer from the mid-ground on the left side of the walkway. Other pedestrians also continue their movement along the street, either approaching or receding from the initial viewpoint.

A man in a blue blazer walks towards the viewer on the left, while other pedestrians are visible further down the street.
end of description
As the frames progress, the man in the blue blazer continues walking towards the viewer from the left mid-ground, growing larger as he approaches, eventually exiting the frame to the left foreground. Simultaneously, other pedestrians further down the street continue their movement away from the viewer. No new objects or scenes are revealed beyond the initial street view.

In the first frame, a bustling pedestrian street is viewed from a slightly elevated perspective. To the foreground right, a white cafe umbrella partially covers two dark outdoor tables and chairs. Along the right midground, several shopfronts are visible, including "Greta," and a tree with green leaves stands before them, casting shadows on the pavement. On the left midground, a person in a white t-shirt and blue jeans walks towards the viewer while looking at a phone, with several other pedestrians walking further down the street away from the viewer. The background shows the street receding into the distance, lined with buildings and more trees, with a white car far ahead.
end of description
The man in the white t-shirt and blue jeans, initially in the mid-left, walks towards the viewer and exits the frame to the left. Subsequently, a woman in a light blue top and dark pants, previously behind him, moves into the foreground left, approaching the viewer. Other pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue moving further away from the viewer into the midground and background. On the right sidewalk, a woman in a yellow top also progresses further into the background.

The first frame displays an urban pedestrian street flanked by multi-story buildings, adorned with balconies and storefronts, under a bright sky. In the foreground left, an older woman with white hair, wearing a light blue top and dark pants, walks towards the right. Behind her on the left, a couple walks away from the viewer, while on the right, a person in a dark blue coat stands near outdoor restaurant seating with white umbrellas. The street recedes into the background, revealing more pedestrians and a distant white car.

The woman in the foreground left moves past the viewer, proceeding further right until she exits the frame. Concurrently, the couple on the left continues walking further away, deepening their position along the street. The person in the dark blue coat on the right remains largely stationary from the initial viewpoint, while other distant pedestrians also move further into the background scene.
