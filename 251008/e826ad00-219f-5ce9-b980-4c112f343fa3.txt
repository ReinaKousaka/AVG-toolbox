The first frame captures a rainy night street scene with reflective wet surfaces. In the foreground, a dark, wet sidewalk is on the left, separated by a curb from an equally wet street on the right. A dark pole stands slightly right of center, with a small tree behind it. In the midground, a person holding a black umbrella walks from left to right across a crosswalk. To their left, a black BMW is partially visible, and further down the sidewalk, other pedestrians with umbrellas are walking away from the viewer past parked cars. On the right side of the street, a white van and a silver sedan with illuminated headlights are visible, along with multiple vehicles receding into the distance, their bright lights reflecting on the street. The background features illuminated city buildings under a dark sky.

The person with the black umbrella continues walking across the crosswalk, turning to proceed down the left sidewalk, eventually obscuring the BMW. Simultaneously, the white van and silver sedan on the right side of the street slowly move forward, with other distant cars also advancing, their headlights casting strong reflections on the wet asphalt. More pedestrians with umbrellas become slightly clearer on the left sidewalk as the central figure moves past the black BMW.

The first frame shows a rainy city street with a wet sidewalk on the left, where a person holding a black umbrella walks towards the viewer, passing parked cars. On the right, a utility pole stands near garbage bags on the sidewalk, while the wet road features cars with illuminated headlights moving away into the background of glowing city buildings.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the person with the black umbrella continues walking closer to the viewer on the left sidewalk. Simultaneously, two white cars on the right side of the road move further away from the viewer, their headlights reflecting on the wet asphalt. Pedestrians with umbrellas further down the sidewalk also recede into the distance as the rain persists.
