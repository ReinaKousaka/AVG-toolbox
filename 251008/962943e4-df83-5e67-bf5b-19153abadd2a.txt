The first frame shows a street scene with four individuals walking away from the viewer on a paved path on the left. The nearest person is partially visible on the far left, followed by a lighter-clad person, a person in a dark jacket, and finally a white-haired individual in a blue jacket, all heading towards the background. To the right of the path, a road is separated by a black barrier with red chevrons from a busy street featuring traditional buildings, a distant spire, and a partially visible blue and white tram on the far right.
end of description
In subsequent frames, all four individuals continue to walk forward, receding further into the distance along the paved path relative to the initial viewpoint. The person on the far left gradually moves out of view as they progress forward. Simultaneously, the blue and white tram on the right moves forward, fully entering the frame before beginning to exit off the right edge, moving along the street to the right of the barriers.
