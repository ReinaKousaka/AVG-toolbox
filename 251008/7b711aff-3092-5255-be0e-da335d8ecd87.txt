The first frame depicts a wet urban street scene at night. To the left, a modern building displaying "TWIN TREE A" on its illuminated facade stands behind a series of long, dark orange planters filled with green bushy plants that extend into the midground. The foreground and midground feature a wet, tiled sidewalk, with an LG air conditioner unit visible on the far right. In the background, a street with approaching vehicle headlights and various illuminated buildings under a dark sky is visible, along with a structure on the far right featuring Korean text.

Two individuals in yellow safety vests appear from behind the left-midground planters near the "TWIN TREE A" entrance, moving towards the right side of the frame. Simultaneously, a bright green light reflects prominently on the wet street and sidewalk in the midground-right, originating from a distant traffic light that illuminates green. The initial distant vehicle's headlights become clearer before it progresses past the visible area. The two individuals continue their movement to the right, eventually disappearing from view beyond the frame's right edge. In the final frames, a distant streetlamp on the right illuminates, and a partial advertisement panel on the far right of the sidewalk becomes more defined.

The first frame depicts a wet, rainy urban street scene at night. To the viewer's immediate left, a row of green bushes in brown planters lines a patterned sidewalk, behind which a glass building reflects ambient light. The patterned sidewalk extends into the distance, with reflections of green streetlights visible on its wet surface. To the viewer's right, a sign on a dark vertical structure partially obstructs a shorter line of green hedges. Further ahead, a bright street lamp illuminates the wet street and a bare tree, while distant city lights and traffic signals pierce the rainy gloom.

The viewpoint slowly shifts forward and slightly to the right, revealing new elements relative to the initial frame. Progressively, more of a white picket-style barrier and a yellow cart behind the planters on the viewer's left are brought into full view. Concurrently, the line of green hedges on the viewer's right extends further back, becoming more prominent from the initial position. A tall, bare tree on the far right, initially partially obscured by the lamp post, becomes more fully visible. Furthermore, a building on the right side of the street and additional traffic lights, including a distinct red vehicle light, appear more clearly in the distance straight ahead.

A wet, checkered paved sidewalk extends into a dimly lit city street scene at night, flanked by large green bushes in planters to the left and smaller bushes to the right. A street lamp stands in the mid-ground, illuminating a wet street with reflections, and a distant green traffic light, while red vehicle taillights are visible moving away to the left on the street.
end of description
Following frames show a red vehicle continuing to move forward and further left on the distant street. A white truck then emerges from the left and proceeds forward on the street, passing the red vehicle. As the vehicles move further away and disappear from view, a prominent circular glare from raindrops on the camera lens appears in the upper right, gradually diminishing by the last frame.
