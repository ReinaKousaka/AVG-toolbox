The first frame shows a city street with a crosswalk in the foreground, leading to a sidewalk on the right. On this sidewalk, a food cart with two people nearby is in the midground, while one pedestrian moves right-to-left past it and another, closer, walks away from the viewer on the far right, all against a backdrop of distant buildings and parked cars on the left street.
end of description
Subsequently, the pedestrian on the far right continues walking away from the viewer, moving out of frame, while the pedestrian initially walking right-to-left past the food cart exits the frame to the left. Concurrently, new pedestrians emerge from the background on the sidewalk, walking towards the viewer, and vehicles in the distant street subtly shift positions.

The first frame depicts a vibrant city street with a hot dog stand and its yellow umbrella on the far left, displaying various foods and drinks. To its right, two pedestrians walk towards the viewer on the sidewalk, which extends to the right past a building with reflective windows and a "FOR LEASE" sign, revealing more people in the distant background.
end of description
The two initial pedestrians move past the viewer's left, while a woman in a dark dress and red hat appears from behind them, moving forward on the sidewalk. She then runs rapidly towards the viewer, no longer wearing the hat and carrying a jacket, eventually passing the hot dog stand on the left and exiting the scene, leaving the foreground empty.

The first frame shows a city sidewalk in the foreground, with a red-brown road lane and parked/moving cars on the left, and a building with a large reflective window and a person sitting on a box on the right. Pedestrians, including a man in a red jacket, populate the mid-ground sidewalk, set against a backdrop of tall city buildings and sky. end of description. Over subsequent frames, the man in the red jacket prominently walks from the mid-ground towards and past the viewer on the left sidewalk, eventually moving out of the frame as other pedestrians behind him also approach the viewer. The black car on the road to the left remains stationary, and the person seated on the right remains in their position throughout.
