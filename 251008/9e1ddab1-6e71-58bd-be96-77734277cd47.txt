In the first frame, a snowy winter village is seen from a moving vehicle, likely a train, with a dark window frame partially obscuring the view on the far right. Ahead, railroad tracks curve towards the right, bordered by a snow-covered landscape featuring a pole with overhead wires and a small building on the right. To the left, a wooden fence parallels the tracks, beyond which a cluster of traditional wooden houses with snow-laden roofs and scattered snow-covered trees ascend a gentle slope. Dominating the distant background on the right is a majestic, snow-capped mountain under a clear blue sky, while a forested hill rises on the left.

As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks. The foreground pole with wires, the tracks, and the small building on the right shift leftward relative to the frame. A red and white striped barrier, initially partially obscured behind the pole on the right, progressively becomes more visible and prominent. The snow-covered road, seen in the mid-ground, appears to approach the tracks and eventually passes beneath the visible overhead wire system.

The first frame shows a snow-covered village and mountains from inside a train, with the dark window frame visible on the right. In the foreground, a prominent snow-laden railway signal pole stands left of center, while train tracks curve along the right. Numerous wooden chalets are visible in the mid-ground, flanked by a snow-covered mountain on the left and a majestic peak in the distant right.

As the viewpoint moves forward, the prominent signal pole in the foreground exits left, fully revealing a blue street sign in the mid-ground, initially showing "Wengenstrasse," whose text subsequently changes to "Aegerdenstrasse" and then "Ninggeestrasse" as it passes. Concurrently, smoke begins to rise from a chalet chimney in the mid-ground, while the entire snow-covered village vista shifts rightward.
