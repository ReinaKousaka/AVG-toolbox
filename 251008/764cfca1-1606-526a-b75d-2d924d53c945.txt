The first frame displays an expansive outdoor patio featuring an infinity pool overlooking the ocean in the background, bordered by lush green hills. To the mid-ground left, a built-in outdoor kitchen with a chimney and grill adjoins a bar counter, while a man in a dark suit walks towards the pool, past several wooden lounge chairs with white towels on the right and a white sofa in the foreground right.

The man continues walking further right towards the pool, then turns to face left, gesturing towards the bar area where more wooden bar stools with white woven seats become visible near the counter on the mid-ground left. Finally, he turns around to admire the ocean view in the background.
