The first frame depicts a covered walkway with a cafe on the left, featuring black tables and chairs under a white umbrella in the foreground. In the mid-ground, a blonde woman, seen from behind and carrying shopping bags, walks towards the right, passing a large black pillar in the center. In the background, two shops are visible: one on the left with a 'BAR AB TABACCHERIA SOUVENIR' sign above display cases, and another on the right with a 'LA BOTTEGA DEL REGALO SOUVENIR & OGGETTISTICA' sign and a brightly lit display case to its left.

As the video progresses, the woman continues walking to the right, moving past the black pillar and eventually exiting the frame from the right side. Her movement reveals more of the interior display of the 'SOUVENIR & OGGETTISTICA' shop to the right of the pillar. Additionally, a red stool becomes fully visible in the mid-ground, to the left of the central pillar where the woman was previously walking.
