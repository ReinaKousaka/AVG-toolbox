The first frame depicts a wet paved path curving right, bordered by a silver railing and green bushes to its left. Beyond this, a body of water adjoins a dark wooden boardwalk with two covered structures, extending towards a multi-arched concrete bridge in the background, with dense trees on the far left and a large tree trunk on the far right. An awning is visible overhead.

As the scene progresses, a subtle forward camera movement along the path slowly reveals more of the bridge and its right side, which are further from the initial viewpoint. Throughout the frames, visible rain streaks down and splashes on the water to the left of the boardwalk and on the ground, indicating continuous rainfall.
