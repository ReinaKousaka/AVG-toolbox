The first frame displays a park scene with a paved path leading into the distance, curving gently right. On the left, several people are seated on two park benches beneath a large tree and near a lamppost, with a red-brick building partially visible beyond. The right side features green grass and more empty park benches lining the path. Numerous trees and a large, light-colored building with multiple windows are seen in the midground and background, under a bright sky.
end of description
The camera slowly pans to the left and subtly advances forward. The women initially seated on the leftmost bench gradually move further to the left, out of the initial frame's view. Concurrently, a new woman in a grey top, previously located just to the immediate left of the first-frame viewpoint, becomes fully visible on the leftmost bench. The entire scene, including the path and background buildings, subtly shifts right relative to the initial viewing position.
