The first frame presents a narrow asphalt road receding from the viewer, bordered by structures under an overcast sky. On the right, a white building with an overhanging leafy branch has a red car parked in its driveway. To the left, a utility pole with dense overhead wires stands before other buildings, with a partial view of a white building closer to the viewer.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, a white building on the immediate left, previously partially obscured, reveals a dark shutter, a white mailbox, and an external metal staircase. Simultaneously, the white building on the right moves further right, unveiling a bicycle with a box parked behind the red car, which was initially hidden from view to the right of the car's rear, as the road ahead expands.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
In the first frame, a narrow paved road extends into the midground under an overcast sky, winding slightly uphill. To the immediate left stands a white two-story building with a dark corrugated metal shutter door, an external metal staircase, and a sign with Japanese text above the door; a small white cabinet is positioned below the sign. To the right, a dark red car is parked partially visible beneath a white carport, in front of a residential building with a tiled roof. A utility pole with numerous power lines is visible in the midground right, with more buildings and greenery receding into the distance on both sides of the road.
end of description
Across the subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly advances forward and slightly rightward relative to the scene. The white building on the left gradually occupies more of the left foreground, making its sign and shutter door more prominent. Concurrently, the red car on the right progressively shifts further out of frame, revealing more of the building and concrete wall behind it as the viewer approaches the bend in the road.

The first frame depicts a narrow paved street curving gently uphill into the distance, lined by urban buildings under an overcast sky. Immediately to the viewer's left, a light-colored building displays a dark corrugated shutter, a sign with Japanese characters, and a dirty white box attached near the bottom; to the right, a low wall with potted plants and houses flank the street, with utility poles and wires overhead.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewer moves forward along the street. The sign and the attached box on the immediate left gradually recede out of view from the bottom left, revealing more of the building's textured wall and a window further along its side. The overall scene ahead, including distant buildings and utility poles, appears closer and shifts slightly towards the right of the frame relative to the initial viewpoint, indicating forward movement.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a narrow street, bordered on the left by a textured grey building with a window, and on the right by a low wall with potted plants and green shrubs, leading uphill towards a multi-story brown apartment building under an overcast sky with utility wires overhead.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the left building recedes, revealing a parked dark car and a white object on the pavement to the left of the road. Concurrently, the street progresses, bringing more of the distant buildings closer into view on both sides.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a narrow, dark grey street extending forward and curving uphill, flanked by buildings under an overcast sky crisscrossed by utility wires. To the left, a white wall gives way to a covered parking area with two cars and numerous potted plants, while on the right, a cream-colored building and a multi-story brown apartment building line the road.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the street, objects on both sides recede, expanding the visible scene. A blue bicycle gradually appears parked on the right sidewalk, and a white bicycle becomes visible on the far left in front of the covered parking area, revealing elements previously just outside the initial frame's edges.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a narrow residential street under an overcast sky. To the left, a white house features a translucent carport, with a partial view of a bicycle in the extreme bottom-left and two parked cars (a blue SUV and a dark sedan) further back. Adjacent to these vehicles are several potted plants. On the right, a multi-story building with balconies lines the street, which curves uphill away from the viewer, while a light blue bicycle is parked near a smaller building on the far right. Utility poles and wires crisscross overhead.
end of description
The viewpoint gradually pans to the right, causing the bicycle in the bottom-left foreground to recede further out of frame. As the camera moves, a large gray bin and then a concrete block post with a mailbox are progressively revealed to the left of the parked cars, moving into the bottom-left foreground. Concurrently, the light blue bicycle parked on the far right becomes more prominent. By the final frames, a person emerges walking away from the viewer on the street in the mid-distance.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a residential street with a light grey planter box and a blue SUV in the left foreground, followed by a dark SUV. Across the paved street on the right is a brown apartment building lined with bushes, a bicycle, and various power lines crisscross the overcast sky above surrounding buildings.
end of description
A white car, initially hidden behind the dark SUV in the mid-left, gradually emerges from behind it and begins moving right along the street. It continues to drive past the viewer's mid-right, slowly exiting the frame to the right.
