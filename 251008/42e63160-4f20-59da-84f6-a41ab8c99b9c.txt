In the first frame, a street extends directly in front of the viewer into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings. To the left, a large building, possibly a mall, features shopfronts at ground level with many parked scooters, and a prominent billboard on an upper floor displaying two faces. To the right, another building lines the street, with parked scooters along the sidewalk and traffic signs, including a '40' speed limit. A white van is positioned in the left lane, ahead and slightly to the left, while a light green taxi and a white sedan are in the right lane, ahead and to the right. The sky above is clear blue with a sunflare in the upper center-right, and a circular map overlay is visible in the top-left corner.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the street from the initial viewpoint. The white van on the left and the light green taxi and white sedan on the right all advance forward, gradually moving out of sight towards the front of the original scene. Concurrently, the large billboard on the building to the left dynamically changes from displaying two faces to a single woman's face. A new white sedan is revealed further down the street in the right lane, moving forward to occupy the space previously held by the earlier vehicles before also exiting the frame to the front-right. The map overlay in the top-left corner continually updates to reflect the ongoing forward movement.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a wide city street extending into the distance under a bright, sunny sky, with an overlaid circular navigation map in the top-left corner. To the viewer's left is a multi-story commercial building featuring several large billboards and a row of parked scooters and motorcycles along its sidewalk. To the viewer's right, another multi-story commercial building with various storefronts and a bus shelter runs parallel to the street, with a white car parked prominently in the foreground; traffic signs are mounted on a pole near this building. The road itself is mostly empty of traffic in the immediate foreground, with shadows cast across it, and buildings line both sides as it recedes.
end of description
As the frames progress, three scooters initially traveling away from the viewer in the middle of the road continue their movement further into the distance. A person initially positioned closer to the viewer on the right sidewalk walks further down the street and eventually moves out of the frame to the right. Concurrently, the number of pedestrians on the right sidewalk near the bus shelter increases and their positions shift, with some moving closer to the roadside. Subtle movements and minor changes in the positions of other pedestrians are also observed on both sidewalks.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a straight-on view down a sunlit urban street, flanked by multi-story commercial buildings on both sides. On the left, a large building displays advertisements above street-level shops, with parked scooters and pedestrians on the sidewalk. To the right, another commercial structure features a bus stop and more parked scooters in the foreground. Several motorcycles are on the road ahead, moving away from the viewer, with a navigation map overlay visible in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the scene steadily advances forward along the street, causing the road ahead to progressively fill the frame and buildings to appear closer. The motorcycles on the road continue moving further away, and a yellow road divider gradually appears and extends in the center of the street, while the navigation overlay updates its distance readings.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a broad street extending into the distance under a bright blue sky, with the sun shining from the upper left. On the left, a multi-story building with large glass windows and commercial signage lines the road, accompanied by parked cars, motorbikes, and a pedestrian on the sidewalk, with a metal fence in the immediate foreground. Opposite, on the right, stands another large commercial complex with colorful storefronts, glass elements, numerous parked motorbikes, and a street lamp pole. Two motorbikes are observed traveling forward on the road ahead, while a circular navigation map overlay is present in the upper left.
end of description
As the viewpoint progressively moves forward along the street, the buildings lining both sides appear to approach and grow larger. The two motorbikes initially ahead continue to move further away, receding into the distance. A white car parked on the left gradually comes closer to the viewer. Subsequently, a silver SUV emerges from the distant left side of the road, driving towards and then past the viewer's initial position. The street lamp pole on the right also advances closer into view.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a wide street extending forward, lined with multi-story buildings and numerous parked scooters on both the left and right sides. A silver car is parked prominently to the immediate left, while a large "Suning" building with various storefronts dominates the right, and several motorcycles with riders move down the road ahead, further into the scene. Overhead, a bright, clear blue sky is visible, and a circular navigation map is overlaid in the upper-left corner.
end of description
In the following frames, the scene subtly shifts as the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The parked vehicles on the sides appear to recede relative to the viewer, and the motorcycles traveling ahead progress further into the distance. Concurrently, the navigation map overlay in the upper-left corner updates, showing a slight advancement of the viewer's position along the designated route.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a wide city street from a low-angle perspective, flanked by multi-story commercial buildings on both sides, with signs like 'BOSS' on the left and 'SUNING' prominently on the right, along with numerous parked scooters and bicycles by fences. A distant cityscape is visible under a bright blue sky with a visible sun on the upper left, while a circular GPS map overlay is present in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the street; the buildings and parked vehicles on either side recede slightly, and a white directional arrow gradually appears on the road directly in front of the viewer, indicating forward movement.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The viewer is positioned on a paved road looking straight ahead down a bustling city street flanked by multi-story commercial buildings under a bright, sunny sky with a strong glare in the upper left. A dark metal barrier runs along the left and right sides of the road in the foreground, beyond which numerous motorcycles are parked along sidewalks fronting tall buildings adorned with glass facades, storefronts, and advertisements. Several motorcycles and a white car are visible moving forward on the road, with more buildings receding into the distant background. A circular navigation map overlay is present in the upper-left corner.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the buildings and parked motorcycles on both sides recede backward relative to the first-frame viewpoint, revealing more of their extended structures. The vehicles ahead, including a white car and several motorcycles, advance further forward down the street, while a new white car enters the right lane from behind the initial car. The navigation map in the upper-left corner dynamically updates, showing the viewer's position progressing along the route and the remaining distance decreasing.
