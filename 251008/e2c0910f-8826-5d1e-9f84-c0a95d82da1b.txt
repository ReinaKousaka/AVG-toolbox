The viewer is positioned in a vibrant purple-walled hallway with a glossy light wood floor. To the immediate left, a white framed picture hangs above an ornate dark console table with gold accents, topped by a clear vase of colorful flowers. On the right, a wooden staircase with a balustrade ascends upwards, partially obscured by a prominent white column in the foreground, behind which a golden cylindrical object is visible. Straight ahead, the hallway extends into the distance, leading to white double doors with louvered blinds. Further down the left wall, an alcove with another small ornate table and a vase of flowers is seen, and on the right, a doorway leads to another room.

The camera gradually moves forward and slightly to the right from the initial viewpoint. The large white column, initially to the immediate right of the first-frame viewpoint, moves out of view to the far right, fully revealing the golden cylindrical object and the lower section of the wooden staircase, which were partially obscured behind it. Concurrently, the ornate console table and flowers on the left move further away and to the left of the original viewpoint's path, and the white framed picture on the upper left recedes further left and upwards out of sight. A recessed niche on the left wall, initially partially visible further down the hall to the left of the first-frame viewpoint, now becomes fully visible with its floral arrangement. The double doors and the hallway, initially straight ahead in the distance, appear progressively closer to the viewer.

The first frame displays a purple-walled foyer with a glossy light wood floor. In the foreground to the right, a wooden staircase and banister are partially visible, while to the left, a recessed wall niche with flowers sits above an antique table and a gold-framed mirror. Straight ahead are double white louvered doors, and to the right, an open doorway leads to another room with a large window.
end of description
As the camera subtly moves forward and pans slightly left, the wooden staircase on the immediate right recedes and disappears from view. Concurrently, the doorway further along the right wall opens wider, revealing more of the sunlit room beyond it. Subsequently, a new white paneled door appears and begins to open inward on the far right, closer to the viewer than the previously seen doorway.

In the first frame, a spacious hallway with polished light wooden floors and purple walls is visible. To the left, a decorative wooden console table with ornate legs holds two white candles in a clear holder, positioned beneath a large mirror with a gold frame. Centered at the far end of the hallway are white double doors with horizontal blinds, leading outdoors, with a dark mat on the floor directly in front of them. White decorative pillars flank these doors, and to the right of the right pillar, a wall-mounted sconce emits a warm light. An open doorway on the right wall leads into another room with dark green walls, a prominent arched window with white blinds, and a glimpse of a chair.
end of description
The camera slowly pans to the right, gradually revealing more of the green-walled room through the open doorway. As the pan continues, a desk and an office chair inside this right-side room become increasingly visible, moving further into the frame from the right. Simultaneously, the console table on the far left of the initial view subtly moves out of the frame.
