The first frame shows a narrow, brick-paved street leading away from the viewer, with a manhole cover in the center. On the left is a light-colored brick building with a red awning and dark-framed windows. To the right, a brown brick building prominently displays a "KIEHL'S SINCE 1851" sign, with a woman walking on the sidewalk beside it. A white SUV is parked centrally on the street, facing away, and behind it, two people in red uniforms stand on the sidewalk to the left. In the background, a stone wall is visible, topped with trees under a bright sky.

As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the street. The woman, initially to the right of the white SUV, walks ahead and to the left, eventually passing the stationary SUV and exiting the frame to the left. The white SUV and the two people in red uniforms, originally in the mid-ground, appear closer as the viewpoint advances. The buildings on both sides also become more prominent and closer to the viewer.

In the first frame, the viewer looks down a paved street with a building facade on the immediate left featuring a dark awning and a white utility box. To the right, a brick building with large display windows, showing a poster, and signage like "160" and "CELEBRATING" is visible. Two individuals in red shirts and hats are walking away from the viewer in the mid-ground, slightly left of center on the street. Behind them, a white SUV is parked against a stone retaining wall topped with a fence and trees in the background.

The camera moves forward along the paved street. The two individuals in red shirts continue walking away from the initial viewpoint, moving further down the street. As the camera progresses, the white SUV, initially visible behind the individuals on the right, moves out of the frame. The building on the viewer's left and a silver utility unit on its facade appear closer to the initial viewpoint, as does the brick building on the right, revealing more architectural detail. A manhole cover in the street also becomes more prominent in the foreground.
