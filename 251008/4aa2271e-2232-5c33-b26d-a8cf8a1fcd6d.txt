The first frame captures a night scene on a city street, looking straight ahead between tall buildings with illuminated windows on both sides. On the asphalt road, a white 'ONLY' arrow is prominent, with a lamppost and a street food cart on the left sidewalk, and a silver car parked among others on the right foreground.

As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, objects like the 'ONLY' arrow, the lamppost, and the food cart on the left recede out of frame, and a pedestrian walks past the viewer on the left. Concurrently, the parked silver car on the right moves out of the immediate foreground, progressively revealing more of the street, additional parked vehicles, and building facades further ahead.

The first frame depicts a nighttime street scene, looking straight down a paved road. To the viewer's immediate left, a yellow food cart and blue trash bins are positioned on the sidewalk, in front of a building with illuminated windows. Further down on the left, a LinkNYC kiosk stands near other street furniture and signs, including one indicating "LEFT LANE MUST TURN LEFT." On the viewer's right, several cars are parked along the curb, with a white sedan prominent in the foreground, followed by a dark SUV, and other vehicles receding into the distance; trash canisters are also visible near the sidewalk edge. Tall city buildings line both sides of the street, illuminated by internal lights, all beneath a dark night sky, with a dark horizontal structure overhead and traffic lights visible further down the street.

Subsequently, the white sedan parked on the right side of the street begins to move forward and to the right, gradually exiting the frame completely. This movement fully reveals a dark sedan previously obscured behind it. Concurrently, the blue display on the LinkNYC kiosk on the left side of the street changes to a dark screen, indicating a dynamic display change.
