The first frame depicts the viewer following two individuals from behind: a woman in a pink shirt on the left and a man in a black shirt with a green logo on the right, both walking forward in a traditional open-air corridor. To their right, a white wall with dark wooden windows stretches into the distance, while to their left, an open courtyard houses a group of people and a tree trunk, bordered by pillars and a tiled roof. The corridor recedes into the background, showcasing similar architecture.

The camera moves forward, following the initial two figures as they proceed further along the corridor, away from the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, a new person's head with dark hair appears in the lower right foreground, to the right of the original path, as the view progresses. The group of people and the architectural details of the courtyard to the left of the initial viewpoint become more prominent and closer as the scene advances.

In the first frame, the viewer is positioned in a covered walkway with a dark wooden beamed ceiling overhead and dark pillars on both sides. Three individuals with their backs to the viewer occupy the immediate foreground, walking forward: a person in a black t-shirt centrally, flanked by two in light pink shirts. To the left, a white building with dark windows houses several people, some walking towards the viewer. To the right, a long building with dark, patterned wooden windows and a white lower wall stretches into the distance, while a paved path and some trees are visible between the structures.

The camera moves forward along the corridor, following the three individuals. As the viewpoint advances, a person in a dark t-shirt and hat, looking at a phone, becomes more prominent on the left side, standing still while the camera approaches and passes them. The architectural details of the hallway's walls and ceiling continue to reveal themselves, and the perspective deepens as the pathway recedes further into the background.

The first frame depicts a covered outdoor walkway with traditional Asian architecture, receding into the distance. In the midground, three individuals are walking away from the viewer; two in pink shirts flank a person in a black shirt. To the left, a parallel walkway with white walls and dark windows leads to another building and glimpses of green trees, where a small group of people are gathered. On the right, a long corridor with dark wooden lattice windows and doors stretches away from the viewer, with an A-frame sign resting against its wall. Overhead, dark wooden beams and rafters form the roof structure.
end of description
The camera slowly moves forward along the covered walkway, causing the three individuals in the midground to move further into the distance. As the viewpoint advances, the architectural details of the corridor on the right and the building on the left become clearer and closer. The group of people on the far left recedes, revealing a child playing further in the background to the left. The A-frame sign on the right and the support pillars on the left move further back relative to the frame, consistent with the viewer progressing down the pathway.

The first frame shows the viewer inside a covered dark wooden corridor with a patterned brick floor. Ahead and slightly to the left, three people are walking away from the viewer: two women in pink shirts and a man in a dark shirt. To the viewer's right, a long wooden wall with multiple intricate windowpanes extends into the distance. To the left, dark wooden pillars frame an open courtyard with trees and white buildings, while a small child is faintly visible far down the corridor's center.
end of description
The camera moves forward along the corridor, causing the three people ahead of the viewer to move further away and eventually exit the frame to the left. A brown wooden sign with Chinese characters, initially outside the first frame's right edge, is revealed on the right wall as the viewpoint advances. The small child previously in the far background appears progressively larger and closer as the camera approaches them.
