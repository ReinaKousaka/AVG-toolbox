In the first frame, two parallel railway tracks extend into the midground from the viewer's position. To the left of the tracks, a grassy and shrub-covered embankment slopes upwards, with tree-covered hills visible in the distant background under a clear sky. To the right, a stone retaining wall with several arched openings runs alongside the tracks, topped with dense green and patches of red foliage, leading towards a dimly visible tunnel entrance in the center. Two railway signals stand between the tracks; the left signal appears dark, while the right signal shows a red light on top.

As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the right signal's top light changes from red to yellow, then to a vertical white light, indicating a change in signal aspect. Concurrently, the '50' sign on the left signal's post and other small white arrow signs on the right retaining wall become clearer and closer as they pass the viewer. The tunnel entrance, initially in the central background, gradually approaches, and the surrounding landscape details on both sides of the tracks shift from mid-ground to foreground.

The first frame presents a view down a set of railway tracks leading into the distance. To the immediate left, a prominent black and white railway signal pole stands, displaying the numbers "30," "Nf," and "3302 PR." On the right, a stone retaining wall featuring several arched openings supports a steep hillside densely covered with green and some reddish-brown trees, extending into the background where a dark tunnel entrance is visible. To the left of the tracks, a gentle, vegetated embankment slopes down to reveal further trees and distant hills under a clear sky.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the tracks, the railway signal pole on the immediate left quickly passes out of view to the left. The stone retaining wall with its arches on the right gradually approaches and recedes, revealing more sections of the wall and the dense foliage above it. The entire landscape of distant hills and trees on both sides continuously shifts as the viewpoint progresses along the tracks towards the distant tunnel.

The first frame displays two sets of train tracks extending into the distance, bordered on the left by a grassy embankment with a small puddle and on the right by a stone retaining wall with multiple arched recesses, topped by dense green foliage. In the distant background to the left, hills with scattered buildings are visible, while a dark tunnel entrance appears centered above the tracks.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the puddle on the left recedes from the foreground and eventually disappears from view, while the arched sections of the stone wall on the right move closer before passing by. Concurrently, the distant tunnel entrance progressively approaches the viewer.
