The first frame presents a rainy street scene from the perspective of a sidewalk, stretching from the bottom towards the misty background. To the viewer's right, a dark metal barrier separates the wet sidewalk from a multi-lane road where a red bus and other cars are visible driving away into the distance, alongside pedestrians crossing with umbrellas. On the left, a person stands under a black umbrella further down the sidewalk, next to a green hedge and a white fence, beneath a line of trees, as heavy rain falls across the entire vista.

Throughout the following frames, the heavy rain continues to fall consistently across the entire scene. Vehicles on the wet road, including the red bus, gradually move further into the distance away from the viewer. Concurrently, pedestrians in the far midground continue their crossing motion across the road from the right towards the left. The person on the left sidewalk holding the umbrella remains largely stationary.
