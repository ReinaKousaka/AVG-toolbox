The first frame depicts a snowy street scene at night. Three pedestrians walk away from the viewer in the foreground, with another person visible to their far left, also walking away. To the left stands a white kiosk under festive lights, while a building adorned with string lights and snowy outdoor seating occupies the midground on the right. The background shows more buildings and trees illuminated with white festive lights against a dark sky.

The three central figures continue walking away from the first-frame viewpoint down the snowy path. Other pedestrians emerge from the left side of the scene, moving past the original camera position and further into the distance. The snowy ground underfoot becomes increasingly tracked with footprints as the figures advance, revealing more of the street ahead.

The first frame depicts three individuals walking away from the viewer on a snow-covered urban street at night. To the viewer's left stands a building with a visible 'N' logo and storefronts, while to the right, a restaurant's outdoor seating area is illuminated by string lights. Further down the street, trees decorated with white lights and more pedestrians are visible in the distance.

In subsequent frames, the three foreground people continue walking further away from the viewer along the snowy path. As they move, more of the distant snow-covered path and additional pedestrians further ahead are progressively revealed.

The first frame depicts a snow-covered pedestrian path at night, illuminated by numerous lights. In the immediate foreground, two individuals in dark winter clothing and backpacks walk away from the viewer, one on the left and another slightly to their right. The midground reveals a larger crowd of people walking further ahead on the path, bordered by storefronts and outdoor dining areas brightly lit with warm lights on the right, and smaller illuminated structures and trees adorned with white decorative lights on the left, all receding into the distance under a dark sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint advances steadily forward along the snowy path. The two individuals initially in the foreground continue walking away, gradually shifting leftward within the frame. The illuminated buildings and decorative trees on both sides slowly move from the midground towards the foreground and then off-screen, creating the impression of the viewer walking past them. The scene continuously reveals more of the path and distant buildings ahead, with no entirely new objects appearing from previously unseen areas.
