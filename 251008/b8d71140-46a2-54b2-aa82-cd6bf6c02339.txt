The first frame displays a paved pedestrian street flanked by shop-lined buildings, featuring a wooden planter with greenery in the bottom right foreground and another centrally located further down. On the left, 'OFFICE' and 'Oliva' shopfronts are visible alongside a red telephone box, while 'Accessorize' and 'Typo' line the right, all leading to a distant square with a red umbrella and trees. end of description
As the camera subtly zooms in and moves forward, the foreground planter gradually exits the frame downwards. Concurrently, shop signs evolve: on the right, 'Typo' disappears, revealing 'Accessorize' more clearly with its 'A' logo, while on the left, 'OFFICE' is replaced by a prominent red 'Lululemon S' logo. The lone person previously seen on the left side of the street continues walking further away from the first-frame viewpoint.

In the first frame, a paved pedestrian street extends away from the viewer, flanked by multi-story buildings housing shops. To the immediate right, a planter box filled with yellow and purple flowers is visible. In the midground, a wooden planter box sits centrally, while a person walks away from the viewer on the left side, past a red telephone booth and a Lululemon store. On the right, an H&M store and another shop displaying a 'SALE 70% OFF' sign are present. In the background, an open area features red umbrellas, small kiosks, and a large green tree.

As the frames progress, the person on the left in the midground consistently moves further away from the viewer down the street. They approach, then pass the central wooden planter box on its left. The person continues to recede into the distance, eventually reaching the area in the background with the red umbrellas and kiosks.

In the first frame, a paved pedestrian street extends towards the background, flanked by buildings. A wooden planter with various plants occupies the bottom right foreground. To the viewer's left, black-fronted shops, including 'Lululemon', line the street, while a similar 'H&M' store is on the right. In the midground, a man walks from the center-right towards the left, positioned beyond the planter. Further left, a red, flower-decorated telephone booth stands, and centrally, a circular planter with a tree and two red umbrellas is visible with buildings and a clear sky in the background.

end of description

The man initially in the midground, center-right, progressively walks towards the viewer's left and further into the scene, carrying a bag in later frames, eventually exiting the frame towards the viewer's far left. Concurrently, a person previously partially obscured behind the red umbrellas in the midground, center-right, becomes more visible, sitting near the circular planter, gradually shifting slightly rightwards relative to their initial first-frame position.
