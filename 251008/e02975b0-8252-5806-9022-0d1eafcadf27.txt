A street extends directly forward, lined by buildings on both sides. On the immediate left, a black pickup truck is parked, followed by a white pickup truck, a person standing nearby, and then several other parked vehicles, all bordering a sidewalk with trees and multi-story brick and cream-colored buildings. On the right, a long black construction barrier with orange traffic bollards runs parallel to the street, with multi-story brown buildings visible above it in the distance. Further ahead, tall city buildings are visible under a clear sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances forward down the street, objects on the left, starting with the black pickup and the person near the white pickup, move past the viewer and out of frame to the left. Concurrently, the black construction barrier on the right continuously shifts past the viewer, revealing new segments of the street and buildings further along the right side. All foreground objects recede, while previously distant vehicles and buildings on both sides become progressively closer and move towards the edges of the frame.

The first frame presents a straight view down a city street, with a white pickup truck parked on the immediate left and a black construction barrier with an orange cone on the immediate right. Multi-story buildings, including a prominent brown one with balconies on the left, line both sides of the street, which extends towards distant city skyscrapers visible against a light blue sky. Further down the street, additional parked cars, storefronts, and streetlights are visible on both sides.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the white pickup on the left and the construction barrier on the right progressively recede and move out of view. Consequently, new sections of the street, including additional parked cars, storefronts, and a white sign structure revealed behind the receding barrier, become visible and move closer from the front. Pedestrians and a scooter on the left side of the street also become more prominent as the viewpoint advances.

The first frame shows a city street extending into the distance, lined with buildings and trees under a clear sky, with a white car parked on the left and a silver pickup truck on the right in the foreground, and other vehicles and pedestrians visible further down the street.
end of description
The white car on the left moves forward and completely out of the frame, revealing a parked motorcycle and a 'STOP' marking on the road directly in front of the viewer's original position. Simultaneously, a 'STOP' marking previously obscured by the pickup truck on the right appears on the road. The pickup truck then begins to move forward and recedes down the right side of the street into the mid-distance.
