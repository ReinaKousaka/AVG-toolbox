An elderly couple, seen from behind, walks away from the viewer down a paved pedestrian street lined with shops. To the couple's right, "DAS SYRISCHE RESTAURANT" has visible outdoor seating with patrons, while a glass pedestrian bridge spans the street in the distant background.
end of description.
As frames progress, the couple continues walking further down the street, remaining central to the view as the camera appears to follow them. This reveals more distant shop fronts on both sides and dynamic movements of numerous other pedestrians, some approaching and others receding from the original viewpoint.
