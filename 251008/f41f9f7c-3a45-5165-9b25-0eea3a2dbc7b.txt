frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a winding asphalt road in the foreground, curving towards the left, with a steep rocky mountain and a light blue guardrail to its left. To the right of the road are a concrete barrier, a grassy incline, and a large blue billboard framed in red, while numerous pointed karst mountains are visible in the distant background under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the rocky mountain face and the light blue guardrail on the left to appear closer and recede slightly. Simultaneously, the large blue billboard on the right side of the road draws nearer and becomes more prominent within the frame. The distant karst mountains remain visible but become less dominant as closer objects expand, and a bridge structure and additional road signs on the left side of the road become clearer as the viewer approaches them.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a winding road ahead, bordered by a rocky mountain face and a light blue guardrail on the left, and a lower concrete barrier with a vegetated hill on the right. Distant mountains punctuate the horizon under a clear blue sky, while a large, weathered blue billboard with a red frame is partially visible on the far right, and a yellow warning sign appears further along the right barrier.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the large blue billboard on the far right to recede and exit the frame to the right. Simultaneously, the yellow warning sign on the right and other distant road signs on the left become increasingly larger and closer to the viewer, passing by the prominent rocky mountain and vegetated hill.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a winding asphalt road with double yellow lines, leading into a mountainous landscape under a clear blue sky. Steep, rocky mountains, partially vegetated, flank the road; a light blue guardrail runs along the left side. On the immediate right slope stands a yellow rectangular warning sign with Chinese text, while a cluster of smaller traffic signs is visible in the mid-distance ahead.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the road, the initial yellow sign on the right moves out of view to the right, and the distant cluster of traffic signs approaches and shifts slightly left relative to the first-frame's center. Concurrently, a new large blue rectangular sign, indicating weight and height limits, appears to the right of the approaching central sign cluster. Further along the winding road, a tunnel entrance becomes visible on the far left mountain face.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a two-lane road curving gently left, flanked by a concrete barrier on the right and a guardrail on the left, leading into a mountainous landscape. A steep, tree-covered mountain rises on the left, revealing a tunnel entrance in the mid-distance, while a rocky slope is on the right. In the midground on the right, a large blue sign indicating weight limits stands, with a pole featuring multiple warning signs (downhill slope, general warning, speed limit '40') further along the road. The background reveals a vast mountain range with a bridge structure spanning a valley under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the large blue sign on the right recedes out of view. Concurrently, the cluster of warning signs on the pole further down the road become more prominent, revealing an updated yellow sign displaying "8.6 km" above the downhill icon and changing the red circular sign from a '40' speed limit to a winding road symbol. These signs then also move off-frame to the right, replaced by a new yellow sign warning "Tunnel ahead, slow down" on a separate pole, now positioned more centrally on the right side of the road. Simultaneously, the tunnel entrance on the left becomes progressively closer, with a white car emerging from it in the final frames.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a mountain road curving to the right, viewed from a forward perspective. To the left, a large, green, rocky mountain features a tunnel entrance with a white car visible just outside it, further along the road. A concrete barrier lines the right side of the road, beyond which a valley and distant mountains are seen, including a multi-arched bridge structure further ahead to the right. Prominently in the mid-right, a yellow road sign instructs "Tunnel ahead, slow down, drive carefully" in Chinese, all under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, the yellow sign moves further right relative to its initial position, eventually disappearing from the frame. The white car, initially near the tunnel ahead and to the left, gradually approaches the viewer. Concurrently, the tunnel entrance itself draws closer, while the distant mountain ranges and bridge, initially in the far right, slowly shift leftward across the horizon due to the road's curvature.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a multi-lane road curves right from the foreground, leading towards a tunnel entrance carved into a rocky, tree-covered mountain slope on the left. A white van drives towards this tunnel, while to the right, a concrete barrier overlooks a valley featuring a distant multi-tiered viaduct spanning rugged mountains under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The white van continues driving away from the first-frame viewpoint, steadily approaching and then entering the tunnel entrance. As the camera moves forward, the tunnel and the distant viaduct on the right appear to draw nearer to the fixed first-frame viewpoint. By the final frame, the van has completely disappeared inside the tunnel.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a two-lane road with double yellow lines leading towards a tunnel entrance carved into a large, rocky mountain on the left. To the right, a concrete barrier runs along the road, with a multi-tiered bridge structure visible in the middle distance ascending another mountain under a blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the tunnel entrance, roadside streetlights, and warning signs become successively larger and closer, with objects near the viewer's path eventually moving out of frame. The distant bridge and mountains on the right become less prominent as the immediate approach to the tunnel dominates the scene. The tunnel's facade, including a mural on the left and signage above the archway, reveals more detail as the viewer draws nearer.
