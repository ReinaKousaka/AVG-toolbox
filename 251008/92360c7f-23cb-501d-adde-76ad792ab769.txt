The first frame shows a street in the foreground with three buildings: a central two-story hair salon featuring a prominent sign, glass door, and two display windows, flanked by a white residential-style building to its left and another lighter building to its right. In front of the salon, a red cone sits on a green mat, while overhead utility wires span the top of the scene.

Following this, the barber pole sign attached to the right side of the central building activates, its red and blue stripes spinning and illuminating. Subsequently, a person holding a white umbrella walks from right to left across the street, emerging from the right side of the frame and passing in front of the white building. Finally, a yellow train appears on tracks behind the white building, moving from left to right across the mid-ground.
