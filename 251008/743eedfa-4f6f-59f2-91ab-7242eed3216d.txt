A woman in a dark dress appears on the far left sidewalk, walking towards the background, as a man also moves along the right sidewalk into the distance. The white SUV in the immediate right foreground moves out of view, revealing more of the silver SUV behind it and the storefronts to its right. The woman on the left continues walking further into the scene before nearing the left edge of the frame, as the scene otherwise maintains its composition.

A street extends from the viewer into the distance under a clear sky. On the immediate right, a gray van and red car are parked, followed by a line of vehicles alongside multi-story brick buildings featuring a streetlamp and a "Speed Limit 20" sign. On the left, a wide sidewalk with numerous green trees features a "Public Parking" sign and a person walking away from the viewer, with a modern glass building and an outdoor seating area further left. More distant buildings and a white car are visible at the end of the street.
end of description
Across the subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly advances forward and pans slightly to the right relative to the initial position. The person on the left sidewalk continues walking further away and slightly to the left from the first-frame viewpoint. Consequently, the gray van on the right exits the frame, revealing more of the red car and the vehicles parked behind it which now appear closer to the center of the first-frame viewpoint. More of the outdoor seating area and the glass building on the left become visible as the viewpoint shifts right.

The first frame depicts a sunny street scene with a clear blue sky overhead. On the left, a sidewalk features several green-leafed trees and an outdoor cafe area with numerous white tables and chairs, some occupied by people, and a white sign towards the foreground. A street runs through the center of the frame, bordered on the right by a row of multi-story brick buildings, including a prominent reddish-brown one with white trim and arched windows, alongside which cars are parked.
end of description
The viewpoint gradually shifts forward and slightly to the right throughout the frames. The outdoor seating area and trees on the left progressively move out of the frame's left edge. Concurrently, more of the street ahead and buildings further down the block on the right, including a section with blue umbrellas outside a commercial establishment, are increasingly revealed towards the center-right of the frame. The parked cars on the right gradually shift their position within the frame as new details of the street and adjacent architecture become visible.

A street scene on a sunny day features a wide road leading into the distance, with parked and moving cars visible. To the viewer's right in the foreground, parts of a white SUV and a dark grey minivan are visible, alongside a white barrier with red slats. Further right, a multi-story brick building with fire escapes, an "BBQ SMOKE SHOP" sign, and outdoor seating with yellow umbrellas and blue chairs is present. To the left, several green-leafed trees line a sidewalk where an outdoor cafe with white tables and chairs hosts several people, and a bicycle is parked. The background shows more buildings and dense green foliage under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the camera moves forward and slightly to the right, the foreground vehicles shift to the front right of the initial viewpoint, and a new dark blue car becomes partially visible in front of them. More of the "BBQ SMOKE SHOP" storefront and its outdoor seating are revealed to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, extending further down the street. Simultaneously, the outdoor cafe on the left moves progressively out of view towards the left and rear of the initial perspective, emphasizing the forward motion along the street.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, the viewer looks down a street bordered by buildings and trees under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left, leafy green trees partially obscure a light grey building with a dark opening, next to a sidewalk featuring bike racks and a trash can. On the right, a multi-story brick building with fire escapes houses a "BBQ SMOKE SHOP" with a prominent neon sign and an outdoor dining area fenced by red barriers, containing closed yellow and blue umbrellas. Further down the street, a white car is parked on the left, and a light-colored SUV is driving away on the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer slowly moves forward along the street. The "BBQ SMOKE SHOP" sign on the right recedes, revealing more of the outdoor dining area where people become visible to the right of the viewer. Concurrently, the trees on the left pass by, exposing more of the grey building facade and unveiling a red fire hydrant on the left sidewalk. The distant light-colored SUV continues moving further away from the viewer, while the overall scene shifts to reveal more of the street ahead.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a street looking forward, with trees, a trash bin, a fire hydrant, and bicycles on racks positioned on the left sidewalk. A multi-story brick building with prominent fire escapes lines the right, while an outdoor dining area with yellow umbrellas and a person walking away from the viewer occupy the foreground right. A white SUV is parked on the street ahead, with more buildings and cars visible in the distance under a clear sky.
end of description
Chronologically, the person on the right sidewalk proceeds to walk further away from the viewer, passing the parked white SUV, until they eventually move out of the frame to the far right.
