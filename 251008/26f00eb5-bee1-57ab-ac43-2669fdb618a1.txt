The first frame presents a picturesque valley scene, framed by a traditional dark-roofed wooden building on the immediate left and a reddish-brown building on the immediate right. In the midground, green grassy hillsides dotted with houses and industrial structures, including a blue train car, lead up to a massive, tree-covered grey cliff face, with distant snow-capped mountains visible under a clear blue sky.

end of description

A blue train car, initially visible in the midground slightly left of the central valley structures, moves steadily to the right across the lower part of the scene. It continues its progression horizontally, gradually disappearing off the far right edge of the frame, revealing the tracks and additional industrial infrastructure previously behind it.
