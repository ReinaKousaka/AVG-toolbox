The viewer is on a city sidewalk under a white scaffolding tunnel, positioned behind two women walking away, one in a plaid coat slightly left of center and another in a dark coat to her right; ahead, numerous pedestrians are visible, while a building with large glass windows and a sun-like emblem stands to the left, and a street with distant vehicles and buildings is to the right.
end of description
As the viewpoint slightly advances, people continuously move towards and away from the viewer within the tunnel and along the street. A blue bike share station and an "Order Pickup" sign on a stand become more prominent to the right, emerging from the background relative to the initial frame. Subsequently, a man holding a cup approaches from the left foreground, while a smiling blonde woman also moves into the left mid-ground, both coming towards the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
In the first frame, a bustling city street scene at night is visible from a pedestrian's perspective. In the immediate foreground to the left, a blonde woman with a smile is partially seen, walking towards the viewer. Behind her and slightly to the right, a woman with a ponytail in a plaid coat faces away, walking forward, with another woman in dark clothing beside her. Numerous other pedestrians occupy the mid-ground and background, walking in both directions under a long white scaffolding structure that covers the walkway. To the far left, a building with large windows and a decorative sunburst design on a pillar is visible. To the right, an orange "Alumni Serves Order Pickup" sign with an arrow is present, and further right, a green bike lane with blue rental bikes and city buildings in the distance can be seen.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the blonde woman in the foreground moves completely out of view to the left of the first-frame viewpoint. The two women in the mid-ground, initially facing away, continue walking forward and further away from the first-frame viewpoint within the scaffolding tunnel. Pedestrians in the background and mid-ground dynamically move, with some new individuals entering the scene from the deep background (straight ahead) and others passing the first-frame viewpoint to the right and left, maintaining the busy flow under the scaffolding. The street, buildings, and bike lane to the right of the first-frame viewpoint remain largely static as the human traffic progresses.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a bustling urban night scene under a bright white scaffolding tunnel that extends directly ahead into the distance. In the immediate foreground, a woman wearing a plaid-patterned coat is positioned center-left with her back to the viewer, while another woman in a black jacket and dark hair is center-right, also facing away. To the left of the foreground woman, several other pedestrians are visible, some facing the viewer, others walking forward. Along the right side, beyond the scaffolding, a street with a line of blue bicycles and distant multistory buildings with lit windows is visible.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward through the scaffolding tunnel. The two prominent women in the foreground continue walking away from the viewer, with the one on the right gradually moving towards the viewer's right and eventually exiting the frame. More pedestrians appear further ahead within the scaffolding, as others previously visible in the midground also advance directly forward. The row of blue bicycles along the street to the right remains visible, with their position shifting slightly relative to the moving viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a nighttime urban street scene from a pedestrian's perspective, looking down a walkway enclosed by a prominent white scaffolding structure. In the immediate foreground, the backs of two individuals are visible to the left and right of the viewer. Further down the walkway, multiple pedestrians are visible, some walking away from the viewer (notably a woman in a long dark coat and another in a tan coat), and others approaching on the left side. To the left of the walkway is a building with a golden facade, while to the right, a street features parked blue bicycles, distant vehicles, and multi-story buildings.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera moves forward along the scaffolded walkway, causing the pedestrians walking away to recede further into the distance and those approaching to grow larger and closer to the first-frame viewpoint. Additionally, vehicles on the street to the right subtly change their positions, indicating ongoing traffic movement relative to the evolving viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows the viewer looking forward down a city sidewalk at night, covered by an extensive white scaffolding structure that forms a tunnel. To the viewer's right and slightly behind is the back of a person, mostly obscured. Several individuals are walking away from the viewer down the sidewalk, with two women prominent in the midground center. To the left is a building facade, while to the right, beyond the scaffolding, lies a green bike lane next to a street with parked bicycles and visible cars, buildings, and traffic lights in the background.

end of description

As the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk, the person initially to the viewer's right moves out of frame, and the people ahead of the viewer gradually move further into the distance. The scaffolding structure continually shifts, revealing more of the streetscape to the viewer's right, including passing cars and additional sections of the buildings on both sides. New individuals periodically enter the frame from behind the viewer, walking forward along the sidewalk, demonstrating continuous pedestrian flow through the urban environment.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays an urban night scene on a sidewalk covered by an extensive white scaffolding structure, extending overhead and to the left. In the immediate foreground, the back of a person wearing a black jacket with an orange collar is visible, walking away from the viewer. Ahead and to the left, several other pedestrians also move away under the scaffolding, while to the right, a street with a white limousine and other vehicles, alongside a bike lane with blue rental bikes, stretches into the background.
end of description
As the viewer's perspective moves forward, following the lead person, the scaffolding and building facades shift within the frame. Pedestrians continue walking both on the sidewalk and across the street, while vehicles proceed on the street to the right. A traffic light located in the mid-distance, to the right of the scaffolding, changes from an indistinct state to red.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows the back of a person's head and shoulders in the immediate foreground, facing away from the viewer. To the left, a long white scaffolding structure covers a sidewalk, under which multiple pedestrians walk away from the viewer. To the right, a street features a green bike lane, with several vehicles like a white truck and white SUV further down, and pedestrians crossing from the right. Tall, dark city buildings and streetlights, including a red traffic light, line the background.
end of description
As the viewpoint subtly advances, pedestrians under the scaffolding on the left continue moving away. On the street to the right, a black SUV drives forward and turns left across the intersection, revealing a person in a yellow vest near its original position. A yellow taxi becomes visible behind the scaffolding on the far left, while other vehicles and pedestrians on the right side of the street also progress forward, clearing the crossing.
