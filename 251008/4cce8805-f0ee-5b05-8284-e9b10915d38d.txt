In the first frame, a bustling street scene unfolds with numerous people occupying the foreground and midground, standing or walking on the sidewalk and street directly in front of the viewer. Dominating the midground is a large brownstone building with steps leading up to an illuminated entrance, adorned with various Halloween decorations including ghost figures on the steps and a purple witch-like figure on the right-side window. A red fire hydrant stands in the mid-right foreground, and a baby stroller is visible further right. To the left, another lighter-colored building is partially visible, while trees and more distant buildings recede into the background under an overcast sky.

Throughout the following frames, the crowd in the foreground and on the brownstone steps continuously shifts and moves, with individuals in the mid-right foreground appearing to record the scene with a phone. A small child in a white costume becomes more visible walking towards the viewer in the right foreground. A white object is seen descending from the upper part of the brownstone steps, falling towards the ground directly in front of the steps. Subsequently, a person in a light-colored full-body costume moves from the left mid-ground, passing the fire hydrant towards the right foreground. The white object eventually lands on the ground near the base of the steps amidst the ongoing pedestrian movement.
