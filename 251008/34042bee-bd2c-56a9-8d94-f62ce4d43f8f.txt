A city street scene is depicted with a prominent black A-frame sign for "Relaxing Spa" on the right, next to a light blue doorway. To the viewer's left, an outdoor dining structure contains a seated person, while another individual in a black shirt stands facing slightly away. A sidewalk stretches forward, bordered by parked cars and trees on the left, and buildings with blue trash bins on the right, leading to distant urban structures.
end of description
The person in the black shirt gradually moves forward, away from the viewer, walking along the sidewalk. This movement allows the white Audi SUV parked behind them and to the left to become more fully visible, without revealing any new scenes or objects.

In the first frame, a street scene unfolds with a person in a black shirt and cap positioned in the left foreground, their back to the viewer, near a green-topped structure. To their right, a white SUV is parked on the street, followed by a row of other cars extending into the distance, separated from the viewer by a bare-branched tree. On the right, a sidewalk runs parallel to the street, lined with blue and black trash bins against a building facade. Buildings with varied architecture stretch along both sides of the street into the background, where a white delivery truck is visible.
end of description
The person on the left begins to move, turning slightly and walking away from the viewer, becoming partially obscured by the white SUV. They continue to move towards the left, eventually disappearing entirely behind the white SUV from the first-frame viewpoint. No significant new objects are revealed as the person exits the frame.

The first frame depicts a street scene from a sidewalk viewpoint. To the left, a partial silver car is visible in the foreground, facing away, while a tree trunk stands prominently on the sidewalk. To the right, a cream-colored building lines the sidewalk, fronted by several blue and dark trash bins and white barriers. Down the street, several parked cars (including a white sedan and a dark SUV) and a white delivery truck are visible on the left, with more buildings across the street.

end of description

A white delivery truck and a black sedan, positioned down the street to the left, slowly move forward. Concurrently, a white sedan and a dark SUV, also on the left, shift forward. The silver car in the immediate foreground on the left also advances slightly. An air conditioning unit, previously obscured by the window frame, gradually becomes visible in a window of the building to the right.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A street scene is visible with a white Mercedes sedan parked on the lower left, next to a paved sidewalk extending into the distance. On the immediate right, several dark-colored trash bins are lined against a light-colored building, which features an air conditioning unit in a window. A bare-branched tree stands on the sidewalk near the center, with additional parked cars and a large white delivery truck further down the street to its left. Colorful triangular flags are strung across the street on the right, leading to older buildings, while modern structures are seen in the left background under a blue sky.
end of description
A lone pedestrian, initially in the distant background, slowly advances on the right-side sidewalk towards the viewer. No other significant dynamic changes or new objects are revealed across the subsequent frames.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The foreground right shows stacked black trash bins, while a blackboard sign and a bare tree, adorned with colorful bunting, occupy the mid-ground sidewalk. To the mid-ground left, a white car and a dark blue SUV are parked on the street, with urban buildings and a distant white truck receding into the background under a blue sky.
end of description
As the camera subtly pans right, the white car on the far left exits the frame, and the trash bins on the far right gradually move partially out of view to the right. Simultaneously, a previously unseen section of the building facade and sidewalk becomes visible further to the right of the original viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
First, the initial frame displays a city street with a dark blue SUV parked on the left sidewalk next to a tree, an orange construction barrel further down, and a black A-frame sign on the sidewalk to the right, in front of a brick building adorned with colorful triangular flags strung overhead.
end of description
As the camera pans right, objects like the white car (bottom-left), blue SUV, tree trunk, orange barrel, A-frame sign, and trash cans (bottom-right) progressively move out of view to the left of the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, more of the brick building's facade on the right side, including additional windows and a clearer "OPEN" sign inside the rightmost storefront, is revealed, with the "WEED WORLD CANDY" sign becoming more prominent above it, bringing these new elements into the right side of the frame.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a black A-frame sign with white lettering stands on the sidewalk in the immediate foreground to the viewer's right, positioned in front of a dark storefront with a purple "OPEN" neon sign. Above the storefront, colorful bunting flags hang, extending towards the left. To the viewer's left, a large bare tree partially obscures two parked SUVs on the street. Centrally on the sidewalk, a striped orange and white construction barrel encircles another bare tree. Further down the street in the midground, several people are visible near a crosswalk, with buildings and parked cars lining the street into the background.
end of description
The A-frame sign, initially in the foreground to the viewer's right, progressively rotates and moves backward and to the right, eventually being completely lifted and removed from the scene by the seventh frame. Its departure reveals more of the sidewalk and the lower facade of the storefront where it previously stood. No other objects are newly revealed or undergo significant dynamic changes.
