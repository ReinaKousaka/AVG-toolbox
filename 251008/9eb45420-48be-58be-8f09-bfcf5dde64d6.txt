In the first frame, a wide street stretches away from the viewer, flanked by multi-story buildings adorned with numerous advertisements and towering skyscrapers in the background under an overcast sky. On the left, a sidewalk features pedestrians, a street lamp, and a traffic light displaying a green signal. On the right, further down the road, a cyclist in a green helmet and orange vest rides past several large, dark dump trucks parked along the curb, beneath another traffic light also showing green.

The cyclist steadily moves away from the viewer, receding further down the street towards the right side. Simultaneously, the traffic light on the right, further along, changes from green to yellow. Following this, the traffic light on the left also transitions from green to yellow. As the cyclist progresses, more of the stationary dump trucks' extensive bodies and details, including a prominent 'G' logo on the rearmost truck, become increasingly visible along the right side of the road.

The first frame shows a city street receding into the distance under an overcast sky, lined with buildings on both sides. In the foreground to the right, the cab and front wheels of a large black dump truck are visible. A cyclist on a bicycle, wearing a helmet and backpack, rides in the mid-ground next to the truck. An orange construction sign with a right-pointing arrow and several orange and black traffic barrels are further down the street on the central yellow line. On the left, buildings feature signs such as "TOKYO SMOKE" and "WINNERS," with pedestrians on the sidewalk, while tall skyscrapers fill the background.

The large black dump truck on the right moves away from the viewer, gradually revealing its blue dump bed and rear. Concurrently, the cyclist continues riding forward along the street. New storefronts like "BURGERS FIVE GUYS" and "SILVER SNAIL" become visible on the left side, and additional orange and black traffic barrels appear further along the right side of the street.
