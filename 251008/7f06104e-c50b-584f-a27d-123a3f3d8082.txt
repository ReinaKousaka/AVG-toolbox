The first frame displays a rainy night street scene with a wet, reflective sidewalk and a lamppost with a bicycle sign on the left foreground, alongside a dark SUV with bright headlights driving on the wet road towards the viewer in the midground, while distant buildings, streetlights, and a pedestrian with an umbrella are visible in the background.

Subsequently, the initial dark SUV continues to move to the viewer's right and exits the frame. Various other vehicles then appear from the distant left, driving towards the viewer along the wet road. These cars, including a white convertible and a dark sedan, also pass by on the viewer's right, their tires creating prominent splashes of water as they move.

The first frame depicts a rainy night street with a decorative lamppost in the center-left foreground, a wet sidewalk extending left, and a glistening road marked with '50' to the right. A dark sedan with bright headlights is blurred mid-motion across the road from the right, while green traffic light reflections and distant buildings are visible in the background.

Chronologically, the initial dark sedan continues moving left and exits the frame. Subsequently, a black SUV enters from the right side of the road, traveling past the lamppost towards the left, while another car with red taillights becomes visible further down the road on the right.

The first frame displays a nighttime street scene from a low vantage point beside a wet sidewalk. To the immediate right, a brown, ornate pole with a partial white sign is visible, marked 'Rain Everyday' in the upper right corner. The foreground left features a wet, textured tiled sidewalk with a yellow tactile paving strip. A wide, dark asphalt road, reflecting green and red traffic lights and numerous streetlights, occupies the midground, with faint white road markings and several distant cars with active lights. In the background, buildings with illuminated windows line both sides of the street, flanked by trees, all under a dark night sky.

In subsequent frames, the static viewpoint reveals dynamic traffic movement on the wet street. A black car with prominent red taillights appears in the mid-distance on the right side of the road from frame 3, slowly moving forward and eventually away from the viewer. Concurrently, a white car with red taillights becomes visible emerging from the far right of the first-frame viewpoint in frame 6, progressively moving towards the viewer. This white car advances closer, eventually occupying the immediate right side of the road relative to the viewer's original position, reflecting strongly on the wet asphalt before exiting the frame to the right. The myriad reflections from vehicle lights and streetlights continually shift and shimmer across the saturated road surface throughout the sequence.
