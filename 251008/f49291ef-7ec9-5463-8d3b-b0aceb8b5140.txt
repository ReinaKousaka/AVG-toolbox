The first frame features a large bronze statue of a cowboy wrestling a bull on a stone pedestal, positioned slightly right of center in the foreground on brick-patterned ground. Behind a white and orange fence, green grass extends towards a multi-story building with a red tile roof and arched windows on the midground's left. Further right, another building adorned with flags and an orange truck are visible, alongside a partial tree trunk.

As the frames progress, the camera slowly pans left, gradually revealing a wooden gazebo-like structure and more of the brick ground on the far left. A road with parked dark vehicles becomes visible further left behind the fence, while the orange truck and the building with flags on the right side move out of view.
