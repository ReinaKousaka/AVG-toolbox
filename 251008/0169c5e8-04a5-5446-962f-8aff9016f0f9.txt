frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame depicts a paved road, marked with a yellow double-line, extending uphill and curving right into the distance, flanked by a large dark mountain on the left and a grassy hillside on the right. A metal guardrail runs along the lower left beside the road, and a green road sign is visible in the far distance, centered above the road. The sky above is mostly cloudy, with patches of blue visible.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the road surface's cracks and markings to shift towards and beneath the viewer. The guardrail on the left recedes and moves out of the frame, while the distant green road sign slowly approaches, becoming slightly larger and clearer relative to its initial position. The surrounding mountains and hills on both sides progressively recede towards the edges of the frame as the viewer advances.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays an asphalt road leading away from the viewer, bordered by a steep, dark green mountain on the left and a gentler, grassy hillside on the right. A green road sign is positioned above the road in the mid-distance as it ascends, with a cloudy sky overhead and distant mountains on the horizon.
end of description
From frame 4, a dark animal appears on the right hillside, initially far in the distance next to the road. Over subsequent frames, this animal progressively moves closer to the viewer and descends the grassy slope. By frame 8, another light-colored object, possibly a large rock or sheep, becomes clearly visible further down and to the right on the hillside, as the dark animal continues its approach towards the viewer's current position.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a paved road extending from the bottom center into the distance, flanked by a steep, green mountain on the left and a brownish-green, grassy slope on the right. A dark-colored animal grazes on the right slope in the mid-ground, while further ahead on the right, two road signs are visible by the roadside. The sky, filled with white and grey clouds, dominates the upper half of the frame.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, the animal on the right slope appears closer and moves slightly towards the viewer and further to the right, continuing to graze. White crosswalk markings gradually become visible on the road surface in the foreground, directly below the viewer's path. The distant road signs and mountains slightly increase in perceived size as the viewer moves forward along the road.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a two-lane asphalt road with a single yellow center line and white shoulder lines, ascending slightly and curving gently to the right, flanked by green, rocky mountains under a cloudy sky. A large green overhead sign with a smaller blue sign beneath it is visible in the mid-distance above the right side of the road, with more distant mountains appearing between the foreground peaks.
end of description
A white pedestrian crossing swiftly appears on the road in the foreground, closer to the viewer than the overhead sign. Subsequently, several dark-colored cows emerge on the grassy slope to the right of the road, positioning themselves between the pedestrian crossing and the overhead sign. Simultaneously, a new yellow warning sign appears on a pole on the right side of the road, closer than the overhead signs. The cows continue to graze and shift their positions on the right slope, some moving slightly closer to the road.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a paved road with a central yellow double line and white shoulder lines extends from the viewer into the distance, featuring a pedestrian crossing on the bottom left. Flanking the road are green mountains to the left and a drier, grassy hill to the right, where several cows graze near a blue rectangular sign. Above the road, a large green overhead sign is supported by a metal gantry, with an additional blue sign placed lower on the right pole. The sky above is largely cloudy, and a guardrail runs along the left side of the road in the mid-distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the large green overhead sign and the smaller blue sign on the right gradually ascend and exit the frame, with the grazing cows on the right slope simultaneously receding from view. A new blue rectangular sign becomes visible on the left side of the road, positioned behind the guardrail, as the viewer approaches it.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a paved two-lane road with a yellow center line, curving gently to the right, leading towards distant mountains under a cloudy sky. To the left, a silver metal guardrail runs alongside the road, separating it from a river valley with green slopes. Behind the guardrail, a blue sign with a white '6' is visible. To the right of the road, a tall blue sign featuring icons for mountains, trees, water, an arrow, a 'P' for parking, and text '观景台 viewing platform' stands prominently.

end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the blue viewing platform sign on the right rapidly moves out of the frame to the viewer's right. Simultaneously, the blue sign with the '6' on the left recedes and exits the frame to the viewer's left. The road ahead continues to curve right, revealing more of the immediate grassy hillside to the right and the extended mountain ranges directly ahead in the background. The guardrail and river valley on the left continue to recede into the distance relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a paved road with a broken yellow center line and a solid white right edge line, curving rightward into the midground. To the left, a metal guardrail parallels the road, beyond which a steep, green-sloped mountain rises, with glimpses of distant peaks and a valley floor. On the right, a rugged, vegetated mountain slope ascends, featuring exposed rocks. Overhead, a cloudy sky with patches of blue stretches across the scene, and a thin pole is visible near the distant curve of the road.
end of description
As the frames advance, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the road, causing the immediate surroundings to recede. A white vehicle then appears from around the right curve of the road, moving towards the viewer on the right side of the road relative to the initial viewpoint. This vehicle steadily approaches, passing the slender pole visible in the first frame.
