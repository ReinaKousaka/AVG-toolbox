From a first-person perspective, the viewer's ungloved left and gloved right hands grip the handlebars of a red bicycle, which has a central display. A wet asphalt road stretches ahead, defined by central white double lines, and a right lane marked "ONLY" with an arrow. To the left, a pedestrian path with bare trees contains several people walking rightward, including one in a yellow jacket, one in a dark coat, and another in a dark top with blue jeans, accompanied by a small dog. In the distant background, more leafless trees, buildings, and a cyclist in a yellow jacket are visible along the curving road under an overcast sky.
end of description
The people on the left pedestrian path continue to move across the frame and gradually exit to the left of the first-frame viewpoint. As the bicycle progresses forward along the road, a pedestrian crossing symbol becomes visible on the pavement to the left. Simultaneously, the "ONLY" text and arrow on the right lane shift from ahead to beneath the viewer, while the distant yellow-jacketed cyclist appears slightly closer.
