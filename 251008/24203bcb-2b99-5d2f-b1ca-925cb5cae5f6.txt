In the first frame, a thick, dark gray pole with white flower decals is prominently positioned in the foreground to the right, partially obscuring a white and black zebra crossing which extends across the midground. To the left of the viewer, a wet concrete sidewalk borders a road, featuring another dark pole with traffic lights and a green directional sign. A black SUV is seen driving from left to right in the midground on the wet asphalt road, which is marked with white lines and a large yellow box containing text; further down the road, another vehicle is partially visible on the far left. In the background, green trees line the road, with multi-story buildings visible beyond them under an overcast sky, as rain visibly falls.

Subsequently, the black SUV in the midground continues moving towards the right across the intersection, while a black compact van emerges from the left lane, behind the traffic light pole, and drives forward across the yellow marked box. The previously partially visible vehicle on the far left, an older sedan, also moves further into the scene and then exits the frame to the left. Rain continues to fall steadily, causing visible splashes on the wet road surface as vehicles pass.
