The first frame displays a rainy night scene on a city street. In the foreground, a large bare tree trunk stands prominently to the left of the viewer, with its branches extending upwards. To its right, a wet sidewalk reflects the glow of multiple streetlights, extending into the midground where a dark trash bin and more bare trees are visible. Further to the right, a building facade mirrors the streetlights and a faint red glow. To the left of the tree, a wet asphalt road stretches into the distance, reflecting streetlights and distant traffic signals. In the background, tall city buildings with illuminated windows pierce the dark sky. A "Rain Everyday" watermark is in the top right.

A white delivery van appears on the wet road to the mid-left, moving away from the viewer, followed shortly by a second similar van. Simultaneously, two electric scooters become visible, parked on the wet sidewalk in the mid-left, near the trash bin. Over the subsequent frames, additional scooters appear, increasing their number to at least five in the same location.

The first frame shows a nighttime city street, wet from rain, extending into the distance. On the left foreground, several electric scooters are parked on the sidewalk, which reflects bright streetlights. Further left, a large tree with bare branches stands next to a street sign, with a busy road and buildings beyond. To the right, a modern building with large glass windows reflects the street scene. In the background, a tall, illuminated skyscraper is visible under a dark sky, with more streetlights fading into the distance.

The camera slowly moves forward along the wet sidewalk. As the viewpoint advances, the cluster of electric scooters on the left side gradually shifts from the mid-foreground towards and eventually out of the left edge of the frame. Simultaneously, the large tree and street furniture on the left recede into the background, while the modern building on the right side shifts more prominently into the foreground, revealing more of its facade. The visible stretch of the street ahead expands as the perspective progresses forward.

From the viewer's perspective, a dark, rainy city street scene unfolds. On the immediate left foreground, several white electric scooters are parked on a wet sidewalk. To their right, a bare-branched tree stands beside a dark, rectangular bin. The street itself, to the left of the tree, is wet and reflects distant lights. On the right, a large, reflective building facade and a grey kiosk occupy the foreground. The wet sidewalk extends into the mid-ground, mirroring streetlights and building lights, while tall illuminated buildings line both sides of the street in the background.

In the mid-ground, a person holding an umbrella appears from the distant background and walks away from the viewer along the wet sidewalk. Shortly after, a dark car with illuminated taillights drives from left to right across the mid-ground street. Later, another person carrying a white object briefly emerges on the far left, near the street, walking towards the viewer before exiting the frame. The constant rain and shimmering reflections on all wet surfaces persist throughout.
