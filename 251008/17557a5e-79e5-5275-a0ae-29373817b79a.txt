The first frame shows a mountain road with the asphalt stretching ahead of the viewer. To the left, in the oncoming lane, a silver car is followed by a dark grey SUV and a red car further behind them. A metal guardrail runs along the left side of the road, beyond which is a dense, green forested slope. To the right, a stone retaining wall supports a steep, bright green grassy hillside leading up to another dense forest. Distant hazy mountains are visible in the background under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the road, causing the landscape to recede. The silver car, followed by the dark grey SUV and then the red car, sequentially approach and pass the viewer on the left side of the road. A black and white roadside marker emerges and recedes on the right, while a small, light-colored structure becomes visible further ahead on the left side of the road.
