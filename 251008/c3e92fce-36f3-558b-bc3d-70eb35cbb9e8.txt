In the first frame, a man in a blue shirt and beige pants walks away from the viewer on a tiled sidewalk to the left, next to a red fire hydrant and circular sign. A paved street with a white stripe extends into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings; a dark gray "Kaito BLD" is on the right, and a white car is parked further down the street on the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily moves forward along the street. The man, fire hydrant, and sign progressively recede and exit the left side of the frame relative to the initial viewpoint. Consequently, the buildings on both sides and the white car in the mid-ground grow progressively closer to the viewer's new position.

The first frame captures a tiled street extending forward under a clear blue sky, flanked by buildings. To the viewer's immediate left, a man in a blue shirt walks away on the sidewalk, past various buildings and a white van; on the right, a dark building with a roll-down door is visible, and a white car is parked further down the street. end of description. From the first-frame viewpoint, the camera gradually moves forward along the street. This causes objects previously further down the street, like the white car on the right, to appear closer, while the man, initially walking away on the left, continues to recede further from the original viewpoint and eventually exits the scene; subtle shifts in shadows also occur.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a paved street receding into the distance with a white dashed line down its center, flanked by buildings; on the right, "BISTRO Uketto" is visible on a dark building in the near foreground, next to a lighter building with multiple storefronts and a silver car parked in front of it, while a large light pink building and a white van are visible further down on the left.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves consistently forward, the "BISTRO Uketto" sign and the area immediately to the right in the first frame progressively shift out of view to the right and eventually become behind the original first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the silver car on the right and the white van on the left, initially in the mid-ground, appear to approach the viewer's current position, thus moving further back relative to their initial placement in the first frame as the scene advances past them.
