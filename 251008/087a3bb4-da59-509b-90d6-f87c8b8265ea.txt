The first frame displays a paved road stretching into the distance under a clear blue sky, bordered by a dense line of large, leafy green trees on the left and a row of multi-story buildings with varied architecture on the right. A grassy area lies to the left of the road, with faint glimpses of more buildings and parked cars beyond the trees, while a black SUV is partially visible in the bottom right foreground, to the viewer's right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road; the black SUV on the right moves further right and eventually exits the frame. Objects previously ahead, such as a dark grey parked hatchback on the right and other distant vehicles, become closer to the viewer's original position as they are approached and passed. The trees on the left and buildings on the right steadily move towards and then past the viewer, revealing more distant portions of the street ahead, including a prominent red traffic light on the far left.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a sunlit street with a continuous row of tall, green-leafed trees lining a grassy median on the left, behind which buildings are partially visible. To the right, a sidewalk borders a series of distinct residential buildings featuring various architectural styles, with a black car parked curb-side closest to the viewer and other vehicles visible further down the road, all under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the street, causing the black car on the right to recede and eventually move out of the frame. This forward motion reveals more of the houses and their fencing further down the street on the right side, while the row of trees on the left also continuously shifts past the viewer. Buildings further in the distance on both sides of the street become more prominent before also moving past, indicating continuous progression through the scene.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a tree-lined street under a clear blue sky. On the left, a long row of tall, verdant trees borders a grassy area, with other buildings and parked cars faintly visible further down the street behind them. On the right, a paved sidewalk runs alongside a fence, behind which stand several distinct multi-story buildings, including a prominent yellowish building with a red roof and a dark grey building with a dormered roof closer to the viewer. Several cars are parked along the right side of the street.

The viewpoint moves steadily forward along the street, revealing more of the road and surroundings *ahead* of the initial position. Objects previously in the mid-ground, like the trees on the left and the buildings and parked cars on the right, move progressively towards the *rear* relative to the original viewpoint and eventually out of frame. New sections of the treelined park and the street on the left, and more of the fence and houses on the right, including parts of the yellow building, are continuously revealed *further along* the street. Specifically, the grey building on the far right moves out of view, and a street lamp on the left side passes by the viewer.

The first frame shows a tree-lined street with a grey road extending forward, flanked by a row of tall green trees on the left and parked cars alongside buildings on the right. A prominent yellow building with a red roof stands further down on the right, with a silver minivan parked in the foreground on the right and a lamppost on the far left.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the silver minivan on the right quickly moves out of frame, revealing more parked cars that were previously further down the street. The yellow building on the right also recedes and moves off-screen to the right, unveiling additional buildings with balconies further along the street to the right of the original viewpoint. Concurrently, the trees on the left and the lamppost on the far left move past the viewer, exposing more of the park area and additional trees further down the road.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a paved street extends from the foreground into the distance under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's immediate right, the rear of a black car is partially visible, followed by a line of parked cars including a silver van and a white car. Beyond these vehicles, ornate, multi-story buildings with unique roofs and balconies line the right side of the street. To the viewer's left, a wide grassy median or park area is filled with numerous mature trees boasting lush green foliage, also stretching into the distance, with distant buildings peeking through.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses forward along the street. The black car initially in the foreground on the right quickly recedes and exits the frame to the right of the first-frame viewpoint. The parked silver van and the white car, originally further down the street on the right, progressively draw closer to the first-frame viewpoint. The tree-lined path on the left and the buildings on the right continuously pass by, moving towards and eventually behind the original first-frame position, revealing more of the street ahead.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a tree-lined street under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's right, a white hatchback car is parked facing away, with a dark SUV parked behind it, and more vehicles visible further down the road. On the left, a continuous line of mature trees with dense green canopies borders a grassy area. Beyond the parked cars on the right, several buildings are visible, including a prominent house with a dark roof and a decorative turret-like structure.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the viewer moves forward along the road. The white hatchback on the right drives away, exiting the frame, which then reveals the dark SUV that was previously behind it in greater detail. As the viewer continues to advance, the SUV also proceeds forward and eventually exits the frame to the right, while the trees on the left and buildings on the right progressively reveal more distant sections of the street.
