The first frame depicts a pedestrian sidewalk on the left, where several people walk away from the viewer, alongside a rocky slope. To the viewer's right, a black SUV with a roof cargo box drives quickly left on a road, which is separated from distant buildings by a white barrier, with karst mountains in the background.
end of description
The black SUV quickly exits the frame to the left, revealing more of the road ahead. Subsequently, a silver scooter enters the frame from further down the road, driving towards the viewer on the right side, as pedestrians continue their movement away from the viewpoint on the left.

The first frame depicts a street scene with people walking away from the viewer on a left-side sidewalk alongside a rocky slope. A white scooter moves down the central road, which is lined on the right by a barrier and multi-story buildings with shops, all set against distant karst mountains under a grey sky.
end of description
Subsequently, the white scooter continues moving away from the viewer, while a new scooter with a black canopy enters from the mid-right, moving closer on the road before exiting the frame to the lower right. Simultaneously, a silver van appears in the mid-distance on the road, steadily approaching the viewer's first-frame position.

In the first frame, several pedestrians walk away from the viewer on a sidewalk along the left, bordered by a rocky, tree-covered slope. To the right of the sidewalk, a two-lane road extends into the distance, with a light-colored van driving away from the viewer in the right lane. On the far right, a row of multi-story buildings with numerous windows lines the street, separated by a low barrier adorned with flower planters; more pedestrians and activity are visible along this side. In the background, distinctive karst mountains rise prominently against a cloudy sky, with blue road signs visible further down the street.
end of description
The light-colored van moves further away from the viewer, eventually exiting the frame to the right. Concurrently, a pink scooter, initially visible in the mid-distance, approaches the viewer along the road, then drives past the first-frame viewpoint towards the foreground right. The pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue to walk away from the viewer, maintaining their general positions relative to each other.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a street scene with a group of pedestrians walking away from the viewer on a sidewalk along the left, bordered by a rocky, tree-covered hillside. To the right, a paved road extends into the distance, on which a pink scooter with two riders is positioned in the midground, also moving away from the viewer. Along the right side of the road, a barrier with planters precedes a row of multi-story buildings, while distinctive karst mountains rise prominently in the far background under an overcast sky.
end of description
In the following frames, the pink scooter continues to travel away from the viewer down the road, progressively appearing smaller and further into the distance. Simultaneously, the group of people on the left sidewalk slowly proceeds forward, moving away from the viewer's initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a group of people is walking away from the viewer on a sidewalk to the left, with the closest person in a light blue jacket and orange hoodie in the immediate foreground. To their left, a lush green, foliage-covered wall extends into the midground. A utility pole stands near the sidewalk on the left, further down. To the right of the sidewalk, a two-lane road stretches into the distance, with a white line marking a bike lane, and a distant motorcycle is visible heading away. On the far right, a protective barrier with flower planters separates the road from a row of multi-story buildings featuring large, blue-tinted windows and various storefronts, with other vehicles parked further down the street. In the far background, a large, prominent green mountain rises under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The group of people and the utility pole on the left gradually move past the initial frame's left edge and out of view, revealing more of the foliage-covered wall and sidewalk behind their original positions. Simultaneously, new sections of the street and the urban environment, including more parked vehicles and storefront details, become visible further ahead on the right side of the road. The distant mountain and the main buildings on the right remain largely in their positions relative to the first-frame's depth.
