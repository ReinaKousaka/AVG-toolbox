The first frame shows a paved village street receding towards distant mountains under a clear blue sky, with a bright sunburst in the upper right. To the viewer's left, several multi-story houses with gabled roofs are visible behind a grassy area and a wooden fence, with a dark car partially obscured further down the street. On the right, a house and a carport with a car are present next to the road.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward down the street, causing the wooden fence and the closest house on the left to recede and eventually move out of frame to the viewer's left. A manhole cover appears on the road closer to the viewer, and cars previously partly obscured, such as the dark SUV on the left, become fully visible as the scene progresses.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
A sunny village road stretches forward, bordered on the left by a light-colored house with a black car and on the right by a brown-roofed building with an evergreen tree, all beneath a bright blue sky with the sun and distant mountains visible in the background.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the immediate foreground elements on both sides recede and move out of view. A street light pole on the left and a person walking on the road, initially ahead and to the left of the center from the first-frame viewpoint, become progressively more prominent and closer. The village buildings and distant mountains ahead continue to fill the frame as the perspective moves forward.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a paved road extending from the bottom center into the distance, flanked by buildings and trees under a bright blue sky with the sun high on the upper right. To the viewer's immediate left, a tall evergreen tree and a streetlight pole are visible, with a house behind the tree and a dark sedan parked further down the road. To the viewer's right, a large building with a dark roof is close by, with two parked cars (one red, one lighter) further down. In the mid-distance, a person walks on the left side of the road, and mountains are visible in the far background.
end of description
The viewer progresses forward along the road, causing the initial streetlight and evergreen tree on the left to move out of view. The person walking in the mid-distance on the left side of the road slowly approaches the viewer, moving towards the center of the frame. As the viewer advances, more houses and fences are revealed to the left, including scaffolding on one building, while a "no entry" sign appears on the right. The vehicles on both sides of the road also appear larger and closer, indicating forward motion.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A person walks left-of-center on a sunny street, with a parked black car behind them and a white house with scaffolding further left; to the right, a yellow house and a partially visible red car line the road leading towards distant mountains under a bright sun.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the person exits the frame to the left, revealing more of the black car still parked on the left. The red car, initially on the right, becomes fully visible before also moving towards the left side of the frame as the viewer passes it. The yellow house on the right disappears, while a streetlamp on the left side of the road is approached and then passed, with the distant mountains remaining in view ahead.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a paved village road extending forward under a bright blue sky with a high sun, flanked by a steep forested hillside and houses on the left, and a paved parking lot with a red SUV on the right, leading towards distant snow-capped mountains. A streetlamp is visible in the upper left foreground, and wooden fences line both sides of the road.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances forward, the streetlamp exits the upper left, while the red SUV on the right recedes further into the mid-ground relative to the initial position. Concurrently, a dark grey car emerges from the left foreground, gradually becoming prominent as earlier visible houses on that side also recede. The overall scene progresses deeper into the village, consistently revealing new sections of the road and more distant buildings from the initial perspective.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a paved road stretching into the distance under a bright blue sky with a prominent sun glare in the upper right. To the viewer's immediate left, a dark grey car is partially visible, followed by a stone wall and wooden fence, behind which stands a building with a dark roof. On the right, a paved parking area with white lines is present, flanked by a bare tree and a large beige building. Further along the road, various other buildings line both sides, and distant mountains, partially snow-capped on the far right, form the backdrop. A street lamp and a blue 'P' sign are visible in the mid-distance on the right.

end of description

As the viewpoint progresses forward along the road, the dark grey car initially on the far left gradually recedes out of frame. Two pedestrians emerge from the mid-distance on the right side of the road, near the parking lot, moving towards the viewer's original position and passing the bare tree. The buildings on both sides, the bare trees, and the street lamp on the left become larger and more detailed, indicating the viewer's closer proximity to these elements relative to their first-frame positions. The scene continuously reveals more foreground details of the road and the architecture lining it as the movement continues.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a paved road extending into a village under a bright, sunny sky with the sun positioned high-right. To the viewer's left, a wooden fence precedes a grassy area and a multi-story building featuring a dark facade and red shutters. On the right, two people walk away from the viewer on a sidewalk next to a light-colored building and another wooden fence, with distant mountains visible in the background.

end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the two individuals on the right walk further into the distance and eventually exit the frame to the right. The light-colored building on the right side becomes more fully revealed, exposing a blue parking sign and subsequently, a parking payment machine. Simultaneously, the perspective on the left clarifies, showing a concrete barrier along the road and more details of the dark building and further village structures ahead.
