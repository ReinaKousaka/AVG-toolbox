A bright blue sky is visible at the top, partially covered by dark green tree branches in the upper left. A large, multi-storied white building with numerous windows and awnings occupies the right side, with a smaller, older white building featuring a turret further back and to the left of it. A paved path curves from the foreground towards the left, bordered by a grassy area with a fence and a distant body of water on the far left. A lone person walks on the path in the mid-ground, and a tall black streetlight stands to the right of the path. An on-screen display showing metrics like speed, grade, and distance is present in the top right.

The viewer moves forward, causing the large white building on the right to extend further into the frame, revealing more of its rightmost sections, which were initially obscured to the far right. The path ahead gradually curves more sharply to the right, causing the grassy area and distant body of water on the left to recede and eventually disappear from the left edge of the frame. The initial person walking on the path moves further ahead, while two new individuals subsequently appear from the left, walking along the path towards the viewer's original position, and the streetlight on the right also shifts closer to the viewer's center-right.

The first frame features a clear blue sky above a beige building with multiple windows and sunshades occupying the right side, while a wire fence on the left overlooks a body of water and distant hills. An asphalt path extends from the foreground into the midground, with two people walking away on its left side past orange barriers, and a large white building with a turret visible further back amidst trees.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the path. The two individuals recede further into the midground and then disappear, while a street lamp on the right becomes fully visible and subsequently moves past the viewer. Concurrently, the orange barriers on the left and stacked materials on the right disappear from view, revealing more of the white building and the distant water.
