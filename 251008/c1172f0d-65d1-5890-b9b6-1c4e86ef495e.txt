As the frames progress, the person on the far right shifts further right, revealing a woman in a light headscarf who emerges from the right side of the view and pauses, turning to look towards the viewer. Concurrently, a musician playing a guitar becomes fully visible in the midground, positioned centrally in front of the cafe entrance, entertaining the seated customers.

Across subsequent frames, the camera subtly zooms out and shifts slightly left, revealing more of the ornate white planter belonging to the potted topiary in the left foreground. Concurrently, additional tables and patrons on the left side of the terrace become visible, and a new table with drinks appears in the mid-ground, to the right of the topiary and closer to the viewer.
