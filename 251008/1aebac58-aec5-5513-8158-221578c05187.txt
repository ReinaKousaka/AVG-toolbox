The first frame depicts a narrow Japanese street scene, with buildings and utility poles lining both sides under a blue sky. Two pedestrians walk away from the viewer on the left sidewalk, while parked vans are visible on an intersecting street to the right.
end of description
As frames progress, the pedestrians and a scooter rider in the mid-background continue moving further down the street away from the viewer. The viewpoint subtly shifts right, revealing more of the intersecting street on the right and gradually cropping the leftmost building in the foreground.

To the immediate left, a light-colored building displays a yellow banner with a cartoon character and Japanese text, with an air conditioning unit below, and a vertical yellow banner stands in front of it. In the midground left, a woman in a plaid coat and a child walk away from the viewer down the street, while more buildings with various signs line the street's left side. To the midground right, a street lamp pole with a convex mirror is prominent, behind which several parked vans (white, black, silver) are visible next to a larger white building.
end of description
The woman and child, initially in the midground left, continuously walk further down the street away from the viewer. They gradually recede deeper into the scene as they proceed along the path. No new objects or scenes are revealed; only their movement is observed.

The first frame presents a street scene with buildings lining both sides under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left, a light-colored building wall features a closed corrugated metal shutter and a yellow and green sign with "宅急便 123 Cook" near the viewer's upper left, with a smaller blue sign below it and a blue bag resting on the ground. In the mid-ground left, two individuals walk away from the viewer along the sidewalk, past a purple "AEON" sign further down the street. On the right, a silver minivan is parked in the street, partially obscuring a smaller white van behind it, next to a utility pole holding a spherical mirror, a blue parking sign, and a sign with Japanese text. The street recedes into the background, populated by more buildings, utility lines, and distant pedestrians.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the two pedestrians previously in the mid-ground left consistently move further down the street, progressing deeper into the scene away from the viewer. Their position shifts from being just past the initial yellow sign to being notably more distant. No other objects or scenes are newly revealed; the vehicles and buildings remain static in their first-frame positions relative to the viewer.

The first frame captures a narrow city street receding into the distance under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left, a closed shop with a white roller shutter displays a red and green sign advertising "宅食 COOK 123" with images of fruit. Two pedestrians walk away from the viewer on the left sidewalk, while a silver minivan is positioned on the street, also facing away. On the right side of the street, a white van is partially visible next to a blue parking sign, with multi-story buildings and utility poles lining both sides of the thoroughfare.
end of description
The two pedestrians on the left sidewalk steadily progress forward and away from the viewer. The silver minivan in the mid-ground remains mostly stationary throughout the sequence. In frame 8, a person on a bicycle appears from behind the white van on the right, riding away from the viewer down the street. The cyclist then continues to move further into the distance, positioned to the right of the silver minivan.

The first frame captures a narrow urban street with buildings on both sides, topped by a clear blue sky. To the viewer's immediate left, a pole supports a white sign for 'COOK 123' in front of a fruit display, while a silver van and a lone cyclist proceed down the road, away from the viewer, positioned centrally and to the right, respectively.
end of description
Over subsequent frames, a white and pink PUDO kiosk is newly revealed on the left sidewalk, appearing next to the van's left. The cyclist, now clearly visible with a child seated in front, continues to move forward and eventually exits the frame to the right, while the silver van remains largely stationary in the midground.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a narrow street with buildings on either side, a large fruit-adorned sign on the far left, and a "PUDO" locker system nearby. A white van is parked mid-street, and a person on a bicycle with a child is moving away from the viewer on the right. end of description. The cyclist and child exit the frame to the right, while a woman in a long coat, mask, and hat walks into the scene from the left sidewalk, moving towards the viewer. The white van remains mostly stationary further down the street.
