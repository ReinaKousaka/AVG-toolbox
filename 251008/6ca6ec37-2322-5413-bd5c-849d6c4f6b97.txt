The first frame displays a person on a bicycle in the mid-left foreground, moving forward on a road where a black SUV and a blue/red truck are behind them. To the left stands a yellow building with balconies, while a sidewalk on the right features pedestrians and shops with red awnings, all framed by distant mountains in the background.

The cyclist, SUV, and truck all move forward, with the SUV eventually exiting the frame ahead of the viewer. A white car with a colorful design then emerges from behind the truck in the mid-left and drives past the viewer. Meanwhile, pedestrians continue moving forward on the right sidewalk.

A street scene is presented from a forward-looking viewpoint. A light blue and red truck is parked on the left side of the road, facing away from the viewer, with a yellow building featuring flags and balconies behind it and a green mountain in the distant background. On the right, a sidewalk lined with storefronts, trees, and two orange bollards extends into the distance, with people walking along it.
end of description.
As the perspective shifts forward, the orange bollards on the right move out of the frame. A red fire hydrant-like object, previously located further ahead on the right sidewalk, becomes fully visible. Additionally, a small white paraglider is newly revealed high in the distant sky, above the mountain range on the left.
