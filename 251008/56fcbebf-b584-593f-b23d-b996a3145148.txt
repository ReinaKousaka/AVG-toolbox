The first frame displays a wet city street on a rainy day, with part of a white polka-dotted umbrella visible in the top right. A prominent white-trunked tree and sidewalk are in the right foreground, while two grey light poles anchor the center midground of the asphalt road. To the right, a bus stop with a green bus and white van are positioned, flanked by modern buildings and several trees in the background.

The viewpoint subtly pans left and slightly forward, causing the umbrella to move out of view to the top right and the bus stop and vehicles to gradually exit the frame to the right. As the light poles shift leftward and the white-trunked tree moves towards the center-right, more of the wet road and the dark building on the far left become visible, revealing a wider perspective of the street ahead.
