The first frame presents a wet highway ahead with a pedestrian crossing, flanked by a blue guardrail, green hedge, and distant mountains with a red car and overhead signs to the left, and a blue guardrail alongside a tree-covered hill to the right. end of description. As the viewpoint progresses, the red car and a subsequent large red truck move forward on the left, passing the first-frame's position, while the initial overhead signs and distant mountains recede. The foreground pedestrian crossing passes beneath, revealing a stone wall on the right and an electrical tower emerging further left, all relative to the first-frame's position.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a wet asphalt highway receding into the distance under an overcast sky, featuring a crosswalk directly in front of the viewer, a blue guardrail and green hedge to the left, and a stone retaining wall bordering a tree-covered hillside to the right. An overhead gantry sign is visible in the upper left, while distant misty, tree-covered mountains and a power line tower are discernible in the background.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the initial crosswalk and the gantry sign in the upper left move out of view behind and to the left of the first-frame viewpoint, respectively. The road, blue guardrail, and stone wall continuously pass by the first-frame viewpoint, revealing new segments of the highway ahead. The previously distant overhead road signs steadily approach, growing larger as they move closer to the first-frame viewpoint, with the power line tower eventually disappearing to the left.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The viewpoint progresses along a wet, two-lane highway marked with white lines, leading towards distant green mountains under an overcast sky. Blue guardrails flank the road, with dense foliage left and a stone retaining wall right, all beneath an overhead gantry displaying multiple road signs in the mid-distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the overhead gantry and its signs pass directly above, revealing a green directional sign beneath it, both eventually moving behind the viewer's position. A red truck briefly appears on the far left, behind the left guardrail, before the surrounding green landscape recedes as the journey continues straight ahead.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a wet asphalt highway receding into the distance under an overcast sky, bordered by blue guardrails on both sides. To the left, dense green foliage covers a hillside with a power line tower in the mid-distance, while on the right, a large green highway sign indicating destinations like "Zheng'an 3km" and "Chongqing 167km" stands against a tree-covered slope. A bridge or overpass spans the road in the far distance ahead.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the highway sign on the right moves closer to the viewer before passing out of the frame to the *right of* its initial position. Simultaneously, a textured stone retaining wall on the right hillside becomes increasingly visible, appearing *closer* than where the sign was initially located. The distant bridge and the power line tower on the left also appear to move *closer* to the viewer from their original positions.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a wet asphalt highway extending forward, gently curving to the right in the distance, with white dashed lines marking the lanes. To the left, a blue guardrail separates the road from dense green bushes and trees, with a tall transmission tower visible further back on a hill, and a bridge spanning a valley in the far distance under an overcast sky. On the right, a vegetated concrete retention wall parallels the highway, displaying a green directional sign near the middle distance.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the highway markings, the blue guardrail, and the dense green foliage on the left continuously emerge from the distance, passing the viewer. Concurrently, the concrete retention wall, the green directional sign, and the adjacent greenery on the right are progressively revealed as they approach and then recede past the viewer. The distant bridge and misty mountains remain in view, indicating the ongoing journey along this highway.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a wet asphalt highway receding into the distance under a cloudy sky. To the viewer's immediate left, a blue guardrail runs parallel to a thick green hedge, while on the right, an embankment featuring a stone wall and various green foliage includes a small green chevron sign. Further ahead, a bridge arches over the highway, and a tall electricity pylon is visible on the far left amidst distant green hills.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the highway; the blue guardrail, green hedge, and stone embankment with the chevron sign recede to the sides and out of view. Consequently, more of the surrounding green hills become newly visible on both sides as the scene advances. The bridge in the distance steadily grows larger, indicating the viewer's approach.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a wet asphalt highway extending forward from the viewer, featuring a dashed white center line and a solid white line on the right shoulder, alongside a blue guardrail on the far left. An arched pedestrian bridge spans across the road in the mid-ground, nestled between green, tree-covered hills; a darker rock face is prominent on the right. A green directional arrow sign is visible on the right shoulder further ahead, under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the highway, the dashed center line, solid right shoulder line, and blue guardrail continuously approach and pass beneath or alongside the viewer. The green directional arrow sign on the right shoulder draws nearer, followed by white Chinese characters painted on the road surface that progressively appear from the distance. These characters reveal the full message '禁止占用应急车道' (No occupying the emergency lane) as they pass under the viewer. Simultaneously, the arched bridge ahead becomes increasingly prominent, while the adjacent green embankments and dark rock face recede past the sides of the view.
