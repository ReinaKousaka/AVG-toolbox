The first frame captures a city street at dusk, featuring an outdoor dining area with empty tables and chairs in the foreground left, adjacent to an illuminated Burger King and McDonald's building. A wide sidewalk with a bare tree and lamppost parallels a wet street on the right, where cars with headlights recede into the distance, with ornate buildings in the far background.

Throughout subsequent frames, a woman in a grey coat walks further away from the viewer along the sidewalk, while a man in a dark jacket appears on the far right and also moves away from the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, vehicles on the wet street continue to travel further into the background.

The first frame presents a city street at dusk, with empty outdoor restaurant seating on the lower left, followed by illuminated McDonald's storefronts and a burger advertisement on the sidewalk. A woman in a light coat walks towards the viewer on the mid-ground sidewalk, bordered by bare-branched trees, while further down the street on the right, vehicle headlights and distant ornate buildings are visible under the twilight sky.
end of description
The woman on the sidewalk continues walking towards the viewer, eventually drawing closer to the foreground left and revealing she's holding a cup. Concurrently, the man walking away on the street's far right side persists in his movement. A scooter then emerges from the right side of the street, traveling away from the viewer, followed by a white car further behind it, both receding into the distance.

The first frame presents an urban street at dusk, featuring a woman in a grey coat partially visible in the bottom left foreground, a Burger King sign on the sidewalk, and a McDonald's restaurant behind it. Bare trees line the sidewalk, with a man walking away from the viewer, while a street with cars runs parallel to the right, leading to a grand building in the background.
end of description
Subsequently, the woman in the foreground moves out of frame to the left, revealing more of the outdoor seating. Concurrently, the man on the sidewalk continues further down the street away from the viewer, and a dark car appears from the right to travel further into the background on the road. The overall viewpoint subtly shifts forward, expanding the visible storefronts to the left.

The first frame depicts a bustling street scene at dusk, with a brightly lit McDonald's on the left featuring an outdoor seating area, a large menu board in the immediate foreground, and covered umbrellas. A bare tree trunk stands prominently on the right sidewalk in the foreground, beyond which pedestrians walk away from the viewer. On the right, a black car moves along the street, parallel to more distant buildings and additional trees, all under a pale evening sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the black car on the street moves further away from the viewer, eventually followed by a lighter colored vehicle. Pedestrians on the midground sidewalk continue their progression down the street, moving away from the viewer's position. Most notably, a new individual wearing a light brown jacket and a white hat with a large pom-pom enters the frame from the far right, walking leftward across the foreground, partially obscuring the tree trunk before moving further into the scene.

The first frame captures a twilight street scene with the back of a person in a brown winter coat prominently in the immediate foreground, slightly to the right of center. To the left, an outdoor seating area with several people dining is visible next to a brightly lit McDonald's, while further along the sidewalk, other pedestrians are walking. On the right, a tree trunk borders the pavement, and a car and another pedestrian move away into the distance on the wet street.
end of description
The foreground person moves forward, progressively revealing more of the sidewalk where additional pedestrians, including a woman in a grey puffer coat and another in a white coat on the phone, walk towards the viewer. Simultaneously, a white car continues to drive away from the viewer on the street, and the tree trunk on the far right gradually exits the frame as the viewpoint advances.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a city street at dusk, with a woman in a grey coat on the far left foreground walking right, past an outdoor cafe area. Further back on the sidewalk, a woman in a white coat talks on her phone, with brightly lit "HOTEL LONDON" and "UGC" storefronts behind her, while a tree and lamppost in the mid-center separate the sidewalk from a wet street where a white car approaches the viewer on the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the foreground woman in grey moves right and exits the frame, and the woman in white continues walking right, gradually disappearing and revealing a green McDonald's sign on the far left of the foreground. The white car on the street proceeds past the initial viewpoint, while other pedestrians on the midground sidewalk continue moving further away.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The viewer is on a city sidewalk at dusk or evening. To the far left, a partial green sign is visible, followed by a row of buildings featuring "HOTEL LONDON" and a "UGC" cinema with movie posters on its facade. Several pedestrians are walking away from the viewer on this left sidewalk. To the immediate right, a large tree trunk and a metal trash can are present, with more bare trees lining the right sidewalk further into the scene. Beyond this, a street stretches into the distance with various vehicles, including a motorcycle and cars with illuminated headlights, moving away from the viewer. Distant, ornate buildings line both sides of the street, fading into the background.
end of description
Pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue moving away from the viewer. The motorcycle on the road in the mid-ground proceeds further into the distance. A person on a bicycle then enters the frame from behind the foreground tree trunk on the right, riding along the road away from the viewer. Subsequently, a white car appears further down the street, also moving away from the first-frame viewpoint.
