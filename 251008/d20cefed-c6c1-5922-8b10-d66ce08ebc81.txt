The first frame displays a street scene with an overcast sky. To the viewer's right, the front portion of a white SUV is parked, while a black SUV approaches from the middle-left, driving on the road towards the viewer. A long, light-colored stone building with multiple windows dominates the right side and background, beyond which a silver car is parked on a distant side street to the left. Further left, a sidewalk with a yellow pole and some trees are visible in the background.

The black SUV steadily drives forward, moving closer to the viewer from the center-left. It then proceeds to pass the viewpoint, continuing its trajectory towards the far right of the frame. The white SUV on the right remains stationary throughout the sequence, with no other significant changes in the background.

The first frame displays a street scene with a dark SUV partially visible in the bottom right foreground, closest to the viewer. To its left, a wet asphalt road extends into the distance, bordered by a sidewalk on the far left. A large, weathered stone building with numerous white-framed windows lines the right side of the street, while smaller stone buildings and a large evergreen tree are visible further down the street on the left, with a silver car parked there.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the dark SUV rapidly moves forward and out of view to the right, clearing the foreground where it was initially positioned. No other objects or scenes change dynamically relative to the first-frame viewpoint; all buildings, trees, and the distant parked car remain stationary.

The first frame displays a street scene with a paved road curving to the left. On the right, a large multi-story stone building with white-framed windows extends into the distance, featuring an "Abbey House" sign. To the left, a sidewalk and sparse vegetation lead to a yellow "St. Ann Lane" sign, followed by more stone buildings and a parked silver SUV in the midground, with tall trees visible behind. end of description. In the subsequent frames, a white car appears in the far distance on the left side of the road and steadily moves closer towards the viewer, becoming larger as it progresses into the midground.
