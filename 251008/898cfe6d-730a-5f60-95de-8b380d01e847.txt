The first frame shows a wet cobblestone street, reflecting light, stretching into the distance under an overcast sky. On the left, a building displays "CHLOSTI ESPANOLA BAR" with outdoor seating visible further along. The right side features a grand stone building with multiple arches, carved stone heads above them, a blue information sign, and a red 'no entry' sign prominently on the far right. Two individuals are in the foreground: one person in a black coat with a black umbrella is walking away from the viewer, slightly left of center, and another person with a backpack and a pink-patterned bag stands nearer the right building, also facing away from the viewer. In the midground, a distinctive red and white half-timbered building is visible, and other distant figures with umbrellas suggest ongoing rain.
end of description
From the initial viewpoint, the person with the black umbrella steadily walks away down the wet street, moving towards the distant buildings. Concurrently, the person with the backpack and bag proceeds forward, remaining to the right and slightly behind the umbrella holder. As they walk further into the scene, both individuals recede into the midground, progressively revealing more of the street and background structures that were initially less clear.
