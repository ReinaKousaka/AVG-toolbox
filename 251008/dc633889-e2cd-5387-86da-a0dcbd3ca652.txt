The first frame depicts a formal dining table, seen from a low angle, lavishly set with crystal glasses, silver tableware, light green napkins, plates, and floral centerpieces, with a silver candelabra and a small vase of flowers prominently in the mid-ground, and paintings and a white statue visible against the pale pink wall in the background.

The camera then slowly pans right and subtly upwards from this initial viewpoint. This movement progressively reveals more place settings on the far right of the table, a tall vase with green foliage, and a bright window with peach curtains further to the right of the initial frame's extent, along with a golden wall sconce that was previously partially obscured.
