frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame shows train tracks stretching into the distance, curving right, bordered by concrete structures with metal railings. To the left, a steep, tree-covered hillside rises, and to the right, a snow-dusted forest slopes towards distant snow-capped mountains, with text identifying "Mülitobel Brücke".
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the tracks, the concrete structures on both sides extend further into the view ahead, while the initial section of the bridge on the left recedes behind the viewer. This movement continuously unveils new sections of the steep, green hillside to the left and the snowy forest to the right, revealing more of the landscape further down the track from the first-frame viewpoint. Overhead power line structures also become progressively visible further ahead along the track.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows train tracks extending centrally from the viewer into the distance, curving gently to the left. To the viewer's left, a rising grassy slope with bare trees and utility poles is visible, with a metal guardrail in the bottom-left. To the right, a concrete platform and metal railing parallel the tracks, beyond which lies a forested, snow-dusted slope leading to distant snow-capped mountains under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the train moves forward, the immediate scenery on both sides rapidly recedes. The grassy slope, bare trees, and utility poles on the left continuously pass by, moving from the mid-left to the bottom-left. Simultaneously, the concrete platform, metal railing, and forested slope with snow patches on the right move backward, from mid-right to bottom-right. New sections of the tracks and adjacent landscapes emerge ahead of the viewer, while the distant snow-capped mountains and cloudy sky in the background appear relatively stationary.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, train tracks curve slightly to the left, receding into the distance from the bottom center. To the left of the tracks is a verdant, sloping hillside with bare and evergreen trees topping the crest, featuring a utility pole with overhead wires. To the right, a gentler, brown and sparsely vegetated slope runs alongside the tracks, partially obscured by a low barrier, beyond which bare trees and snowy patches lead up to distant, snow-capped mountains under a bright, partly cloudy sky.
end of description
As the train moves forward, the immediate trackside scenery, including the grassy hill on the left and the protective barrier on the right, rapidly approaches and passes out of view to the respective sides of the viewer. Utility poles on the left also continuously appear from ahead and move past the viewer. The distant snowy mountains remain largely stationary ahead, though their perspective subtly shifts as the train navigates the gentle curve.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, train tracks extend from the bottom center into the distance, curving towards the left. A grassy, tree-covered slope rises to the viewer's left, with a utility pole and overhead wires visible above the tracks. To the viewer's right, a lower, sparsely treed slope with patches of snow recedes, revealing distant snow-capped mountains under a partly cloudy sky.

end of description

As the train moves forward, the tracks beneath the viewer continuously recede, and the adjacent landscapes on both sides progressively advance from the background towards and past the first-frame viewpoint. Utility poles and wires on the left side steadily emerge from the distance and move past, while the distant snow-capped mountains remain relatively stationary in the far background. The immediate slopes reveal new sections of grass, bare trees, and sporadic patches of snow as the journey continues.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents train tracks extending directly forward, curving slightly left into a valley flanked by hillsides. To the left, a green grassy slope with bare trees and a utility pole ascends, while a lower, wooded embankment lies to the right, beyond which snow-capped mountains are visible under a bright sky in the distance.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the tracks, a small, light-colored concrete utility structure, initially positioned further along the tracks to the viewer's mid-left, gradually approaches and passes beside the viewer on the left, revealing graffiti on its side. The surrounding landscape, including the ascending grassy slope to the left and the wooded valley on the right with distant snowy peaks, continuously shifts, with previously distant sections moving closer and then receding behind the viewer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, train tracks extend from the foreground into the distance, centered in the lower half of the view. To the viewer's left is a steep, grassy hillside with some bare trees at its crest, while a narrower path runs parallel to the tracks on the right, bordered by more sparse, bare trees and a small concrete block. In the background, distant mountains, partially snow-capped, rise under a bright, slightly hazy sky, with overhead wires visible across the top.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the train tracks, causing the grassy hillside on the left and the path on the right to continuously advance towards and then recede past the viewer. The small concrete block on the right moves from the lower right foreground towards the center right and then disappears from view as the train progresses. The distant mountains and the receding tracks remain the central focus, while the immediate foreground scenery constantly changes.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays train tracks extending from the bottom center into the distance, flanked by a steep, grassy hillside with bare trees and a power line pole on the left, and a gravel path beside a dense forest on the right. In the far background, snow-capped mountains are visible to the right under a bright, hazy sky.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, causing the power line pole, the adjacent grassy slopes, and the trees on both sides to continually advance from the mid-ground and pass the viewer. The distant snow-capped mountains remain a relatively static feature in the far background.
