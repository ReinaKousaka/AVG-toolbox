The first frame depicts a mountain trail winding through grassy terrain under a clear blue sky, showing a person walking away from the viewer on the dirt path. In the background, majestic, tree-covered mountains rise, complemented by digital overlays displaying a vertical distance bar on the far left, an elevation profile on the lower right, and real-time activity metrics.

Across subsequent frames, the person on the path moves progressively further away from the viewer, while the white marker on the far-left vertical distance bar gradually ascends, and the marker on the lower-right elevation profile shifts to the right. Simultaneously, the real-time activity metrics in the bottom right corner, including pace and total time, continuously update.

The first frame shows a scenic mountainous landscape under a clear blue sky with two bright lens flares. A wide dirt path, extending from the immediate foreground, winds into the mid-ground, flanked by grassy slopes with sparse trees on the left, leading to dense forests, and a forested valley to the right. Several people are visible ahead on the path in the mid-ground, alongside a yellow signpost to the path's left. Rugged mountain peaks dominate the distant background. Informational overlay graphics are present in the viewer's immediate plane of vision: a vertical progress bar on the left, an elevation profile at the bottom, and various performance metrics (pace, speed, time) on the bottom right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the dirt path, causing the foreground to continually update. The yellow signpost on the left and the people ahead on the path appear to draw closer then gradually recede as the viewpoint advances. Concurrently, the overlay graphics update, with the yellow markers on the left-side progress bar and the elevation profile moving to reflect ongoing progress. The time, pace, and distance metrics on the bottom right also steadily increment and adjust, indicating continuous movement through the landscape.
