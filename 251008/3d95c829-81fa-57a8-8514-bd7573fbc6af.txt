The first frame captures a bustling outdoor market under a white awning, filled with numerous people on a paved walkway; a line of individuals stands along counters with red and white accents to the viewer's right, while others occupy the mid-ground and foreground, notably a person with a black jacket and backpack on the left.

As frames progress, the crowd subtly shifts, with some people moving out of view to the left and new individuals appearing from the far left and background. A woman in a light blue coat and white boots emerges from the far left and walks towards the right, while a person wearing a black coat, sunglasses, and a white mask, originally in the mid-center, turns their head to face slightly left.
