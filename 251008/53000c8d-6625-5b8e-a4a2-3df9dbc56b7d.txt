As the frames progress, the camera moves forward and slightly pans to the right. The man in the blue sweatshirt and the man in the maroon sweatshirt exit the frame to the left, revealing more of the market stalls on the left, now showing colorful accessories and watches. The woman in pink and the man in blue on the right continue walking forward, maintaining their relative positions, as a wider view of the market's mid-distance opens up. More market stalls, featuring hanging clothes on racks and additional merchandise, become visible further into the scene.
