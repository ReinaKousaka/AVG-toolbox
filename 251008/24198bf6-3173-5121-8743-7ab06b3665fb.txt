The first frame captures a twilight street scene from the perspective of someone walking on a city sidewalk. In the immediate foreground, the back of a blonde-haired woman in a white t-shirt and carrying a dark shoulder bag is prominent. To her left and slightly ahead, a dark-haired woman in a light pink top and dark pants holds a water bottle. Further ahead on the sidewalk, a man in a black t-shirt walks alongside a modern building with large, brightly lit display windows on the left, showcasing digital advertisements and interior lighting. To the right, a street separated by dark bollards features a dark SUV with illuminated headlights and other distant vehicles, all flanked by tall city buildings under a dusky sky.

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk; consequently, the blonde woman, the dark-haired woman, and the man in the black t-shirt recede further towards the background relative to the initial frame's position. New pedestrians, such as a man in a green shirt and another in a black t-shirt, emerge from the left side of the frame, from positions that were initially behind the viewer, and walk towards the background. The building facade on the left and the street scene on the right continually expand, revealing more of the path ahead that was previously in the mid-ground or background of the first frame.
