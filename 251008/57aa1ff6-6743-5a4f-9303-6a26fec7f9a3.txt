An aerial view presents a large white monastery or convent with a red-tiled roof, centrally situated on a dark rocky outcrop, surrounded by lush green foliage in the mid-ground. To the immediate left, a town with houses and streets stretches into the distance, while a wide blue bay with several boats lies beyond the monastery to the right. Across the bay, a city skyline with numerous high-rise buildings is visible in the background, backed by distant mountains under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly ascends and recedes, subtly zooming out to reveal more of the green hillside in the foreground and bottom-left. The white building, the bay, and the distant city across the water gradually appear slightly smaller as the camera gains altitude and distance. A small dark speck briefly appears moving in the upper right sky towards the end of the sequence.
