The first frame captures a wide street flanked by a row of buildings with white balconies on the left, where people gather at outdoor cafes, and a grassy park with scattered individuals on the right. The street extends into the distance towards an ornate white building, all under a clear blue sky, with a modern street lamp positioned prominently in the mid-right foreground. end of description. The camera then subtly pans to the right from the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, pedestrians previously visible on the left sidewalk continue moving forward and across the scene from left to right, passing through the mid-left foreground, while people within the park to the right also subtly shift their positions relative to the original viewpoint.

The first frame presents a sunny urban street scene with a wide paved area and a crosswalk in the foreground. To the viewer's left, a long building with distinctive white glass balconies (galer√≠as) stretches into the distance, with an active outdoor cafe beneath it. On the right, a green park with trees and people extends, bordered by two lampposts closer to the viewer, while in the background, an ornate white building stands prominently.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, pedestrians on the left sidewalk move forward, with a person pushing a stroller transitioning across the crosswalk from the left side towards the right. Other individuals continue walking along the left sidewalk and within the right-side park area, demonstrating subtle shifts in their positions relative to the initial viewpoint.

The first frame presents a wide, sunny urban pedestrian area under a clear blue sky. In the immediate foreground, a white-striped pedestrian crossing extends across a gray paved surface. To the viewer's left, a long street with multi-story buildings, some featuring traditional white glass-enclosed balconies and one partially covered in green scaffolding with a "PRADO" sign, lines a busy sidewalk where people are seated at outdoor cafes and walking, including a woman pushing a stroller and a child on a scooter near the mid-left. To the right, a green park with young trees and scattered people occupies the mid-ground. A wide paved promenade stretches into the background, revealing more buildings, notably a distinctive white structure with a tower, at the far end.

end of description

In subsequent frames, dynamic changes are subtle, primarily involving the continuous forward movement of people. The woman pushing a stroller and the child on a scooter, initially to the mid-left of the viewer, progressively advance along the sidewalk towards the background. Other pedestrians on the left sidewalk also move further into the distance. People within the park area to the right exhibit only minor shifts in their static positions, and no significant new objects or scenes are revealed relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

In the first frame, a wide street with a zebra crossing in the foreground stretches into the distance under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's left, a long building with many white-framed windows is visible, partially covered by green scaffolding featuring a "PRADO" banner, with people walking on the sidewalk and seated at outdoor cafe tables. On the right, a green park with young trees and streetlights runs parallel to the street, with several people standing within it, while in the mid-distance on the left, a prominent white building with a tower stands out. Near the left edge of the zebra crossing in the foreground, a woman pushes a stroller, and two children on scooters, accompanied by another woman, are poised to cross.
end of description
Chronologically, the group of individuals on the left foreground proceeds across the zebra crossing. The woman pushing the stroller moves forward, and the two children on their scooters follow onto the striped path, accompanied by the second woman. By the final frame, this group has advanced significantly further across the zebra crossing, moving from the left side of the frame towards the right.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a bright city street scene with a white striped crosswalk directly in the foreground. To the viewer's left, a long building with white balconies and partial green scaffolding lines a sidewalk bustling with people at outdoor cafes and walking, while a park with trees and streetlights occupies the right, leading to an ornate white building in the background. On the crosswalk, in the foreground-to-midground, are two children on scooters and a woman pushing a stroller, moving from left-center towards the right.
end of description
Chronologically, the woman with the stroller and the two children on scooters continue to cross the street, moving from the center-left across the crosswalk to further right of the first-frame viewpoint. The child initially on the far right of the crosswalk advances further right and slightly forward. Subtle forward movement is also observed among other pedestrians on the left sidewalk, further away in the midground.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a wide city square on a sunny day with a prominent crosswalk in the foreground. To the left, buildings with balconies and outdoor cafes line a busy sidewalk, while a park with young trees and more people occupies the right side. In the mid-ground, a woman on a scooter pushes a stroller, accompanied by a small child on a scooter to her right, both moving across the crosswalk towards the right. A distinctive ornate white building is visible in the far background under a clear blue sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the woman, stroller, and child continue moving across the crosswalk to the right, gradually exiting the frame on that side. Meanwhile, pedestrians on the far left sidewalk move towards and away from the viewer, while others in the park on the right show slight shifts in their positions, maintaining the sunny outdoor scene.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a wide urban square under a clear blue sky. In the immediate foreground, a white crosswalk spans the bottom, preceding a long grey paved street or pedestrian area extending into the distance. To the left, a multi-story building with numerous windows, partially obscured by green scaffolding and a 'PRADO' sign, fronts a pedestrian zone featuring outdoor cafe tables and people. On the right, a woman pushes a pink stroller on the paved area, adjacent to a park with young trees and scattered individuals, with a prominent ornate white building visible in the distant background.
end of description
The woman pushing the pink stroller, initially positioned on the right side of the crosswalk relative to the viewer, progressively moves further to the right in each subsequent frame. By the final frames, she and the stroller have entirely exited the scene to the far right of the original viewpoint.
