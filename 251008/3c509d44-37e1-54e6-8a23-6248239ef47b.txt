The first frame features two escalators in the foreground, with the viewer descending the right one towards a central landing area featuring an elevator door. To the right, a decorative pedestrian bridge with a balustrade extends, while a large, curved, light-brown building with multiple windows occupies the left midground. In the distant background, a cityscape with tall buildings and an Eiffel Tower replica rises under a clear sky.

As the frames progress, the viewer descends, making the central landing and the base of the left building appear closer and more visible. Simultaneously, the decorative bridge to the right draws nearer, eventually revealing several people walking on it, to the right of the viewer's path.
