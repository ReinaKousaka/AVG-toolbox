The first frame shows a paved path, dark reddish-brown, occupying the left and central-lower portion, curving gently to the right as it recedes into the midground. To the immediate right of the path, a wooden split-rail fence extends from the foreground towards the midground. Beyond the fence and further to the left, various trees with autumn foliage (yellow, light brown, and some bare) line the area, with a prominent bright yellow-leafed tree directly behind the fence on the right. In the far background, towering red rock formations are visible under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly advances forward, causing the paved path and the wooden fence on the right to move closer to the viewer. This movement reveals more of the path and the grassy area to the right of the fence, appearing as objects previously ahead of the first-frame viewpoint are now closer. The shadows cast by the trees on the path also shift slightly in perspective as the scene progresses.
