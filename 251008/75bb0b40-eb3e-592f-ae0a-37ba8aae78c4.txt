The first frame shows a paved road with white lines curving slightly to the left and extending forward from the bottom center. To the immediate right, a light-colored SUV is parked on a grassy shoulder next to a tall stone retaining wall, which rises into a steep, tree-covered mountainside. On the left, a metal guardrail runs alongside the road, backed by more trees and distant mountains under a blue sky.

As the viewer's vehicle moves forward, the parked SUV and the stone retaining wall quickly recede to the right and behind the viewer. The road continues its leftward curve, revealing more of the rocky, tree-covered mountainside on the right and an expanding view of distant mountains to the far left. A small white and red marker post also becomes visible on the right shoulder as the guardrail on that side ends.
