The first frame shows a canal dividing the scene. To the left, a grand brick building with a stone arched entrance, statues, and a prominent clock tower with crenellated tops dominates; lion statues are visible on the ground. To the right, another similar brick tower and wall rise, with a lamppost and metal scaffolding in the immediate foreground, and a wooden railing in the left foreground. A wooden bridge spans the canal in the midground, with additional buildings, trees, and a distant red and white tower in the background under a blue sky.

The view gradually pans right and pulls back, causing the foreground lamppost, metal scaffolding, and wooden railing to progressively move out of frame. This wider perspective reveals more of the brick structures on both sides: additional wall and lion statues appear to the left, and more of the brick wall extending from the right tower becomes visible. The central canal, bridge, and background remain consistently framed but are viewed from a slightly increased distance.

The first frame displays a canal leading into the distance, framed by two prominent reddish-brown brick towers with white bases and crenellated tops; a wooden bridge spans the canal between them, while a paved walkway is to the right and a dock to the left foreground, the left tower showing a blue clock and the right a white emblem.
end of description
As the viewpoint shifts rightward and slightly backward relative to the initial position, the left tower appears further to the left, and the right tower recedes rightwards. This movement progressively reveals scaffolding structures along the outer side of the right tower's wall, which becomes visible to the right of the first-frame viewpoint.
