The first frame shows a paved road curving slightly to the left, with double yellow lines and a white line, extending from the viewer into the distance. Immediately to the left, a tall, reddish-brown rock cliff rises alongside the road, dotted with sparse vegetation. To the right, a dirt shoulder gives way to green bushes, beyond which a body of water reflects the sky, bordered by distant red rock formations under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the immediate road surface to continuously pass beneath the viewer. The red cliff face on the left and the green vegetation along its base move past, revealing more of their length to the viewer's left. Simultaneously, the bushes and the body of water to the right also move past, bringing more of the distant red rock landscape into view ahead and to the right.
