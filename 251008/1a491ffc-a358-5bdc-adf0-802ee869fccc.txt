The first frame shows a cobblestone road curving to the right, with white dashed lines marking its path. To the immediate right, a dark grey barrier is visible, while a paved road with white zebra stripes enters from the left, bordered by a large green tree and a dark fence. Several multi-story buildings stand in the midground, including one with dark wood and light walls on the right, and two lighter buildings with red shutters further left, all beneath a blue sky with faint contrails and the setting sun on the far right.
end of description
As the viewpoint gradually shifts forward and slightly left, a prominent dark lamppost emerges from the right, becoming fully visible in the foreground. Simultaneously, a "HOTEL" sign and various road signs become clearer on the uphill street to the right. The initial dark grey barrier on the far right recedes from view. In the later frames, a dark car appears from the street on the far left, moving towards the viewer and turning right onto the cobblestone road.
