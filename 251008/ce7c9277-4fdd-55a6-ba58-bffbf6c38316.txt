The first frame depicts a dark asphalt road with white lines on both sides, leading away from the viewer and curving gently to the right in the distance. To the immediate left, white reflective road markers line a grassy verge, beyond which are green and autumn-colored trees and distant grey mountains under a cloudy sky. To the right, a steep, rocky hillside covered in lush green and yellow foliage rises directly adjacent to the road. end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves continuously forward along the road. The white road markers on the left recede towards the viewer, passing from the mid-ground to the foreground before exiting the frame to the bottom-left. The curve of the road ahead becomes more prominent and central, while the surrounding trees and the steep hillside on both sides appear to approach and then recede past the viewer.
