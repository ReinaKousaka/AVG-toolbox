The first frame depicts a narrow asphalt road curving slightly right, leading into a scenic mountain valley. To the left, a tall stone retaining wall topped with a wooden fence parallels the road, while on the right, a metal fence overlooks a grassy slope and a distant town with a church spire, all set against a backdrop of imposing mountains under a clear blue sky.

As the viewpoint moves forward, the stone wall on the left recedes, progressively revealing a traditional chalet-style house with a flag on the upper left. Concurrently, the road ahead continues to curve right, unveiling more of the vineyard-covered hillside and the expansive valley to the right, with a lamppost emerging further down the path. The panoramic view of the distant mountains and town remains, shifting perspective with the continuous forward motion.
