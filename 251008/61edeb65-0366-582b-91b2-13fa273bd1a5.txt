The first frame depicts a wet, rainy urban street at night, with prominent white and black zebra crossing stripes in the foreground and mid-ground. A tall building with illuminated windows stands in the background to the left, while bright headlights from several vehicles facing the viewer are visible further down the road, slightly right of center, reflecting intensely on the soaked pavement. A light-colored SUV is stationary on the left side, behind the zebra crossing and partially obscured by a traffic light displaying green.

As the frames progress, the light-colored SUV on the left begins to move, slowly driving forward from left to right across the wet zebra crossing. The bright headlights from the distant vehicles remain visible, with their reflections continuing to shimmer on the road, while the rainy night scene persists.

The foreground features a wet asphalt road with prominent white pedestrian crosswalk stripes extending across the frame, reflecting various lights. To the mid-left, a green traffic light hangs on a pole, with several streetlights and distant vehicles, some with yellow tops, visible further back. In the mid-right, a bright cluster of white headlights from oncoming traffic intensely illuminates the wet road surface. A tall, dark building with numerous glowing windows dominates the background, flanked by other buildings and more streetlights.

Across the subsequent frames, the scene remains largely static, with no significant dynamic changes or newly revealed objects occurring. The positions and appearance of the buildings, traffic light, and vehicles to the mid-left stay consistent. The bright cluster of headlights from oncoming traffic to the mid-right also maintains its intensity and general position throughout the sequence.
