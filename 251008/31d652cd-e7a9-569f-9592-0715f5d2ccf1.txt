As the person proceeds through the doorway, a brightly lit hallway is revealed. To the left of the initial viewpoint, a pantry area with open shelves and various items becomes visible, while to the right, a console table with decorative objects, a white bench, and a large painting on the wall emerge. Further ahead, a dining area with a table, chairs, and large glass doors leading outdoors is gradually unveiled.
