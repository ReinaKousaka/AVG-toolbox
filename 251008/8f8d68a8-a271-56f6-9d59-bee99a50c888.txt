The first frame depicts a vibrant city street at night, viewed from a slightly elevated perspective overlooking a wide sidewalk. On the right, three individuals walk away from the viewer along the sidewalk, with tall, illuminated buildings and storefronts lining their path. To the left of the sidewalk, a large white truck is parked parallel to the viewer, and further down the street, additional vehicles are visible. Numerous pedestrians populate the midground sidewalk, moving in various directions, while a person lies on the ground between the parked truck and the sidewalk. The background is dominated by towering skyscrapers adorned with bright billboards and signs receding into the distance under a dark sky.

The three individuals in the foreground on the right continue walking further away from the viewer. The person previously lying on the ground in the mid-left area sits up, then stands. This individual proceeds to walk towards the viewer, passing the front of the truck and eventually moving out of view to the far left of the original viewpoint. Concurrently, other pedestrians in the midground continue their movement along the sidewalk. The parked white truck and the overall background street scene remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint throughout the sequence.

As the frames progress, the pedestrians continue their movement; those on the right recede further away from the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the two individuals approaching from the mid-left draw significantly closer, with the person in the floral jacket moving to the immediate mid-left foreground. The person in the dark jacket, also approaching, reveals a white 'MoMA' shopping bag in their right hand as they near the first-frame viewpoint.
