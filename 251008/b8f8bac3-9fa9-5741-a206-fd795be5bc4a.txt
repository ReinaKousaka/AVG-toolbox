frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a distant cityscape, featuring a prominent tall tower on the right, visible across a wide river under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a dark horizontal structure occupies the lower third, with several blurry vertical bars extending upwards, partially obscuring the view. A small boat rests on the river, left of center.
end of description
As the frames progress, the foreground's horizontal structure and vertical bars rapidly shift from left to right across the initial viewpoint. This movement reveals more of the river and distant city to the left, while the cityscape and tower remain largely static on the horizon, indicating the viewer is moving from right to left.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
In the first frame, a dark gray bridge structure spans the bottom of the view, with multiple blurry vertical pillars very close to the viewer creating a grid pattern across the entire scene. Behind these, a wide river flows, flanked on the far side by a sprawling city skyline, with the prominent Tokyo Skytree visible on the right. A clear blue sky stretches above the city.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward and to the left, the blurry vertical foreground elements quickly slide across the frame from right to left. Simultaneously, a new, light gray structural barrier emerges from the bottom right, sweeping leftward to replace the initial dark bridge structure and pillars. This movement increasingly clears the view of the distant city, river, and the Tokyo Skytree.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a dark gray road surface at the bottom, topped by a light gray barrier, beyond which a distant city skyline with numerous buildings extends horizontally under a clear blue sky, prominently featuring the Tokyo Skytree on the far right.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, foreground objects rapidly appear from the right and traverse left across the frame. A white sign with a blue arrow, followed by a pole with horizontal bars, swiftly passes the viewer. Subsequently, a tall, light gray pole emerges from the right, moving left above new orange-and-white striped bollards that appear below the barrier, alongside a dark rectangular grate on the road surface.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a distant city skyline under a clear blue sky, dominated by a tall, slender tower on the far right. In the midground, various buildings and sparse greenery stretch horizontally. The foreground features a light grey concrete barrier running across the lower half, below which is a dark road surface with a thin white line.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the foreground road and barrier shift left, while the cityscape remains relatively static in the distance. A blurred light pole rapidly enters from the far left in the foreground, moving right across the barrier before exiting the frame. Subsequently, white road markings, including a broken line and an arrow, emerge on the road surface to the viewer's left, moving rightward, and a large red arrow pointing right appears on the concrete barrier to the viewer's right, also moving across the frame.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a dark road with a white line occupies the bottom, leading to a light grey concrete barrier in the midground, which displays a red arrow pointing right on its far end. Beyond the barrier, a city skyline with numerous buildings stretches across the horizon, behind which a body of water is visible, and the tall Tokyo Skytree rises prominently on the far right under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward; the red arrow on the barrier shifts left, revealing Japanese text ("進行方向") alongside it from the right, which then also traverses left. Concurrently, a slender vertical pole appears from the top right and sweeps across the frame to the left, passing in front of the relatively static distant cityscape and Skytree.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A grey concrete barrier, possibly a bridge railing, runs horizontally across the lower half of the first frame, with a dark road surface below it and a blurred grey pole near the top left. Beyond the barrier, a calm river stretches across the midground. In the background, a dense cityscape with numerous buildings is visible, topped by the prominent Tokyo Skytree towering on the far right under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, the blurry grey pole on the far left quickly moves out of frame to the left, highlighting the forward motion. The cityscape and Tokyo Skytree remain consistently visible in the background, appearing to pan slowly from right to left relative to the viewer's forward progression. In frames 5 and 6, a rapidly blurring object, likely a vehicle or sign, swiftly crosses from right to left across the foreground, just above the barrier.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A dark gray barrier occupies the immediate foreground, stretching horizontally across the bottom third of the frame. Behind this barrier, a calm body of water, likely a river, extends horizontally across the midground. Further beyond the river, a sprawling cityscape with numerous buildings and structures dominates the background, extending across the entire horizon. On the far right, a tall, slender tower (Tokyo Skytree) rises prominently above the urban landscape. A clear, vibrant blue sky fills the upper portion of the frame above the cityscape.
end of description
In frame 4, two blurred objects appear in the immediate foreground, much closer to the viewer than the initial barrier. A dark, rectangular object emerges in the mid-left, slightly above the barrier, while a circular red and white sign appears in the top-right, partially obscuring the distant cityscape and sky. By frame 5, both blurred objects continue their rapid movement out of the frame; the rectangular object shifts further left, and the circular sign moves further right. By frame 6, both transient objects have completely moved beyond the edges of the initial view, returning the scene to its prior, more stable appearance.
