In the first frame, a wet, dark cobblestone street extends forward from the viewer, flanked by buildings. To the left, a building with a white awning is adorned with string lights and foliage, featuring two display stands in front. To the right, a black and yellow striped light pole stands near a storefront with a blue "MG" illuminated sign and several containers on the ground. The distant background shows more of the street receding into darkness, lit by faint streetlights and a yellow sign.

A person holding an open umbrella emerges in the distance, walking across the street from right to left, away from the viewer. The individual moves steadily through the falling rain, becoming clearer before eventually exiting the frame to the far left in the distance. The overall scene remains consistent, with rain continuing to create reflections on the wet surfaces.

The first frame depicts a wet, dark street at night, with heavy rain visibly falling. To the viewer's immediate left stands a tall white sign with text and images, next to a lit tree and a partial view of a dark bench. On the right, a clear glass structure, likely a bus stop or kiosk, labeled "MG" at its top, is illuminated from within, with a white trash can and a planter of small plants positioned to its right. The street, marked with yellow lines, extends from the foreground into the background, leading towards a visible streetlamp, a yellow sign, and dark stone walls on both sides.

In the subsequent frames, the heavy rainfall continues consistently across the entire scene, visibly intensifying and diminishing slightly but remaining constant from the distant background towards the viewer. No new objects or scenes are revealed, and all existing elements maintain their initial spatial positions relative to the static first-frame viewpoint.
