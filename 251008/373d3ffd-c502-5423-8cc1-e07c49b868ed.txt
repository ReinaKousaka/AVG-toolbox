The viewer is on a multi-lane highway, with concrete barriers to the immediate left and right. Ahead, a dark blue pickup truck leads a white RV. To the left, a large concrete overpass diagonally spans the scene, supported by pillars, with a rocky, vegetated slope beneath it. To the right, a massive, layered reddish-brown rock cliff rises, flanked by green trees along the highway. Distant canyon walls recede into the background under a clear blue sky.

As the viewer moves forward, the blue truck and white RV recede further down the highway relative to the initial viewpoint. The concrete overpass on the left moves overhead and past, progressively revealing more of the steep, rocky, vegetated canyon wall. A light pole appears on the overpass, and a river gradually becomes visible to the right of the highway, beyond the trees, relative to the initial scene.

The first frame shows a multi-lane highway stretching ahead, with a dark blue pickup truck in the left lane and a white RV with a bike rack in the right lane, both driving in front of the viewer. To the left, a large concrete overpass spans diagonally overhead, with a steep, vegetated rock face and distant cliffs visible behind it, while to the right, a metal guardrail runs alongside dense green trees and a massive layered rock cliff.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the concrete overpass on the left gradually passes overhead and behind the viewer, revealing more of the vegetated cliffside. Concurrently, the truck and RV maintain their relative positions but move further ahead from the viewer, while the dense trees and towering rock cliff on the right also recede past the viewer's side, revealing more of the canyon road.
