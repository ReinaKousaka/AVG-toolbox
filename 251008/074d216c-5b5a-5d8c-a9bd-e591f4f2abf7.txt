The first frame displays a rainy street scene at night. In the immediate foreground to the right, a dark bush runs parallel to the viewer, while on the left, wet pavement with yellow tactile strips, a white-striped crosswalk, and a prominent utility pole are visible. A person holding a light-colored umbrella walks away from the viewer on this wet pavement, centered in the midground. To the left of the pole, a wet street reflects neon lights from distant buildings, with a white car and a bus stop sign partially visible further down the road. Storefronts with illuminated signs line both sides of the street in the background.

The person with the umbrella continues walking forward, moving further away from the viewer and gradually towards the left side of the frame along the wet pavement. As they advance, more of the storefront details to the viewer's right become revealed, and the bus stop structure to the left of the utility pole becomes increasingly prominent. The consistent heavy rain is visible throughout as light streaks.

In the first frame, a person holding a white polka-dotted umbrella is positioned in the left foreground, facing slightly right. To their right, the wet sidewalk stretches into the midground, lined by trees and a bus stop structure on the left. On the right midground, a row of brightly lit storefronts with Korean signage extends, with water cascading from their overhangs onto the steps and sidewalk below. The dark night sky is visible above, punctuated by glowing streetlights and falling rain.

Chronologically, the person and their umbrella in the left foreground gradually move out of the frame towards the left. By the third frame, only a small portion of the umbrella remains visible, and from the fourth frame onward, they are entirely gone, leaving the left foreground empty. Throughout the sequence, water continues to visibly stream down from the foreground bush on the right and across the entire wet sidewalk, indicating ongoing heavy rain.

The first frame depicts a rainy night scene on a city street. To the viewer's immediate right, a raised concrete sidewalk with several wet, muddy steps leads up to illuminated storefronts displaying Korean text and outdoor AC units. To the left, a wet, brick-patterned sidewalk runs into the distance, bordered by trees and featuring a bus stop sign in the foreground. A wet street, reflecting lights, parallels the left sidewalk, with white cars visible further down the road. A bright light in the center background creates a significant glare.

As the frames progress, a consistent heavy rain is evident, causing water to accumulate and flow visibly down the concrete steps and along the gutter to the right of the viewer's position. Reflections on the extremely wet ground and street intensify slightly with the ongoing rainfall. Additionally, a white car positioned on the street in the mid-ground subtly shifts, appearing to move slightly from left to right relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
