The first frame presents a panoramic view of a charming town, Hallstatt, situated along a dark green lake that fills the bottom right, reflecting the scene. Numerous colorful houses, interspersed with two prominent church steeples in the mid-ground, cluster along the waterfront against a backdrop of steep, lush green mountains, with a white boat visible at a dock on the far left foreground.

The subsequent frames show a slow, subtle zoom-out and slight upward shift of the viewpoint, gradually revealing more of the towering, grey rock face of the mountain on the far left and an emerging waterfall descending its side, previously mostly obscured by the top-left edge of the initial view.
