In the first frame, a smiling woman is partially visible on the far left in the foreground, next to a man with glasses wearing a dark jacket, and another person in a blue coat behind him, all walking towards the background. Overhead, an archway structure with blue fairy lights stretches across the frame, featuring dangling lights, while to the right, a grassy area, a bare tree, and a purple-blue rectangular object are visible. A paved path leads into the midground, flanked by two red-topped bollards, with several pedestrians walking towards illuminated buildings in the distant background that display festive decorations.
end of description
The camera steadily moves forward along the paved path. The initial foreground figures, including the woman and man, progressively exit the frame to the left, revealing more of the path and additional pedestrians moving towards the background. The red-topped bollards, initially in the midground, shift closer to the viewer's new foreground position. The distant buildings and trees remain largely in their background positions but appear slightly larger as the viewpoint advances.
