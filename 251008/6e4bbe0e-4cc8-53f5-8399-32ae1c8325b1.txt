In the first frame, a wet, snowy urban sidewalk extends into the distance, with a person in a red jacket walking away from the viewer in the mid-ground. To the immediate right, a snow-covered evergreen tree in a white pot features a yellow spherical ornament, with dark building windows and a red fire hydrant further along the sidewalk. On the left, a snow-covered street with traffic and distant buildings is visible, lined by planters and bare trees.
end of description
The camera advances along the sidewalk, causing the snow-covered tree and yellow ornament to move out of view to the far right. Simultaneously, a golden awning with the number '368' attached to the building on the right becomes fully revealed overhead, extending from the structure previously partially seen. The person in the red jacket continues walking further ahead into the distance from the viewer's original position, while the building's facade on the right is increasingly exposed, showing reflections and details like 'CONTACT' on a window. The snowy street, cars, and distant buildings on the left also progressively approach the advancing viewer's updated position.

The first frame presents a nighttime city street during a snowfall, with a wet sidewalk on the right leading past a building featuring dark windows and an illuminated gold awning displaying "368" above a security camera. To the left, a snow-covered street is visible with cars, bare trees, and frosted planters, while a person in a red jacket walks away from the viewer on the central sidewalk, under the glow of distant building lights.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the building facade on the right gradually becomes more prominent, revealing "368 ninth" on a window, a QR code, and an "FOC" sign towards the bottom right, while the initial "368" awning and security camera move upwards out of view. Concurrently, the bare tree and snow-covered planters on the left appear closer as the person in red continues walking further away into the persistent snowfall.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a snowy, wet city street scene at night, viewed from a sidewalk partially covered by a building's overhang on the right. To the immediate right, a dark building facade with reflective windows recedes into the background, topped by a light-colored soffit and a security camera near the upper right. In the left foreground, two snow-dusted planters with bare branches are visible on the wet sidewalk. Further ahead on the left, the snow-covered street features cars with illuminated headlights moving away from the viewer, passing a bare tree and a "West 19th St" sign. In the midground, a person wearing a red jacket walks away from the viewer along the sidewalk, heading toward the illuminated city background with tall buildings and decorative lights.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the person in the red jacket continuously walks further away from the viewer along the sidewalk, receding into the background. Falling snowflakes drift visibly across the entire scene, particularly in the foreground and midground, gradually accumulating on the street and plants to the left. Vehicles on the snow-covered street also progress further away from the viewer, their headlights still piercing the snowy atmosphere in the midground. The wet surfaces of the sidewalk and building reflections subtly shift with the ongoing snowfall and movement.

The first frame displays a snowy city street and sidewalk at night, with snow actively falling. In the foreground, a large potted plant dusted with snow sits to the left, while on the right, a brick wall and a building entrance with dark windows are visible under a golden awning. A person in a red jacket walks away from the viewer down the wet sidewalk, with the snow-covered street and distant illuminated city buildings to the viewer's left.
end of description
As frames progress, the person in the red jacket continues walking further down the sidewalk away from the viewer. On the street to the left, vehicles move past and a bicycle delivery person with an orange bag emerges, traversing the street. Simultaneously, a grey panel on the brick wall to the right of the viewer retracts, revealing a "nueces" sign.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a snowy city street at night, with a wet sidewalk stretching into the midground, featuring a snow-dusted potted plant to the viewer's left and a building fa√ßade on the right. In the midground, a person in a red jacket walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk towards "West 31st St," while vehicles move on the snow-covered street further back, flanked by distant illuminated city buildings.
end of description
As the frames progress, the person in the red jacket continues to walk further away from the viewer along the sidewalk. Simultaneously, a black SUV and a vehicle with an orange box proceed slowly from left to right across the snow-covered street. Throughout the sequence, heavy snow consistently falls across the entire scene, visible against the illuminated urban background.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a snowy city street scene at night. In the foreground left, a bare tree with snow at its base stands next to a low, zig-zag patterned fence. To the mid-left, a purple trash can sits near a snowy street, where a yellow traffic light is visible further down. A wet sidewalk extends diagonally towards the center background, leading to a "West 37th St" sign and a person in a red coat walking away from the viewer. On the mid-right, a building facade with large dark windows and a golden pole is present, with city buildings visible in the snowy background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the person in the red coat on the sidewalk continues to walk further away from the first-frame viewpoint. A person on a bicycle, wearing an orange jacket, emerges onto the snowy street to the left, moving in the same direction as the person in red. The camera subtly pans right and zooms in slightly, revealing additional details like "36X" building numbers and a "FIRE DEPT" sign on the lower right facade, which were previously partially obscured from the initial viewpoint. The snowfall remains consistent throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a snowy city street at night. In the immediate foreground, a purple planter covered in snow and a tree trunk are visible to the viewer's left, while a patterned metal grate sits at the bottom edge. A wet sidewalk extends into the mid-ground, flanked on the left by a snowy curb, a fire hydrant, and a trash can. To the viewer's right, a dark building with large glass windows and an illuminated purple doorway (marked '368') stands. In the mid-ground, a snow-dusted street hosts a cyclist on the far left and pedestrians further down, including one in a red jacket walking away, beneath streetlights and a 'West 31st St' sign. Tall, illuminated buildings dominate the background under a dark, snowing sky.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, snowflakes continue falling actively across the scene. The person in the red jacket and the cyclist on the street both move further away from the viewer's initial position. Concurrently, the building facade on the viewer's right reveals slightly more of its edge and the purple light within its doorway intensifies, indicating a subtle forward or rightward shift in the camera's original viewpoint.
