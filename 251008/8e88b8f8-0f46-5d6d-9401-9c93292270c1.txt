The first frame shows a paved path curving slightly rightwards into the distance, with the viewer positioned on it. To the immediate left is a steep, brush-covered hillside featuring a concrete retaining wall along the path and, higher up, a small stone building. To the right, a wooden fence parallels the path, bordering a steep drop-off that reveals a wide valley under a bright blue sky with faint distant mountains. Overlays include a green vertical progress bar on the far left and various metrics like pace, speed, and time on the far right.

The viewer moves forward along the paved path, causing the vegetated hillside, retaining wall, and building on the left to gradually pass by and recede. Simultaneously, the wooden fence on the right edge of the path also moves past, revealing more of the steep drop-off and the expansive valley beyond the first-frame viewpoint. As the path continues, the tunnel entrance within the left retaining wall becomes more fully visible.

The first frame shows a paved road curving to the right, bordered on the left by a vine-covered concrete wall leading to a tunnel entrance and an uphill grassy slope with a rustic house. On the right, a wooden fence lines a steep embankment dropping off to a distant valley with mountains and bare trees under a bright sky. Overlays display running data on the left and bottom right. end of description. The subsequent frames reveal the viewer moving forward along the road, causing the retaining wall, house, tunnel entrance, and wooden fence to move progressively closer and past the initial viewpoint, while the running metrics on the bottom right continuously update.
