In the first frame, train tracks extend from the bottom center into the distance, curving slightly to the right, flanked by a white gravel path on the left and a grassy embankment on the right. A heavily forested hillside rises on the far left with distant buildings, while more trees and hills are visible on the right and in the background, all beneath a clear blue sky with overhead wires and poles. A white vertical object is partially seen on the far upper left.
end of description
As the train moves forward, the tracks, gravel path, and the immediate grassy embankment continuously shift from the foreground towards the sides and behind the viewer's initial position. The curve to the right gradually intensifies, bringing a small white structure on the upper right embankment into clearer view as it passes. The forested hillsides on both sides dynamically change perspective, and the overhead wires and poles sequentially move from the central view towards the left, eventually exiting the frame.
