First, the first frame presents an aerial view of a lush garden featuring a central green lawn, a stepping stone path on the left, and dense green trees across the top and left edges. On the right, a tall evergreen tree overlooks planted beds, while a white cube-like structure and a spherical bush are partially visible in the bottom right foreground.

The subsequent frames show the camera slowly zooming out and shifting slightly right, revealing more of the overall scene. This movement makes the white cube-like structure and spherical bush appear smaller and further away at the bottom right, while progressively revealing more of a building structure located behind the tall evergreen tree to the right of the garden's initial expanse.
