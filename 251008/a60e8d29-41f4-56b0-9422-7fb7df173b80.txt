The first frame captures a sunlit city street receding into the distance, flanked by buildings and trees. A dark car is in the immediate right foreground, with a white van parked further ahead on the right curb. On the left, a red car is parked, and several vehicles, led by a dark SUV, drive away in the central lanes towards a distant city skyline with prominent skyscrapers and a construction crane.

As the viewer moves forward, the dark car to the immediate right and the red car on the left move out of view to the sides of the original viewpoint. The white van on the right and other street-side objects gradually pass by as more parked cars appear on both curbs, while the vehicles ahead recede further, and the distant city skyline appears closer.

In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a city street, looking straight ahead. A multi-story brick building lines the left side, behind a row of parked cars and trees. On the right, a white pickup truck occupies the immediate foreground, followed by more parked vehicles, trees, and another building. The street extends into the distance, where two cars are driving, and a city skyline with several tall buildings, including one with a construction crane, is visible under a blue sky with scattered clouds.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the street. The white pickup truck on the immediate right and the black SUV on the immediate left move out of view, becoming behind the viewer. New parked cars are continually revealed on both sides of the road, appearing closer as the viewer advances. A speed limit sign (30 MPH) on a pole becomes visible on the right sidewalk, approaching the viewer, while a 'd+mus' banner appears on the left building.

In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a paved road with white lane markings extending into the distance under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left is the rear of a white SUV, followed by a black SUV, a silver sedan, and another white SUV parked along the curb beside a sidewalk lined with green trees. A multi-story brick building with a vertical "d mus" banner occupies the upper left, while several cars are seen moving away from the viewer in the road's center. To the immediate right, the front portion of a white van is visible, followed by a line of parked white vans and pickup trucks, and a row of green trees, with a "SPEED LIMIT 30" sign attached to a pole in the upper right. Distant buildings are visible on the horizon.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the white SUV on the viewer's immediate left and the white van on the immediate right progressively exit the frame. New parked vehicles, including a black SUV and silver sedan on the left, and a series of white pickup trucks and vans on the right, enter the scene and move backward relative to the viewer. Further along the right side, a tall, dark construction barrier or hoarding structure becomes visible and extends along the curb, eventually revealing construction materials behind it. The distant buildings and vehicles ahead of the viewer gradually approach, with a traffic light becoming clearer at an intersection in the background.
