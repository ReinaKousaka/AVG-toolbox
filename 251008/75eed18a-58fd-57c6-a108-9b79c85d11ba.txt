The first frame captures a train track receding into the distance, curving right, flanked by gravel embankments and green fields under a bright blue sky with a sun flare in the upper-center. Bare trees line the left embankment, while utility poles with overhead wires run alongside the track and across the upper frame, leading towards snow-capped mountains in the background.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the train tracks, causing the utility pole and bare trees initially on the left to shift towards the bottom-left as they are passed. The tracks and surrounding landscape continuously advance from the distance towards and then beyond the viewer, revealing new sections of the valley and mountains ahead. The consistent perspective suggests continuous motion along the railway line.
