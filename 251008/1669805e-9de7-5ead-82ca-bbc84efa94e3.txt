The first frame presents a street view looking forward under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a white van is partially visible on the far left, and a large white box truck occupies the far right, parked at the curb. The paved road features double yellow lines in the center. Along the left side, a row of parked cars, buildings, and lush green trees line the street, with a streetlamp prominent. The right side features a building facade and more trees behind the white truck. In the distant background, a prominent building with a dome-like structure and a palm tree marks the end of the visible street.

As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the white van on the far left and the large white truck on the far right progressively exit the frame to their respective sides. The white truck's yellow cab and a new black passenger van, previously obscured, become fully visible parked along the right curb in the middle ground. The parked cars on the left and the buildings and trees on both sides advance closer to the viewer, moving laterally out of view. The distant street scene, including the dome building and palm tree, continuously approaches the viewer while remaining centered.

The first frame displays a sunlit city street with the viewer looking forward, revealing a double yellow line down the center of the road. Parked vehicles line both sides, with a light grey car closest on the left and a black van partially visible on the right; buildings and lush, rounded trees flank the street, leading the eye towards a distant white building topped with a dome. Two white cars are visible further down the street, moving away from the viewer.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the street, the black van on the right reveals a person exiting its rear door, who then walks further to the right out of view. Simultaneously, a grey SUV moves from the viewer's right into the left lane, driving towards the viewer. The parked cars on the left become more pronounced, and additional street details emerge closer to the viewer's position.

The first frame shows a sunny city street looking forward, flanked by multi-story buildings and trees. In the immediate foreground, a dark car and a silver SUV are parked on the left, while a black van with a person stepping out is partially visible on the right. A white car is visible further down the road in the center, leading to a distant building topped with a golden dome.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the foreground vehicles quickly disappear from view, now behind the viewer's initial position. A new white sedan becomes visible, parked further down the street on the left, as the previously distant buildings and trees progressively move closer to the viewer. The road ahead remains clear, with the white car and domed building becoming more prominent as the scene advances.
