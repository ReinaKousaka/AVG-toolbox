The first frame depicts a park scene under heavy rain. In the foreground, a large expanse of green grass is extensively waterlogged with numerous puddles. In the midground, several trees with green foliage are visible, including one prominently bent tree towards the center-left and a smaller one to its right. A traditional gazebo with a blue tiled roof and a wooden base stands slightly right of center in the midground, partially obscured by the falling rain. A dense line of dark green trees forms the background, extending across the width of the frame, beneath an overcast grey sky, with a street lamp partially visible on the far right.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the heavy rain continues to fall consistently across the scene. The visible streaks of rain appear to become slightly more defined against the dark background trees and overall clearer as the sequence progresses. The water accumulation on the grassy field in the foreground persists, with minor shifts in the shapes and reflections within the numerous puddles on the ground.

The first frame displays a park landscape under heavy rain with an overcast sky. In the foreground, patches of green grass are interspersed with extensive areas of standing water. Centrally located in the midground is a traditional Korean-style gazebo featuring a blue tiled roof and brown wooden railings, also surrounded by water. To the left, several trees with green foliage are visible, and to the right stands a street lamp, all against a dense backdrop of trees in the background.

Throughout the following frames, heavy rain visibly continues to fall across the entire scene, maintaining the extensive puddles in the foreground and around the gazebo. The water levels appear consistent, indicating ongoing precipitation without any newly revealed objects or scenes.

In the first frame, a park landscape is seen under heavy rain. A central, traditional gazebo with a blue tiered roof and reddish-brown base is surrounded by standing muddy water. To the gazebo's left, a small tree with green leaves leans, while to its right, another smaller tree stands before a multi-headed streetlamp. The foreground is largely submerged in water with patches of grass, and the background features a dense line of dark green trees under a grey, overcast sky.
end of description.
Across the subsequent frames, heavy rainfall persists throughout the entire scene, visibly intensifying the downpour and causing continuous splashes and ripples on the expansive muddy water in the foreground and around the gazebo. No new objects or changes in the spatial arrangement of park elements occur; the primary dynamic is the ongoing and unabated heavy rain.
