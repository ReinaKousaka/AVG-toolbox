The first frame captures a narrow street flanked by buildings with shops; in the foreground are an A-frame sign and small plant on the left, and a large potted plant and clothes rack on the right, with several pedestrians walking into the distance.
end of description
Over subsequent frames, pedestrians continue moving down the street: the woman in the floral dress on the left and the woman in the grey dress on the right proceed further away from the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, a woman in a green dress and a man emerge from the right mid-ground, walking towards the viewer, gradually becoming more central and closer to the original viewpoint. The A-frame sign in the left foreground slightly shifts out of frame to the left, indicating a minimal camera adjustment.

The viewer stands in a narrow, bustling street lined with multi-story buildings on both sides. In the immediate foreground to the right, a large potted plant with green foliage and red blooms partially obscures a woman in a green dress and a man in a blue polo shirt, who are walking towards the viewer on the right side of the street. Further down the street on the left, several pedestrians walk away from the viewer, including a woman in a patterned dress carrying a yellow bag, while shops with awnings and windows line the path towards the bright sky in the background.
end of description
The woman in the green dress and the man in the blue shirt continue walking towards and past the viewer, moving from the mid-right across the foreground to the far right, with the man eventually holding a white shopping bag. As they move to the right and out of view, a clothes rack displaying white garments is newly revealed on the right sidewalk, positioned behind their initial location relative to the viewer. Other pedestrians in the midground consistently move further down the street, receding into the distance.

In the first frame, the right foreground shows the head and shoulder of a man in a blue shirt. To his left, in the mid-ground, a woman stands by a black table with shoes and a clothing rack holding light-colored garments, in front of shops lining the right side of the street. Further back on the right, potted plants sit below shops, including one with a blue awning marked "CLAUDIE PIERLOT." On the left side of the street, three women walk towards the viewer; the nearest wears a floral dress, followed by a woman in black, and another in a pink hoodie carrying a white shopping bag. Behind them, the left side of the street features shops with closed awnings, including one with a "ZARA" sign, and extends into the background with more buildings under a bright sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the man in the right foreground slowly moves out of view to the right. Concurrently, the three women on the left side of the street walk closer to the viewer. The woman in the floral dress subsequently moves past the viewer's left side and out of the frame, while the remaining two women continue their approach towards the viewer. The woman standing by the clothing rack on the right remains in her position throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a narrow shopping street flanked by multi-story buildings. In the immediate foreground to the left, two young women walk towards the viewer's left, one carrying a red bag and a phone, the other a "MANGO" shopping bag and a phone. To the foreground right, a clothing rack with garments stands beside a black table displaying shoes and other items, with large potted plants lining the sidewalk. Further down the street, buildings with shop signs like "ZARA" on the left and "CLAUDIE PIERLOT" on the right are visible, with several people walking away from the viewer in the mid-distance.
end of description
The two young women in the left foreground walk progressively past the viewer, exiting the frame to the viewer's far left. Simultaneously, other pedestrians in the mid-distance continue moving further away down the street. The clothing rack, table, and potted plants on the right foreground remain stationary relative to the viewer, maintaining their initial spatial positions as the scene gradually moves forward.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a pedestrian street looking forward, with buildings lining both sides. To the viewer's immediate right, a clothing rack with white garments and a large potted plant are visible, while on the left, a person in a floral dress walks away from the viewer, with other pedestrians further ahead in the midground.
end of description
As the video progresses, the camera slowly moves forward along the street. The clothing rack and the closer potted plant on the right shift out of the frame to the right, and all visible pedestrians continue to recede further into the distance ahead of the viewer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a narrow pedestrian street lined by multi-story buildings, with a ZARA store on the left and various shops with awnings on the right, where a large potted plant stands in the foreground; numerous pedestrians are visible along the street, mostly moving away from the viewer.
end of description
In subsequent frames, all visible pedestrians continuously advance further down the street away from the first-frame viewpoint, while the buildings and the foreground potted plant remain static relative to the viewer's initial position.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a narrow, sunlit street stretches into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings. On the left, shop windows, including one labeled "ZARA," line the facade, while on the right, storefronts with awnings, like "marc le bihan opticien," are visible, alongside a large potted bush in the mid-right foreground. Numerous pedestrians populate the paved street, walking in various directions relative to the viewer.
end of description
As the frames progress, the pedestrians on the street exhibit dynamic movement; individuals initially closer to the viewer on the left side walk forward, exiting the frame to the viewer's left. Simultaneously, other people in the mid-ground move both towards and away from the viewer, constantly altering the composition of the crowd. The architectural elements of the street remain stationary, with no new scenes or objects revealed beyond the changing flow of people.
