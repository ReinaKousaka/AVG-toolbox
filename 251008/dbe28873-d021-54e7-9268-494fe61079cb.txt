In the first frame, a street scene is captured, densely populated with people walking in various directions. In the foreground, slightly to the left, a man in a blue jacket looks down at his phone while carrying a large, angular white object, possibly part of a costume, with a black stroller positioned near his feet. Behind him, a person in a dark hooded costume is partially visible. The midground is filled with a bustling crowd, including a man in a tan jacket and white turtleneck centrally located, also looking at his phone, and a young girl in a plaid skirt with a small white pumpkin bag walking towards the viewer from the right-center. Buildings with illuminated windows line the left side of the street, while more buildings and trees frame the right, with the street extending into the hazy distance, revealing more people.

As the frames progress, the man in the blue jacket and the large white object moves closer to the viewer and further left, revealing more of the black hooded figure behind him who eventually holds a red glowing item. The central man in the tan jacket steadily moves forward, lifting his gaze from his phone and turning his head to his right. The girl in the plaid skirt continues her approach, drawing closer to the viewer, while a woman in a tan coat pushing a stroller moves into the midground from the right, also approaching the viewer. The dense crowd continuously shifts and flows throughout the street, with individuals moving both towards and further into the background.
