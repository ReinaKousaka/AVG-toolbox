The first frame displays a serene landscape featuring a wide, light-turquoise lake in the mid-ground, framed by verdant mountains receding into the background under a partly cloudy sky. In the foreground, a lush green grassy slope leads to a paved road, where a light-colored car is visible on the far left, while a cluster of trees and a small house stand along the lakeshore on the right.

Subsequently, the car on the road moves rightward, briefly disappearing behind the central trees before reappearing and continuing its path towards the right edge of the frame. Concurrently, a boat's wake traverses the lake from the left towards the right, and a new building with a red roof emerges into view from the right side, positioned closer to the viewer than the initial small house.
