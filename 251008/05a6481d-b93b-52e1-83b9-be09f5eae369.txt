In the first frame, a woman in a brown jacket and pink pants, holding a coffee cup, walks left-center on a crosswalk, while a man in a dark coat carrying a light-colored bag walks right-center, both advancing towards the viewer. Behind them on the left, a white graffiti-covered van is parked, and a large building with "Rainbow" and "PRET A MANGER" signs spans the midground. The far background on the right reveals a bustling city street lined with tall buildings and numerous pedestrians.

The two main pedestrians continue walking past the viewer's original position, moving towards the left and out of the frame. Simultaneously, other pedestrians on the distant sidewalk and crosswalk advance, with new individuals appearing from the left and right in the midground and background. Notably, a new person with a black rolling suitcase enters from the far left foreground in later frames, crossing the street towards the right.

In the first frame, a busy city street is shown with a white-striped crosswalk spanning the foreground. On the far left, a woman wearing a dark coat pulls a black wheeled suitcase, while a man in a brown puffer jacket and a woman in a white bucket hat walk across the center towards the viewer's right. Behind them on the left is a white van parked near a red building with "Rainbow" and "Manger" signs, and a busy sidewalk lined with pedestrians extends into the distance on the right, bordered by a light blue barrier. Distant tall buildings with digital billboards are visible down the street under a clear sky.

As frames progress, the woman with the suitcase and the central couple continue walking right across the crosswalk, gradually moving further away and towards the right edge of the frame. Subsequently, more pedestrians, including a man in a dark coat and glasses, appear from the far left, walking across the crosswalk towards the right. Simultaneously, other pedestrians initially visible on the far right sidewalk in the first frame move closer to the viewer.

The first frame depicts a bustling city street with a wide crosswalk where several pedestrians are moving, including a woman in a white hat with a camera in the left foreground and another woman in a grey jacket walking towards the viewer in the right midground. In the background, a red building featuring "Rainbow" and "PRET A MANGER" signs dominates the left, while a busy street with distant skyscrapers and advertising billboards stretches to the right.
end of description
Over subsequent frames, the woman in the grey jacket progressively walks closer to the viewer across the crosswalk, while other pedestrians, including one with a rolling suitcase, continue crossing from left to right. A white van also becomes fully visible on the far left, slowly moving behind the foreground crossers as the scene progresses.
