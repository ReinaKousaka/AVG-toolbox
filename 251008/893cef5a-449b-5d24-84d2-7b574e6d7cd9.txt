In the following frames, the two individuals walking in the far-left foreground continue moving left, gradually exiting the frame. The woman in the white dress and hat, positioned centrally in the foreground, subtly adjusts her arm position.

An EU flag becomes visible at the top-left of the leftmost building, which was previously unadorned.
