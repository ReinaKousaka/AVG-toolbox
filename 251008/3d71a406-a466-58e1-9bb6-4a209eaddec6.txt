A traditional stone wall with a tiled roof runs along the left, against which a woman in black and a man in a dark jacket stand in the foreground. In the mid-ground, a young person in a dark jacket and a woman in a white shirt stand on the sidewalk, both facing the wall. To the right, a street with a red bike lane and gray road is lined by ginkgo trees with yellow leaves, beyond which modern buildings rise. A woman in a light coat stands near the street on the right, holding a phone.
end of description
The young person in the dark jacket (mid-ground) turns towards the viewer, smiling, and raises their phone as if taking a photo. The woman initially behind them on the sidewalk starts to walk away from the wall, moving further along the left sidewalk towards the background. Concurrently, the woman against the far left wall shifts her posture and looks towards the viewer. A silver car is newly revealed on the street, moving from the background towards the right.

The first frame displays a street scene with a traditional stone wall along the left, where a man in a gray hoodie in the foreground and a woman in the midground are taking pictures of the wall. Behind the foreground man is another person, while a second woman also photographs the street from the midground-right, with autumn trees, a road, and buildings visible beyond her.
end of description
Subsequently, the man in the gray hoodie and the person behind him gradually move out of frame to the right and left, respectively, revealing more of the paved sidewalk and the continuous stone wall on the left. Concurrently, the woman taking pictures of the wall repositions herself, turning and lifting her phone higher, eventually moving left to reveal more of the path ahead, while a car passes on the street to the right.

The viewer looks forward along a paved sidewalk bordered by a long, light-colored stone wall with a traditional tiled roofline on the left and a row of trees with yellow leaves and a street on the right. A prominent street lamp with banners and a hanging flower basket stands in the mid-right foreground, with several pedestrians walking further ahead along the left wall and a woman partially visible in the extreme foreground right, holding a white bag.
end of description
As the viewer progresses forward, the woman in the extreme right foreground quickly exits the frame behind the initial viewpoint. The stone wall and trees on both sides recede towards the background, while new segments of the sidewalk, wall, trees, and the street with moving vehicles continuously reveal themselves further ahead of the first-frame viewpoint. Pedestrians on the sidewalk also shift their positions, moving relative to the viewer's forward motion.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a paved sidewalk extending forward, bordered on the left by a stone wall topped with a traditional tiled roof and on the right by a street. Separating the sidewalk and street are a row of trees with yellow-green leaves and a street lamp adorned with a hanging basket of pink and green flowers. A group of pedestrians is visible walking away from the viewer on the mid-ground sidewalk, while a dark van drives away on the multi-lane road to the right.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the camera's viewpoint remains static as the group of pedestrians on the sidewalk and the dark van on the road continue to move away from the viewer, receding further into the distance. A single pedestrian in a light-colored jacket is also seen walking along the sidewalk, moving away from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a paved sidewalk extending into the mid-ground on the left, flanked by a stone wall adorned with traditional Korean roof tiles. To the right, a row of ginkgo trees with yellowing leaves separates the sidewalk from a multi-lane road, while several pedestrians walk away from the viewer along the sidewalk. Modern buildings with glass facades are visible further down the road on the far right.
end of description
Subsequently, the pedestrians continue walking further away from the viewer along the sidewalk, moving deeper into the scene. The woman in the light-colored top, initially closest to the viewer on the sidewalk, gradually recedes into the distance alongside the wall. No new objects or scenes are revealed; only the existing people move within the established environment.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a vibrant street scene with a textured stone wall, topped with traditional Korean roof tiles, running along the left side of a paved sidewalk that extends into the distance. On this sidewalk, a woman in a light-colored top is visible in the mid-foreground, talking on her phone, while a group of pedestrians is further along the sidewalk behind her. To the right, a large tree trunk dominates the immediate foreground, beside a street with a distinct red bike lane, which is flanked by more trees with bright yellow-green leaves and contemporary buildings in the background.

end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective subtly moves forward, causing the objects on the sidewalk to appear closer. The woman on the left, still on her phone, walks towards the viewer, becoming larger and moving further left in the frame. The group of people behind her also advances, with a man in a light grey sweater and white pants becoming more prominent within the approaching crowd. Simultaneously, a woman in a short white dress and black boots, positioned on the right edge of the sidewalk near the large tree, shifts her weight and adjusts her stance, observing the surroundings.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a partial view of a woman with a brown shoulder bag and phone is visible in the immediate foreground, positioned left of center. To her right, a traditional stone wall with a tiled roof border recedes into the distance along a sidewalk occupied by several pedestrians. A man in a grey hoodie and a woman in a white jacket walk towards the viewer in the central midground, with another woman in a dark outfit standing further along the sidewalk to the right of them. A tree with yellow-green leaves stands on the right edge of the sidewalk, separating it from a multi-lane road featuring a red bicycle lane. Farther down the street, more trees, buildings, and a green street sign are visible.
end of description
The woman in the immediate foreground moves out of frame to the viewer's left. The man in the grey hoodie and the woman in the white jacket steadily walk towards the viewer, passing the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the woman standing on the right side of the sidewalk turns her head and lifts her hands towards her head, slightly adjusting her pose. As the main walking pair continues to move left past the viewer, additional pedestrians become more clearly visible on the sidewalk behind them.
