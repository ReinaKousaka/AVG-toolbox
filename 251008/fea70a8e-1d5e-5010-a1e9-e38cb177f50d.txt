In the foreground, a dark, wet ground surface lies below a low, green hedge running horizontally across the lower middle of the frame, with smaller plants to its left. Behind the hedge, a wet asphalt parking lot occupies the left midground, holding several white cars and a yellow cone, while a modern building with a rounded, colorful facade stands in the right midground, partially obscured by a large tree and a small wooden structure. A wet paved road recedes into the center-right background, beyond which tall apartment buildings are faintly visible through a misty, overcast sky on the left. Raindrops are actively falling across the entire scene, towards the viewer.

Throughout the subsequent frames, heavy rain continues to consistently fall from above. A small, dark vehicle on the road in the mid-background steadily moves further away from the viewer. Simultaneously, the camera subtly pans to the left, gradually revealing more of the parking lot and distant structures on that side. By the final frames, a distinctive metal tower, resembling the Eiffel Tower, becomes clearly visible on the far left, behind the parking lot and further away from the viewer. The overall misty and rainy atmospheric conditions remain constant.
