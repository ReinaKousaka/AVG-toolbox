The first frame shows a city street from a slightly elevated viewpoint. A silver car is parked on the left sidewalk near a person in dark clothing standing with their back to the viewer. A paved sidewalk extends from the foreground, lined by several trees and a pole with a 'no pedestrian/bicycle' sign. A multi-lane road occupies the midground and background, with a black sedan moving away on the right lane and other vehicles visible further down. Modern buildings with reflective facades line both sides of the street under an overcast sky.

In the following frames, the black sedan on the right side of the road moves further away from the viewer. The person on the sidewalk to the left unfolds and holds a large white object, appearing to examine it. Subsequently, a silver SUV enters the frame from the right side of the road, moving towards the viewer, and continues to approach in the right-center lane.

The first frame depicts a wide city street with multiple lanes extending into the background, flanked by buildings and trees. To the viewer's immediate right stands a large tree trunk, partially obscuring a pole with a blue circular sign indicating pedestrian and bicycle paths. On the paved sidewalk to the left, a person in dark clothing is visible, standing near a light-colored car partially visible at the bottom-left. In the midground, a silver SUV and a dark sedan are moving rightward on the road, while other vehicles are parked along the sidewalk on the left, in front of modern buildings with extensive glass facades. The street recedes into the distance, showing more traffic and towering structures under a bright sky.
end of description
From the second frame, the silver SUV and dark sedan on the road to the viewer's right begin to move past the immediate foreground and exit the frame. Simultaneously, the person on the sidewalk to the viewer's left starts to turn and walk further leftward, eventually exiting the frame. Throughout the sequence, new vehicles emerge from the distant background on the road, traveling towards or across the viewer's perspective, notably a dark car appearing on the right side.

In the foreground to the left, a silver car is partially visible with a person in a dark shirt standing beside it, facing away from the viewer. To the right, a paved sidewalk extends into the background, flanked by a prominent tree and a multi-lane road beyond it. On the left midground, a modern building with large windows (displaying a Volkswagen logo) is visible, with a red car parked on a raised area in front. The road on the right midground contains several cars, including a black car moving towards the viewer, and is bordered by more trees and bollards further down the sidewalk. The background reveals a dense cityscape with tall buildings and a cloudy sky.
end of description
The person on the left turns their head towards the viewer, then fully pivots their body to face the viewer from their initial position. Simultaneously, the black car on the road continues to move from the mid-right past the viewer towards the mid-left. A white car then enters the frame from the far background on the right, proceeding forward on the same road.

The first frame shows a bustling city street from a low-angle viewpoint on a sidewalk. In the immediate foreground, a silver car's hood is visible at the bottom left, next to which a person in a dark shirt stands, initially facing away from the viewer. To the right, a tiled sidewalk with a yellow curb line extends into the midground, featuring a dark tree trunk and a parked scooter. Along the left midground, a modern building with a large glass facade displays a circular Volkswagen logo, with a red car parked on an elevated ramp leading to its entrance. The right midground and background reveal a multi-lane road with a white taxi approaching from the distant right, surrounded by other vehicles, traffic lights, and numerous tall buildings lining the street.
end of description
The person standing next to the silver car on the left gradually turns their head towards the viewer, revealing a smile as they continue to face more directly forward. Simultaneously, the white taxi on the road in the mid-right proceeds forward, moving from right to left across the frame and eventually exiting to the left. Distant vehicles on the road also show subtle movement throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a paved sidewalk in the foreground, with a modern glass-fronted building on the viewer's left displaying a red car on a raised platform, indicative of a car dealership. A prominent tree stands to the right of the viewer's path, near a parked scooter, with more trees lining the sidewalk further ahead. To the right, a multi-lane road with cars in the distance extends towards an intersection with traffic lights and numerous tall buildings in the background.

end of description

A person on the scooter, initially positioned near the prominent tree to the right, begins to move forward along the sidewalk, away from the viewer. The scooter continues to travel down the sidewalk, passing the bollards on the left. The person and scooter gradually recede into the distance, disappearing towards the background as traffic on the main road also shows slight movement.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a street scene with a light-and-dark-tiled sidewalk in the foreground, featuring a circular manhole cover on the lower-left and a tree trunk partially obscuring the lower-right, with a second manhole cover at its base. A red scooter is parked on the sidewalk in the mid-right, behind the tree. To the left, a Volkswagen dealership building with a large logo displays a red car on a raised platform with concrete steps. Parallel to the sidewalk, a multi-lane city road stretches into the distance, populated by various vehicles in the midground and background, flanked by tall city buildings under a bright sky.
end of description
The viewpoint remains stationary across all frames. Traffic on the multi-lane road, situated to the right and center of the first-frame viewpoint, demonstrates continuous forward movement. A dark car in the mid-ground proceeds further down the street, while an orange bus slowly enters the scene from the far right, moving away from the viewer. Several other cars, mainly white, are also seen advancing in the same direction along the road.
