The first frame displays a wide, snow-covered landscape extending from the immediate foreground to the distant, snow-capped mountains spanning the horizon. Scattered brown and green trees are visible on the midground mountain slopes, while several dark poles rise vertically from the snow in the mid-right. A bright blue sky dominates the upper half, with thin cables in the top-left and a green lens flare below them.
end of description.
The viewpoint slowly shifts left, introducing a thick dark grey pole with a partially visible blue street sign from the far left by the sixth frame. Subsequently, a "Bernina Lagalb" sign attached to this pole becomes fully visible on the left before the pole and signs completely exit the frame to the left, restoring the original mountain vista.

A vast snow-covered mountain landscape fills the first frame under a clear blue sky, featuring a snow-covered foreground with shadows and three thin wooden polesâ€”a taller one on the left, and two others further right. The midground presents a snow-covered hill dotted with coniferous and deciduous trees, leading to majestic snow-capped mountains in the background.

As the viewpoint progresses forward and slightly right, a small black rectangular marker with a white stripe emerges in the bottom left foreground by frame 4, previously just out of sight to the left of the initial viewpoint. By frame 6, a 'Bernina Lagalb' sign becomes clearly visible, attached to the tall wooden pole that was already on the left, now prominent and very close to the viewer. The viewpoint then moves past this pole, revealing a new small red and yellow marker on another pole further left in the mid-background, which was previously obscured or outside the initial frame's left edge.

In the first frame, a vast snow-covered mountain landscape is visible under a clear blue sky, which dominates the upper half of the image. In the mid-ground, a gray utility pole stands prominently on the left with horizontal wires extending across the frame, bearing a small yellow and red marker. Further to the right and slightly behind, a thinner wooden utility pole also supports wires. The foreground features undulating snow-covered terrain with shadows, while the background reveals snow-capped mountains adorned with scattered dark and golden-brown trees.

end of description

The viewpoint steadily advances forward, causing the leftmost utility pole and its wires to shift progressively towards the left edge of the frame, revealing more of the snow-covered mountain landscape previously partially obscured to the right of the pole's initial position. The wooden utility pole in the mid-right also moves left relative to the frame, passing by the viewer. A small, dark sign appears on the snowy ground, initially to the left of the wooden pole's first position and progressively moves leftward across the frame. Footprints in the snow become more pronounced in the foreground, and a lens flare appears in the upper-left from frame seven onwards.
