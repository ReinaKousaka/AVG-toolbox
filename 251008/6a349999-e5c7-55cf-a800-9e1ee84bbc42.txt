The first frame depicts a rainy city street at night, featuring a dark pole with a '30' speed limit sign in the foreground left, and a tall illuminated sign pole with Korean text and three red lights centrally located. A white sedan with headlights on rests on the wet street to the left of the central pole, with buildings lining the background left and right.

The white sedan (revealed to be a taxi) then begins moving forward on the street to the left, while a distant traffic light in the center changes from red to green. As the taxi exits the frame to the left, a second white car emerges from behind it, continuing to advance on the wet street.

The first frame depicts a rainy night scene at a city intersection, viewed from a street-level perspective. A tall black pole with a vertical illuminated sign featuring Korean text and colored circles stands prominently in the center-left foreground, displaying a red traffic light. To the immediate left, a multi-story building with storefronts, some closed with horizontal blinds, is visible, featuring Korean signage. The wet asphalt road, reflecting the red traffic lights and other street illumination, extends into the midground where several more red traffic lights and utility poles mark a complex intersection. In the mid-right, a dark figure with an umbrella stands on a sidewalk adjacent to another building with Korean signs, while distant buildings and the dark, rain-streaked sky form the background.

Between frames 1 and 4, the traffic lights on the central pole and further down the road to the right remain red. By frame 5, the traffic light on the central pole dynamically changes from red to green, with the distant traffic lights at the intersection also switching to green. The steady, heavy rain continues to be visible across all frames. From frame 6 onwards, a white car becomes visible in the mid-right, appearing to move forward away from the viewer, while a subtle figure also emerges further down the street to the right.

A rainy night scene depicts a wet urban street and sidewalks, reflecting the glow of numerous streetlights and red traffic signals ahead, with buildings lining both sides of the street and a person holding an umbrella visible on the right sidewalk.
end of description
The rain continues to fall consistently across all frames. The traffic lights in the middle distance transition from red to green, and a car with illuminated headlights subtly approaches from the distance on the right side of the street, its reflection visible on the wet asphalt.
