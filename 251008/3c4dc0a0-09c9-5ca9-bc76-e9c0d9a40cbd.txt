The first frame depicts a bustling night street filled with a dense crowd of people walking, primarily seen from behind in the foreground and midground. Tall, illuminated buildings flank the street; on the left, a large billboard features an anime character and "DMM" text, with "大盛堂書店" below, while the right building shows a prominent IKEA sign above a multi-story glass facade. end of description. As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward, advancing into and through the crowd. Individuals in the immediate foreground, like the person with a dark backpack on the far right, subtly shift positions and move slightly further away, continuously revealing new people and a slightly extended view of the street ahead of the first-frame viewpoint.

Concurrently, luggage becomes visible next to a person on the right midground.
