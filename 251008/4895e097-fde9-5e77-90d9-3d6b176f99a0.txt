A cobblestone street, featuring two smooth parallel strips, extends from the foreground towards hazy mountains in the background under a clear sky. In the foreground-midground, a silver station wagon is parked to the left beneath a yellow and red Shell gas station canopy, which is attached to a multi-story building, while a multi-story building on the right features a ground-floor window displaying "made in."
end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the street, the silver station wagon and the immediate Shell canopy recede and move out of frame to the left. The buildings on both sides simultaneously recede, revealing more of their facades, including upper-story windows, balconies on the left, and a green "TRUMER" sign on the right, as new sections of the street and buildings come into view relative to the initial frame's position. The distant mountains appear to shift backward as the viewer moves forward through the scene.

First, the viewer looks down a cobblestone street with a yellow building featuring red shutters and a balcony to the left, and a green building with a 'TRENDBY' sign to the right. Ahead, a large yellow-brown hotel building with balconies and a white car parked in front is visible, while misty mountains rise in the distant background. end of description. As the viewpoint moves forward, the "TRENDBY" sign on the right building fully reveals "TREND BY SHOP" on its facade, along with clearer mannequins inside the shop window, all previously to the right and slightly beyond the first-frame's right edge. Concurrently, the yellow building on the left recedes relatively, showing more of its lower facade, and the mid-ground hotel and parked car ahead appear slightly larger.

The first frame presents a cobblestone street with smooth tracks, curving gently to the right, bordered by buildings under a clear sky with distant mountains. On the left is a light-yellow building with red-shuttered windows and a '253' sign, while the right features a 'TREND BY SHOP' building with a vertical 'TREND BY' sign. Further ahead in the center, a multi-story building with balconies is visible, with a white car parked to its left.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the street from the initial viewpoint, the buildings on both sides become more prominent and closer, revealing new sections like shop entrances and window displays. The '253' sign on the left building moves out of view to the left, and the white car previously parked ahead on the left also disappears from the frame. The scene ahead opens up, showing more of the street, shop interiors on the right, and people walking further down towards the distant mountains.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a cobblestone street with two smoother, parallel tracks running down its center, curving gently to the right in the distance. To the left, a multi-story, light yellow building with brown wooden balconies, labeled "Alpenhotel Schlossli," stands prominently, with a dark car parked nearby and a blue "P" parking sign. A tall, grey building with large, reflective windows occupies the right side of the foreground. In the background, majestic mountains rise under a clear blue sky, partially obscured by some clouds, and bright sunlight illuminates the left side of the scene.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the grey building to the right of the first-frame viewpoint becomes more prominent, and its windows reveal more interior detail. The yellow hotel building, initially to the left, also approaches, revealing a "Coop" sign on its ground floor. A yellow parking barrier, previously somewhat obscured by the blue sign and to the left of the initial central path, becomes fully visible and shifts slightly left relative to the first frame's center as the camera progresses. The dark car, initially parked on the far left of the first frame, gradually recedes from view.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a cobblestone street with two paved strips leading forward, flanked by buildings. On the left, a multi-story yellow "Alpenhotel Schilderli" building sits above a "coop" store, with a white car and a yellow-and-black striped pole with signs in front. A grey building with windows is on the right, partially obscuring the view, while distant mountains under a blue sky appear straight ahead in the background.
end of description
As the viewpoint gradually moves forward along the street, the yellow-and-black striped pole and white car on the left slowly shift further to the viewer's left, moving out of their initial prominent foreground positions. Simultaneously, more of the grey building on the right side of the frame becomes visible, revealing additional windows and facade details relative to the viewer's progressing position. Throughout the sequence, individuals near the 'coop' entrance and further down the street are observed in various states of movement within their respective areas.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a street scene framed by buildings on either side, leading towards distant mountains under a blue sky. To the left, a light yellow multi-story building with wooden balconies, labeled "Alpenhotel Schlossel," sits above a "coop" supermarket, with people gathered outside near a white car and bicycles. Opposite, to the right, a grey building with numerous windows borders the cobblestone street, which extends from the viewer's foreground into the midground, where several pedestrians are visible. In the background, green mountains rise prominently beneath a sky dotted with white clouds.
end of description
In subsequent frames, a person in a red jacket and light pants walks from the left sidewalk past the 'coop' store into the midground, eventually moving out of the frame to the right. Other pedestrians further down the cobblestone street in the midground also continue walking away from the viewer. The buildings, mountains, white car, and bicycles remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint, with no notable changes in the scene's overall composition.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a street scene bordered by buildings, leading towards distant mountains under a blue sky. To the viewer's immediate left stands a light yellow building with a wooden balcony and a storefront, where a person is partially visible near a parked black bicycle. On the right, a light gray building with a partially visible "RAIFFEISEN" sign flanks the cobblestone street. Directly ahead, the street extends into the midground, revealing more buildings, yellow flags, and two distant figures walking towards the viewer, with green mountains forming the background.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward into the scene. The yellow building on the left increasingly reveals its "COOP" sign, while the "RAIFFEISEN" sign on the right building also becomes more prominent as the viewer approaches. A person initially on the far left foreground walks rightward across the viewer's immediate path, passing the bicycle. Concurrently, two figures in the midground on the left side of the street steadily advance closer towards the viewer's original position.
