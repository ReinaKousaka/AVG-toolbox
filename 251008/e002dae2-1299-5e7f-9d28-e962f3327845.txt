The first frame displays a rainy city street with a wet crosswalk stretching across the foreground. Buildings line both sides of the street under an overcast sky, with a black SUV visible in the left lane and parked cars alongside a sidewalk on the right. Overhead traffic lights displaying red are positioned in the midground to the right.

Subsequently, a person holding a light pink umbrella emerges onto the far left of the crosswalk, walking away from the viewer. This individual then proceeds across the street from left to right, moving further into the scene. Concurrently, the black SUV continues its slow movement forward, and a red bus briefly appears behind it further down the street.
