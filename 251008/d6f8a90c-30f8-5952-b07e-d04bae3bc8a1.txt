In the first frame, the viewer looks slightly upward into a rocky, leaf-strewn gully. Numerous light brown fallen leaves cover the ground, interspersed with large, light grey rocks, especially in the foreground and extending into the midground. Several bare-branched trees with light-colored trunks stand centrally and to the left in the midground, while a steep, rocky dirt slope rises on the right and a less distinct slope on the left, both covered in leaves and sparse vegetation. A clear blue sky is visible above the trees and slopes.

The viewpoint slowly moves forward and slightly upward through the gully. Foreground rocks and fallen leaves recede from view as new sections of the leaf-covered ground and additional rocks are revealed ahead. The bare tree trunks and rocky slopes on both sides of the path gradually shift to the left as the camera advances deeper into the scene.

The first frame depicts a forest floor blanketed in brown and orange autumn leaves. In the foreground, several large light-colored rocks are situated to the lower-left and center-left of the viewer, with a fallen branch lying on the ground to the right. Bare-branched trees with light bark dominate the midground, extending upwards, while a steep, rocky hillside with sparse vegetation rises in the background to the right under a bright blue sky.
end of description
The viewpoint moves steadily forward and slightly to the left, revealing more of the path. The large rocks initially in the foreground progressively shift past the viewer to the left and behind, as the bases of the central trees and other scattered rocks further ahead become more prominent and closer within the frame.

The first frame displays an autumn forest scene with fallen brown leaves covering the ground. A cluster of trees with thick, dark trunks dominates the left foreground, their roots spreading outwards, while several large rocks are scattered across the lower center and right. In the midground, more trees with bare branches and some yellow foliage stretch into the distance, and a rocky cliff face rises steeply on the far right. A clear blue sky is visible above through the tree canopy.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly progresses forward and subtly to the right. The prominent tree trunks on the left grow larger and shift further to the viewer's immediate left, revealing more of their roots. Concurrently, the large rock in the right foreground recedes to the viewer's right, unveiling additional smaller rocks and an expanding view of the rocky cliff face on the far right that was initially partially obscured. The overall scene deepens as the viewer moves through the forest.
