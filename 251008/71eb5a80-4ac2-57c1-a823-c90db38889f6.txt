The first frame shows a forward-facing view down two train tracks receding into the distance, curving slightly right. Overhead power lines span across a bright blue sky, supported by a utility pole visible on the mid-left. To the immediate left, a dark shadow covers an embankment and bushes, beyond which a red-roofed house is partially seen, while the right side is bordered by a dense line of green trees.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the embankment and the initial red-roofed house on the far left recede and eventually move out of frame. A new, more distant house with a yellow roof emerges to the far left. On the right, the dense treeline moves past, revealing a tall white pole with a red top further in the distance. The tracks continue to curve right, bringing more of the trackside vegetation and sky into view as the train progresses.
