The first frame depicts a street view looking forward. To the viewer's immediate left, a sidewalk runs alongside a multi-story building featuring yellow and brown facades with ground-level storefronts, and a black lamppost stands prominently near the viewer. On the right, another multi-story brick building with balconies fronts the street, where several cars are parked bumper-to-bumper, extending towards the mid-ground. Further down the street, additional buildings are visible on both sides, and the road gently curves left under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The lamppost on the left sidewalk gradually moves from being immediately to the viewer's left to receding further into the background relative to the initial viewpoint. A person begins walking away from the viewer on the left sidewalk, moving towards the distant buildings. Simultaneously, the parked cars on the right side appear to recede towards the background, and new vehicles replace some of those originally visible further down the street. New sections of the street and buildings, previously ahead of the first-frame viewpoint, are continuously revealed.

The first frame depicts a city street looking forward, bordered by multi-story buildings with ground-floor shops on both sides; a person walks on the left sidewalk, and several cars are parked along the right. The paved road, with white markings, leads towards a distant intersection visible under a partially cloudy sky.

end of description

As the viewpoint steadily advances down the street, the person on the left exits the frame. Concurrently, a blue and green public phone booth on the mid-left, initially partially obscured by a lamppost, becomes fully revealed and closer, while a motorcycle appears parked among cars on the mid-right, previously unseen.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a city street looking forward, featuring a pedestrian crossing ahead, flanked by tall reddish-brown buildings with shops on both the left and right. Traffic lights are visible on both sidewalks, a blue/green box on the far left, and a parked car with a scooter to the immediate right.
end of description
As the perspective moves forward, the car, scooter, and traffic light on the right disappear by the third frame. The blue/green box and the traffic light on the left then progressively move out of view as the camera advances past them. Subsequently, a red and blue circular sign emerges on a lamppost along the left sidewalk, while the street ahead and the buildings further down the block become more prominent.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A paved street extends straight ahead, flanked by sidewalks. On the left, a multi-story building with shopfronts lines the sidewalk, featuring a prominent black lamppost with a red 'no parking' sign in the foreground. On the right, another multi-story building stands, with a black metal fence and two large, round green trees in the mid-ground. The background shows more buildings under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the street. The lamppost with the 'no parking' sign on the left side moves progressively closer and eventually out of the frame to the immediate left. As the camera advances, the buildings on both sides slide past, and the two large trees on the right are revealed to be part of a small park area with a crosswalk and a car behind them, becoming more distinct in the foreground. People walking on the sidewalks and across the street in the distance also become more visible.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a paved street, looking down a city avenue. To the immediate left is a sidewalk with a prominent tree and the facade of a multi-story building, displaying a green 'PRIMERKA' sign and a green 'P' logo. The asphalt road stretches into the distance, marked by a double white line and a yellow line near the left curb. To the right, beyond a narrow sidewalk and a black fence, is a small green space with two large, round trees, and a person walking a small white dog. Further right, a red car is partially visible. Buildings line both sides of the street, receding into the background, with a bright sky overhead.
end of description
The camera moves forward along the street. As the viewpoint advances, the initial tree on the left recedes behind the viewer, revealing additional storefronts, lampposts, and smaller trees in planters along the left sidewalk, progressively appearing from the midground. On the right, the person and dog move further forward from their initial position and eventually exit the frame to the right of the original viewpoint, while the large trees and the building behind them continue to recede. The street's perspective shifts as more of the road ahead and the buildings further down the street are continuously revealed from the original forward view.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a moderately wide city street receding into the distance, bordered by multi-story buildings with ground-level shops on both the left and right; a small, manicured tree in a planter is prominent on the left sidewalk closest to the viewer, while a larger, dense-canopied tree within a fenced green space is on the right.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the street, the initial manicured tree on the left moves out of frame, revealing more of the shopfronts. Simultaneously, a bus stop shelter with people waiting appears on the right side of the street, replacing the initially closer large tree and green area. Further down the left sidewalk, ornate lampposts become visible, and the buildings on both sides appear closer, revealing more architectural details and shop signs directly ahead of the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a wide city street extending into the distance under a partly cloudy sky. Directly in front, an asphalt road with white and yellow markings leads forward, flanked by sidewalks on both sides. On the left sidewalk, storefronts like "PIZZA ITALIANA" are visible, along with an ornate black street lamp featuring a prominent red and blue "no parking" sign attached, and several potted, manicured trees. On the right, similarly, buildings with shops line the sidewalk, where a bus stop with two individuals and another ornate street lamp are present further down. Multi-story buildings of varying colors (tan/brown on the left, reddish-orange on the right) stretch along both sides, receding into the background where the street appears to curve slightly.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily moves forward down the street. The prominent 'no parking' sign and its lamp on the left, and the bus stop on the right, gradually move out of frame to their respective sides, revealing more of the street ahead. Consequently, previously mid-ground buildings and shops on both sides now appear closer to the viewer, bringing new storefronts and architectural details into the foreground.
