The first frame features a lush garden in the foreground with a large green bush on the right and a lawn with various plants in the center. In the mid-ground, a multi-story traditional building with dark wooden siding, numerous windows with green shutters, and climbing vines dominates, flanked by parts of other buildings to its immediate left and right. Distant mountains rise in the background under a partly cloudy sky.

Following frames show a slow panning motion to the right. The large bush in the immediate foreground on the right gradually moves out of the frame towards the right, simultaneously revealing a brown tiled roof that was previously partially obscured behind it, appearing in the lower right corner. As the camera continues to pan right, more of the modern building located to the right of the central structure, including its orange-colored base and upper balcony, becomes visible, along with a larger expanse of the distant mountains further to its right.
