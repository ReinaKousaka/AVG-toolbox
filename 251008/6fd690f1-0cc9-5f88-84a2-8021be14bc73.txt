The first frame displays a paved road in the lower center, flanked on the left by a stone wall topped with a wooden picket fence and green shrubs. To the right of the road, a small, dark brown wooden house with a blue-tiled roof and light wooden door stands in the midground, with a taller, multi-story dark brown wooden building featuring a reddish roof and many windows behind it. More dark wooden buildings with red roofs and green trees are partially visible on the left, while towering grey, snow-capped mountains are seen in the distant background under a cloudy blue sky.

The camera executes a subtle pull-back and shifts slightly left, gradually widening the field of view. This motion reveals more of the paved road receding further into the scene. Consequently, additional sections of the dark wooden buildings on the left side of the frame become visible. The distant snow-capped mountains on the right also appear marginally wider within the overall scene.

The first frame presents a village scene with a paved road curving slightly right from the viewer's foreground, leading towards several traditional wooden buildings. To the viewer's left, a picket fence and green bushes line the road, while on the right, a smaller wooden house with a 'Au Gl√ºtsch' sign stands in the midground, with larger multi-story wooden buildings and distant snow-capped mountains behind it.

Subsequently, two dark pigeons appear on the road in the mid-left foreground, near the bushes, and gradually move forward and to the right along the road. They walk a short distance before one pigeon turns around, remaining in the mid-left portion of the street relative to the initial viewpoint.
