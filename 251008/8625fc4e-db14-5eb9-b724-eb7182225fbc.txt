The first frame displays an urban street scene with a person in dark clothing walking away from the viewer on a crosswalk in the foreground. To the viewer's right, a sidewalk features several pedestrians, a black mailbox, a street light with a 'ONE WAY' sign, and a partially visible red fire hydrant. To the viewer's left, a street contains multiple stationary vehicles including a white van, black SUVs, a yellow taxi, and a blue bus, with a white car partially seen on the far left. Tall modern glass buildings line the background on the left, while other buildings extend into the background on the right.
end of description
The person in the foreground continues walking away from the viewer along the crosswalk, progressing further into the midground. Pedestrians on the sidewalk to the right also gradually move, some approaching the crosswalk while others walk away from the viewer. The vehicles on the street in the midground remain largely stationary. A red fire hydrant and additional pedestrians become more visible on the far right as the scene progresses.
