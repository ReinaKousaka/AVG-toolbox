The first frame displays a wet asphalt path in the foreground, leading up to a two-story building on the left. The building's ground floor features a light-colored wall with a dark brown door slightly to the right of center, and a blue 'P' parking sign is visible to the left of the door. Above this, a wooden balcony heavily adorned with green vines extends across the upper floor, from which two light green spherical lanterns hang. To the right of the door, on the ground, are potted plants with red flowers and green foliage, prominently featuring a red Swiss flag. A narrow, wet asphalt road ascends uphill into the distance on the right, bordered by a stone wall covered in greenery; a dark SUV is parked on this road, facing away from the viewer, and further up the slope, a small wooden building is visible against a backdrop of hazy mountains under an overcast sky.
end of description
Beginning from the fifth frame, a small brown and white dog appears on the ground to the right of the potted plants and Swiss flag, facing towards the uphill road. Subsequently, from the seventh frame, the dark brown door on the building's ground floor starts to open, gradually revealing a dark interior behind it, while the dog remains in its newly revealed position.
