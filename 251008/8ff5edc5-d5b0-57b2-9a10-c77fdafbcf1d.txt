The first frame shows a bustling street scene. To the immediate right, the front portion of a black SUV is visible on the asphalt street. On the far left, a building's glass entrance and several orange traffic barriers line the sidewalk. Directly ahead, a large digital billboard, supported by poles, displays green and red text, behind which is a red storefront with vending-machine-like structures and blue banners. To the right of the billboard, a multi-story building marked "MARUHAN" features a brightly lit entrance with additional blue banners and a person standing nearby. Distant buildings recede along the street to the right and left.
end of description
The black SUV proceeds forward, gradually revealing its entire rear as it moves away from the viewer and slightly to the left. A pedestrian, wearing a patterned jacket and a cap, emerges into view in the mid-right, walking away from the viewer and to the left. Further down the street on the left, a white van becomes visible as the SUV clears the view.
