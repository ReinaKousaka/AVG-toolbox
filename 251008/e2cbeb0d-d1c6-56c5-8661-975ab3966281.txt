In the first frame, a narrow asphalt road extends into the distance from the viewer's lower center. To the immediate left, a stone retaining wall rises, topped by a sidewalk with lush green potted plants. Behind this, a white building with red window boxes and outdoor furniture is visible, followed by a rustic brown wooden building with more red flowers, forming the left side of the scene. People are seated at outdoor tables further down the sidewalk to the left, and others walk along the road. On the right side of the road, a dark grey car is positioned, facing away from the viewer. Further down the road, on the right, a prominent light yellow multi-story building with a red and white flag (Swiss flag) on its facade stands against a backdrop of towering green mountains covered in dense coniferous trees. The sky above is clear blue.
end of description
As the frames progress, the dark grey car on the right side of the road moves forward and slightly further away from the viewer. The camera also performs a subtle, slow zoom out and a slight pan to the right, widening the view and revealing a bit more of the distant road and the base of the mountains on the right side, relative to the initial viewpoint. The people on the left side of the road continue their movement further into the scene, away from the viewer.
