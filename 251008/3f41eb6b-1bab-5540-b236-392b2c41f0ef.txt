The first frame depicts a paved path stretching forward, flanked by concrete barriers: the left barrier separates it from green grass and a steep, tree-covered mountain slope with a stepped gabion wall, while the right barrier borders a multi-lane highway featuring a distant dark car and another rocky mountain slope beyond, all under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the immediate surroundings pass by, revealing more of the gabion wall on the left mountain slope which grows larger in the frame. The dark car on the highway approaches the viewer from the distant mid-ground, passes to the viewer's right, and then recedes into the background. A yellow diamond-shaped sign also becomes visible on the right side of the highway as the path progresses.
