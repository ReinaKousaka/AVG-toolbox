The first frame displays a forward view down two sets of train tracks, where the left track curves left beside a brown hillside. To the right of the tracks, a dirt area with construction equipment precedes a town nestled against steep, tree-covered mountains, with a sunlit, snow-capped mountain in the distant left and overhead railway lines.

As the frames advance, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks. Foreground elements like the construction equipment to the right of the initial position recede, revealing more of the road and fence previously behind them, while the town and mountains continuously shift perspective as the train proceeds into the valley.

The first frame shows the viewer positioned above train tracks curving left into the distance, with a bridge crossing over them in the midground. To the left, a brown hillside leads up to sunlit mountains with snow patches, while to the right, multiple buildings with red roofs and another set of tracks are visible, backed by darker, forested mountains and several utility poles. 'Vmax: 60KM/h' is displayed in the bottom left.

As the train moves forward, a yellow marker sign to the right clarifies, first showing '20' and then '425 0', while a signal pole on the right side of the tracks comes into view, displaying a red light as it passes. Simultaneously, a signal pole on the left side with green lights and text becomes more prominent. The viewer gets closer to the bridge ahead as the surrounding landscape dynamically shifts, with objects on both sides of the tracks moving past the viewing perspective.

The first frame displays a view from a train moving forward on parallel tracks that converge and then diverge, leading towards a concrete bridge spanning overhead. To the left, a sunlit, rugged mountain rises steeply, while to the right, a slope covered in dry brown vegetation ascends to a village with white and red-roofed buildings nestled against a darker mountain. Overhead power lines crisscross the sky, and a yellow '425 0' sign is positioned to the left of the tracks.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the train switches from the leftmost track onto the central track, causing the tracks to the right to visually shift leftward relative to the viewpoint and become closer. A tall utility pole with signal structures to the right of the tracks, initially partially obscured, becomes fully visible, revealing a signal light that rotates from a horizontal to an upward-angled position.
