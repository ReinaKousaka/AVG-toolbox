A blonde woman in a white jacket stands in the bottom-left foreground, facing left, on a paved pedestrian walkway. To her right, a glass-paneled bus shelter with a person and reflections of seated individuals extends into the midground. On the left, a multi-level building with planters featuring green foliage is illuminated, all under a night sky with distant city lights.

The blonde woman exits the frame to the left. Concurrently, the person in the bus shelter moves right, standing by an advertising screen that first reveals a 'TESCO' logo, then changes to display bottles of champagne.

In the first frame, a person in a dark jacket with a bag stands in the right foreground, looking at an advertisement on a bus stop shelter, with a black trash can to their left on a paved sidewalk. On the far left, a planter with spiky foliage borders the sidewalk, which extends into the midground where several pedestrians walk away from the viewer. To the right, beyond the bus stop, a road with a red traffic light and a stationary black taxi is visible, with tall, illuminated buildings in the background under a dark night sky.
end of description
The person in the right foreground turns and walks away along the sidewalk, revealing more of the bus stop. Simultaneously, the black taxi on the road begins to move forward past the bus stop, and a bus appears from behind the bus stop shelter, moving left across the midground road. Other pedestrians on the sidewalk continue moving further into the distance.

The first frame displays a nighttime urban street scene with a paved sidewalk stretching into the distance. On the immediate left, large leafy plants fill a raised planter, beside which several pedestrians walk away from the viewer. To the right, a black litter bin stands adjacent to a glass bus stop shelter, with a road beyond showing a black taxi halted at a red traffic light. Tall buildings with illuminated windows line the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk, causing the litter bin and bus stop shelter on the right to shift towards the foreground, while the person in the purple jacket on the sidewalk moves further away from the viewer.

The first frame shows a nighttime city street scene. To the immediate left, a large potted plant in a wooden barrel-like planter occupies the foreground. A paved sidewalk extends from the bottom center into the distance, with a woman in a red coat and purple scarf walking towards the viewer, carrying a pink bag. Further down the sidewalk, more pedestrians are visible, receding into the midground. To the right of the sidewalk, a glass bus stop shelter with yellow benches is present. A prominent red 'NEW ROAD LAYOUT AHEAD' sign stands on a pole to the right of the bus stop, above a white 'BUS STOP SK' sign. In the background right, a street with a black taxi and another car is stopped at a red traffic light, with illuminated storefronts and buildings across the street. Tall buildings with lit windows are visible further in the background.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the woman on the sidewalk steadily approaches the viewer, becoming larger and more central in the foreground. The black taxi and the vehicle behind it on the street to the right show minimal forward movement, suggesting a slight progression in traffic flow. No new objects or scenes are revealed; rather, the existing elements shift their positions relative to the stationary viewpoint.

In the first frame, a person wearing a reddish-brown jacket and a purple scarf walks towards the viewer on the left side of a paved sidewalk. To the right of the viewer, a glass and metal bus stop shelter extends into the midground. Along the left side of the sidewalk, lush green plants and bushes are visible behind a low barrier. Further in the midground, other pedestrians walk along the illuminated pavement towards buildings in the distance, while streetlights line the scene. In the background, across a street beyond the bus stop, illuminated buildings and a red traffic light are visible.
end of description
The person in the foreground walks past the viewer and out of the frame to the left, revealing more of the paved sidewalk and the low barrier with plants on that side. No new objects are revealed from the first-frame viewpoint; the primary dynamic change is the movement of the foreground figure. The bus stop shelter remains on the right, and the distant street scene with other pedestrians and buildings stays relatively fixed.
