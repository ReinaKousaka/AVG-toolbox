A wet city street at night is seen from a low angle. A light-colored bus partially occupies the lower-left, while a large tree trunk stands in the mid-right foreground, obscuring some of the scene. To the right of the tree, two purple electric scooters are parked on the sidewalk. Pedestrians with umbrellas cross a zebra-marked street in the mid-ground, where cars with headlights are visible, and buildings with illuminated signs line the background.

The bus on the left moves forward, exiting the frame to the left, revealing more of the street and buildings. Simultaneously, the viewer's perspective shifts rightward, causing the tree trunk to move to the far-right foreground and then partially exit the frame. This shift unveils a broader view of the wet street and the buildings on the left, previously obscured by the bus and the tree. Traffic lights in the middle ground change colors, and pedestrians continue crossing the street as vehicles move in the distance.
