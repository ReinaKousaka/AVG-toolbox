In the first frame, a wet urban sidewalk extends from the bottom of the frame into the midground on the left, bordered by a dark gray curb and a yellow tactile paving strip. To the viewer's right, a dark metal railing runs parallel to the sidewalk, separating it from a multi-lane wet road where a red bus with illuminated headlights is visible in the midground, moving away from the viewer. Further along the sidewalk on the left, a person wearing a blue shirt and shorts holds a black umbrella, standing next to a low green hedge and a white fence. Several trees with dark trunks line the sidewalk between the viewer and the bus, while distant buildings are faintly visible through heavy rain in the background, beneath an overcast sky.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the red bus in the midground continues to move further away from the viewer down the road. Other vehicles on the wet road also proceed, maintaining their forward motion relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Pedestrians on the far side of the road subtly shift their positions. The person holding the black umbrella on the sidewalk in the midground remains largely stationary, while the falling rain consistently splashes on all visible surfaces.
