A paved road extends into the distance, flanked by a building with wooden siding and green shutters on the right, and a low railing with trees and a silver van parked behind it on the left. In the midground, another silver van is parked with its tailgate open and several people gathered around it on the right side of the road, in front of a building adorned with Swiss and Bernese flags, all set against towering rocky mountains in the background.

A dark grey van enters from the bottom-left foreground, moving forward and to the right. It proceeds past the viewer, revealing its rear profile, and travels further down the road into the midground, obscuring parts of the left side of the scene. The van continues to recede into the distance, passing the gathering of people and the parked silver van. It gradually exits the frame to the right midground, fully revealing the street and storefront on the right that were previously obscured.

In the first frame, a paved road stretches into the midground, bordered by a sidewalk on the right and a metal barrier with a light-colored minivan on the left. A brown building with storefronts displaying a 'Dorfb√§ckerei' sign occupies the right foreground. Further down, a dark SUV is parked with its trunk open, in front of a wooden building adorned with Swiss and bear flags, all set against towering grey mountains in the background. Two women are visible walking on the right sidewalk in the midground.
end of description
The two women on the right sidewalk, initially in the midground, steadily walk towards the viewer in subsequent frames. Other pedestrians further down the street also move progressively closer to the first-frame viewpoint. By the final frame, these two women are prominently in the right foreground on the sidewalk, approaching the viewer's immediate position.
