The first frame displays a wide view of a wet city street intersection. In the immediate foreground, a white SUV faces the viewer, positioned slightly right of center, while other vehicles recede further down the street. To the left, a tall building houses a Chase bank at ground level, with pedestrians crossing a crosswalk and walking on the sidewalk. On the right, another multi-story building features various storefronts and a large billboard displaying advertisements above outdoor seating with blue umbrellas. The street extends into the background, flanked by towering buildings beneath a grey sky.

As the frames progress, the white SUV in the center foreground steadily approaches the viewer. Simultaneously, pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue their movement, crossing the street from left to right. More of the traffic light's upper structure and yellow signal heads become visible, extending further into the frame from the far right. Other vehicles in the mid-ground also advance slightly towards the viewer.
