A wet, stone-paved alley is visible, lined with traditional buildings and shops under an overcast sky. To the left, a person holding a green umbrella walks away from the viewer, under a large blue canopy next to a wooden lattice. On the right, a storefront displays colorful umbrellas and fans, adorned with red lanterns and a brown awning.
end of description
The person with the green umbrella consistently moves further down the alley away from the viewer. Subsequently, a red bucket appears on the wet pavement to the mid-left, and then a blue bucket emerges even further down the alley on the left side.
