A cobblestone street fills the foreground, leading towards three buildings and a distant valley. On the left are a yellow-orange building with green shutters and an adjacent red building. To the right, a light yellow building stands beside an upward-sloping cobblestone path, with a small brown wooden structure in front of it. Beyond these structures, a verdant valley stretches under a clear blue sky, flanked by two tall trees behind the rightmost building.

In the second frame, two red chairs appear to the viewer's immediate left. A small black dog then emerges in frame four, walking across the central opening between the buildings towards the right. By frame six, the black dog is nearing the rightmost wooden structure, and a small white dog appears near the red chairs on the left, along with a green chair. Simultaneously, a person becomes more distinct, ascending the cobblestone path on the far right. The white dog subsequently moves further left, remaining near the chairs as the person on the path continues their ascent.
