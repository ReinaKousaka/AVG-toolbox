In the first frame, a street scene unfolds with a crosswalk in the immediate foreground. To the left, a portion of a white sculptural object is visible near the curb, while a line of parked cars extends down the street to the mid-left. A silver car is positioned on the road near the center, with a cyclist to its right, approaching the viewer's right. On the far right, a construction site is prominently fenced off, featuring a building largely covered in scaffolding and white netting, with a yellow crane visible behind it; an orange traffic cone and a red barrier stand in front of the fence, alongside a traffic light pole.
end of description
The cyclist in the foreground moves from the right side of the crosswalk further to the right, eventually exiting the frame from the right. Concurrently, the silver car in the midground moves forward, passing over the crosswalk. The line of cars to the left also advances forward, with the white sedan previously behind the silver car now closer to the center of the road. Finally, a new silver car enters the frame from the far right, moving towards the viewer, obscuring the traffic cone and red barrier.

In the first frame, an asphalt road with a broken white line extends from the foreground into the distance. To the far right, part of a white car is visible moving towards the viewer, while to the far left, a dark SUV is parked on a sidewalk, followed by a silver sedan and other cars further back. Along the right side of the road, a tall, grey construction fence runs parallel to the viewer, behind which a large building under construction, partially covered in scaffolding and translucent sheeting, is seen, with a yellow crane boom extending upwards. On the left side, beyond the parked cars, a row of trees lines the street, with buildings visible behind them and in the distance. The bright sky above shows a sun flare in the upper left.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the road, the white car on the right foreground moves further away from the viewer. Simultaneously, the construction fence to the right reveals more of its length and a black streetlight post emerges from behind it. The building under construction and the yellow crane to the right of the viewpoint become more centrally positioned in the frame, while cars on the left move further into the distance.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a bright urban street scene with several cars parked along the curb on the left foreground, the nearest being a dark SUV partially visible. A white car drives away from the viewer in the center of the road, which has what appear to be tram tracks on the right. To the right, a corrugated metal fence shields a construction site featuring a building enclosed in translucent scaffolding, while trees and distant buildings are visible in the background under a sunny sky with a sun flare on the left.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the parked cars on the far left recede out of frame, and the white car ahead moves further away. A prominent white arrow appears on the road directly in front of the viewer, and the construction site on the right, along with an overhead street light structure that becomes visible, grows larger and reveals more details relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on an asphalt road with a prominent white arrow pointing forward in the immediate foreground. To the right, a long metal fence borders a construction site with visible scaffolding and a large structural framework behind it, accompanied by orange cones at the pavement edge. On the left, a paved sidewalk features several bollards, a red and white 'Public Parking' sign, and parked cars further back alongside a building. Ahead on the road, a silver car is visible, moving away from the viewer, while multiple trees line the street on the left, partially obscuring distant buildings. The sky is bright, with a strong sun flare in the upper-left corner.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the white arrow on the road disappears from the bottom of the frame. The 'Public Parking' sign and bollards on the left progressively recede and move out of view to the left of the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the silver car ahead remains in view, while a white van becomes visible further down the road, positioned ahead of the silver car. A pedestrian appears on the left sidewalk, walking in the same direction as the viewer. New road markings, including a "30", become visible on the road ahead.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a sunny street scene with a paved road leading forward, bordered by a curb and a pedestrian plaza on the left, and a gray mesh fence on the right. A stationary silver car, followed by a white van and another vehicle, occupies the mid-ground ahead, while a pedestrian walks away on the plaza to the left. Tall buildings flank both sides in the background, with a bright sun high in the upper left casting strong glare.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the pedestrian continues to walk further away on the left, moving along the plaza. The vehicles positioned ahead on the road remain entirely stationary, maintaining their initial spatial relationship to the first-frame viewpoint. No other objects or the broader environment undergo any dynamic changes, aside from slight shifts in the sun's glare.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, the viewer faces a city street on a sunny day with bright sunlight flaring from the upper left. A pedestrian walks on the left sidewalk, bordered by dark planter boxes and trees, with a prominent 'Give Way' sign and a "Traffic subject to working train" sign positioned further along. Ahead on the road, a silver car is followed by a darker car and a white van, all moving towards a grand, multi-story building with ornate architecture in the background. To the right, a temporary white construction fence partially obscures a site, marked by an orange truck-on-ramp sign and several orange bollards, all beneath dense green tree foliage.
end of description
The pedestrian on the left sidewalk continues walking forward and left, progressively moving out of the frame. Simultaneously, the temporary construction fence and the orange truck-on-ramp sign on the right move out of view to the right, gradually revealing more of the construction site and an orange barrier behind them. The viewpoint subtly shifts forward and pans slightly right, causing the 'Give Way' sign to appear closer and the building on the far left to recede from view.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a street scene with a silver car directly in front of the viewer on a paved road, followed by a dark car and a white van. To the left, there are large planter boxes, several trees, and a lamppost, with a multi-story building featuring classical architecture prominently in the background. Overhead, leafy tree branches are visible, and sunlight flares from the upper left.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the silver car gradually moves forward relative to the viewer's initial position, revealing more of the dark car behind it and the road surface previously obscured. The entire queue of vehicles slowly advances forward within the scene.
