The first frame displays an urban pedestrian passage looking forward between two modern buildings, viewed from a wide perspective. To the viewer's left, a person in a green vest stands with their back mostly turned, facing a temporary white wall with posters, situated beside a tall glass-fronted building. To the right, a 'LUFT COFFEE' shop with visible patrons occupies the base of an adjacent building, accompanied by a small tree and an information stand in the foreground.

Throughout the following frames, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly to the right relative to the first-frame viewpoint, making foreground objects appear larger. The person in the green vest remains largely static on the left. Meanwhile, the sunlight and shadows across the scene gradually intensify and move, especially on the right-side building and within the passage, highlighting the "LUFT COFFEE" sign more prominently.

The first frame shows a paved outdoor passage between two modern buildings, viewed from a slight fisheye perspective. To the left, a tall building with reflective glass windows rises, adjacent to a light-colored construction barrier in the foreground. On this barrier, a white board displaying numerous small images and text is affixed. A man in a lime green vest and dark pants stands facing this board, slightly left of the viewer's center. To the right, a "LUFT COFFEE" shop with large glass panels and a white signage box is visible. Inside the coffee shop, tables and chairs are arranged, with at least one person seated. The building on the right has a textured reddish-brown facade and an ornate wall lamp. The paved passage extends forward into the distance, narrowing between the buildings, with several pedestrians walking away from the viewer further down the path.

The viewpoint progresses forward into the central passage. The man in the green vest, initially to the left of the first-frame viewpoint, is gradually passed by the advancing camera, receding further behind and to the left of the initial viewpoint. The construction barrier on the left and the "LUFT COFFEE" shop on the right recede from the foreground, revealing more of the passage walls further ahead from the first-frame viewpoint. The pedestrians previously seen in the central passage continue to move further away from the first-frame viewpoint, becoming smaller. Subtle shifts in sunlight and shadows occur across the right-hand building's facade.

In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a paved walkway within a narrow passage flanked by buildings. To the viewer's immediate left, a light-colored wall extends into the distance, with a dark brick building featuring windows and wall-mounted lights visible above it. To the right, an orange-brown building features glass folding doors revealing an interior with people seated at tables, and a menu board stands near the doors. Overhead, a brick structure connects the two buildings in the midground, and further down the narrowing walkway, a solitary person walks away from the viewer under a distant glass roof structure.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly advances forward along the walkway. The person initially seen in the far distance continues walking further away from the first-frame viewpoint, progressively diminishing in size until they are almost out of sight. The light and shadow patterns on the walkway and walls also show slight shifts, indicating a gradual change in perspective.
