frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame depicts a multi-track railway scene under a concrete overpass to the upper left, with a graffitied "cargo" train stationary on the leftmost track, positioned to the viewer's left. Multiple tracks curve into the distance, flanked by a grassy area and trees on the right, and distant buildings under a blue sky to the left.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the overpass and cargo train on the left recede and eventually move out of frame to the viewer's left. Concurrently, a utility pole positioned to the right of the tracks approaches and subsequently exits the frame to the right, as the ground and tracks pass beneath the viewer, revealing more of the distant railway infrastructure.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a sunny train yard with multiple tracks converging into the distance. A graffiti-covered "Cargo" train carriage occupies the lower left, moving away from the viewer, with a building visible behind it. Overhead, numerous electrical wires and poles crisscross a bright blue sky dotted with white clouds. To the right, a paved path transitions into a grassy area with trees in the mid-ground and background.
end of description
The train carriage on the viewer's left steadily recedes further away from its initial position. As the viewpoint advances, the tracks directly ahead and to the right gradually shift leftward within the frame, revealing more distant tracks and structures. The landscape and buildings in the background slowly recede as the scene progresses. From the fourth frame, a "Vmax: 40 km/h" overlay appears in the lower right foreground, indicating the viewer's speed.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a wide view of multiple parallel train tracks receding into the distance, with a gravel bed between them. To the viewer's immediate right, a paved platform runs alongside the tracks, bordered by a grassy bank and trees beyond, with a concrete wall near the tracks. On the far left, a multi-story building with a clock face is prominent, situated behind another paved area and a red train car. Numerous overhead power lines and support poles span across the scene above the tracks, while a small tunnel entrance is visible in the distant right. The sky overhead is bright blue with scattered white clouds, and faint hills mark the horizon.

end of description
Subsequent frames reveal a subtle dynamic change where the shadows cast by objects, such as the overhead lines, poles, and the building on the left, gradually shift and shorten across the scene. This indicates a progression of time or movement of the sun, altering the illumination of the tracks, platforms, and surrounding landscape relative to their initial positions. No new objects or scenes are revealed, maintaining the same spatial composition.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a railway scene under a blue sky with scattered white clouds, featuring multiple sets of tracks converging into the distance. To the far left, a multi-story building is visible behind a concrete structure and grassy area, while a concrete platform and trees line the right, all spanned by overhead power lines, with a red train on a curved track in the distant right.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the foreground gravel and the concrete platform on the right recede rapidly and exit the frame to the right, revealing more of the grassy embankment. The utility pole initially on the right also moves out of view to the right, while the distant red train in the right mid-ground appears larger as the viewer approaches it.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a train yard under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds. In the foreground, numerous train tracks with gravel ballast extend into the distance, with the central two tracks curving gently to the right. To the immediate left, a large utility pole stands, supporting extensive overhead catenary wires that span across the top of the frame, while further back on the left, industrial buildings and a grassy area are visible. On the right, a concrete barrier with a metal railing runs alongside the tracks, backed by dense green bushes and a tall reflective structure partially visible on the far right. In the far distance, a red train is visible on the tracks curving to the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the tracks. The prominent utility pole on the left and the reflective structure on the far right recede from the foreground and move out of view laterally. Objects in the middle ground, such as the concrete barrier, bushes on the right, and industrial buildings on the left, appear to draw closer. Yellow trackside markers emerge on the left and right sides of the tracks, becoming visible as the forward motion continues. The red train in the distance remains generally in place as the viewer approaches its location on the curve.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, multiple train tracks converge towards the horizon, with the main track extending straight ahead and others branching to the left and right, all laid on gravel. Overhead, a dense network of catenary wires supported by numerous poles spans across the blue sky, dotted with white clouds. To the left, a light-colored building with parked cars is visible in the mid-ground, backed by trees, while a red train is parked on tracks to the right, also in the mid-ground.
end of description
The viewpoint moves forward along the central track. As the camera advances, the building and cars on the left appear to recede and shift further left relative to the viewer's path. Similarly, the red train on the right also recedes and shifts further right, revealing more of the track area around it, including a black buffer stop emerging further down the track to the right. The overhead infrastructure appears to move past and overhead, maintaining its relative position to the viewer's movement.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents multiple train tracks extending into the distance under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. To the left, a large concrete building stands, while to the right, a red and blue train locomotive is parked on adjacent tracks. Overhead, a complex network of power lines and support structures spans across the scene, with a smaller orange train visible in the far distance slightly left of center.
end of description
As the viewer progresses forward, the red and blue locomotive on the right slowly recedes, revealing the "cgo" logo which then fully displays "cargo SBB CFF FFS" on its blue side. Simultaneously, all other fixed elements, including the distant orange train that appears to approach and the background infrastructure, shift backward relative to the viewer's forward movement.
