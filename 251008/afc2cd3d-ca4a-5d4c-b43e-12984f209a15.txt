The first frame displays a rainy city street at night, with wet pavement reflecting colorful lights from illuminated shopfronts lining both sides of the road. A person holding an umbrella walks away from the viewer on the right sidewalk, near a white planter box, while another person with an umbrella is visible further down the left sidewalk. Streetlights, a utility pole, and traffic lights are present in the midground, with faint car headlights visible in the distance.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the person on the right sidewalk continues walking further away from the viewer into the distance. Simultaneously, the person on the left sidewalk also progresses deeper into the scene. The rainy conditions and vibrant reflections on the wet surfaces remain consistent across all frames.

The first frame depicts a wet urban street at night, with a dark overcast sky. Immediately in front of the viewer, the glistening asphalt street occupies the left half, reflecting colorful lights from buildings and traffic signals further ahead. On the right, a wet tiled sidewalk extends into the distance, where a person holding a black umbrella walks away from the viewer. Buildings with illuminated storefronts and green trees line the street on the left, while similar buildings and utility poles are visible along the right side of the sidewalk. Distant vehicle headlights and traffic lights are discernible down the street.

In subsequent frames, the person holding the black umbrella on the right sidewalk consistently moves further away from the viewer, receding deeper into the mid-distance. Their position progresses along the sidewalk, appearing slightly smaller with each frame as they continue their walk away from the initial viewpoint. The reflections on the wet street and sidewalk also subtly shift and shimmer, but no new objects or scenes are revealed.
