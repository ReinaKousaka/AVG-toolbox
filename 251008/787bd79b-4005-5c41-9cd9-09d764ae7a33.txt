The first frame depicts a street scene in a village nestled among mountains under a clear blue sky. To the immediate right, a portion of a building with a dark roof and two white vans parked parallel to the viewer are visible. On the left, a paved road with white markings extends into the midground, bordered by a concrete barrier and a lush hedge with reddish-brown autumn leaves, behind which a white house with a dark roof stands. In the midground, several other buildings, including multi-story residences and a modern structure, are interspersed among trees with autumnal colors, all set against a backdrop of imposing, rugged mountains in the distance.

The scene dynamically changes as the viewpoint progresses forward along the street. The two white vans on the right recede and exit the frame, revealing more of the adjacent building to the right. Concurrently, a street lamp becomes more prominent on the mid-left, and a white SUV appears parked further along the street on the right, replacing the earlier vans. The autumn-colored hedge on the left also gradually recedes into the distance relative to the viewer's forward movement.
