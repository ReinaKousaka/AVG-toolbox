The first frame presents a narrow city street, with cobblestone sidewalks and a central asphalt path leading towards a bright sky; multi-story buildings line both sides, a shop window is on the left, and a man walks away from the viewer on the right. end of description. As the frames progress, the camera slowly moves forward down the street. The man on the right continues walking further away, while a woman, initially positioned further down the left sidewalk from the first-frame viewpoint, walks towards the viewer, gradually revealing the "NICOLAS" sign on the shop more clearly.
