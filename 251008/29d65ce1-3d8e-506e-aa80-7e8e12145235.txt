In the first frame, a paved road curves left in the midground, with a dark car moving away from the viewer. To the right, a stone wall in the foreground partially obscures a white building with dark balconies, backed by a tree-covered hill dotted with houses. On the left, a street light and metal barrier line the road, leading to more houses nestled among trees.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the dark car recedes, and yellow pedestrian crossing stripes become fully visible on the road ahead. The stone wall on the right gradually moves out of frame, revealing more of the white building and a grassy slope with a fence behind the initial wall. A black car parked on this newly revealed grassy area to the right appears in the later frames.

In the first frame, a road with yellow crosswalk stripes extends directly in front of the viewer, flanked by a white solid line on the left and a dashed line on the right. To the far right, a black car is parked behind a wire fence and stone wall. Further down the road in the center, another dark car is visible, while a blue street sign, black lamppost, and tall conifer tree stand on the left. Various houses are scattered across the left and right hillsides, with a lush green, tree-covered hill forming the background, under a pale blue sky with distant mountains to the far left.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the road and yellow crosswalk stripes recede towards the bottom and sides of the frame. The parked black car, wire fence, and stone wall on the far right shift out of view behind the viewer. Simultaneously, the blue street sign, lamppost, and conifer tree on the left move leftwards, eventually passing behind the viewer's original position. The distant dark car on the road approaches and then recedes to the left, as the viewpoint passes the intersection. The scene opens up to reveal more of the road ahead with new dashed lines and manholes now directly in front of the viewer.

In the first frame, a road junction extends from the viewer into the mid-ground, featuring white dashed lines and triangular markings on its surface. To the immediate left stands a tall black lamppost, with a guardrail and distant mountains visible beyond it. Further left, a large pine tree partially obscures a building, and a white car is parked behind the guardrail. In the center, a black car is driving away from the viewer. To the right, a stone retaining wall supports a grassy slope with several brown and white directional signs; above this, two multi-story buildings with balconies are nestled into a green hillside. The background features more distant green hills under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward and slightly right along the road. The road markings shift, and the black car recedes further into the distance. The buildings and the hillside on the right side of the view become progressively closer, revealing more architectural detail. Concurrently, the cluster of directional signs on the right becomes clearer and more signs are revealed, appearing to the right of their initial positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a paved road extends from the viewer into the midground, curving gently to the right. To the left, a metal guardrail runs alongside the road, and a large evergreen tree stands prominently, partially obscuring a building with a brown roof. Further left in the background, a distant mountain range is visible under a cloudy sky. To the right of the road, a stone retaining wall supports a grassy slope adorned with bushes and white directional signs. Behind this wall, a cream-colored building with brown balconies and a matching roof occupies the midground, with another building further down the street.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the road, causing the large evergreen tree on the left and the white directional signs on the right to recede and gradually move out of the frame. As the viewpoint advances, a dark-colored car becomes visible to the left, parked in front of the building previously partially obscured by the tree. The architecture of the left-side buildings, including their lower levels and details, becomes more apparent as the scene unfolds. The road continues to curve right, revealing more of the path ahead and the dynamic landscape.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a paved road ascending uphill, bordered by buildings under a partly cloudy sky. On the left, a traditional building with a red-tiled roof is seen behind a white SUV and a darker SUV, with a person standing near the white vehicle's rear. On the right, a multi-story building with balconies is situated behind a stone retaining wall topped with grass and a round shrub.
end of description
As the viewpoint subtly moves forward along the road, the person on the left becomes more fully visible, first interacting with the white SUV's rear, then opening and engaging with the darker SUV's trunk. The street and buildings on both sides gradually shift closer, maintaining their relative positions as the scene progresses uphill.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a paved road extends centrally uphill into the distance. To the immediate left, a dark brown building, labeled "Cafe Guflina Konditorei Dorf BÃ¤ckerei," stands with a black SUV and a dark grey SUV parked in front of it. Further down the street on the left, a lighter-colored building is partially visible. On the right, a stone retaining wall borders the road, leading up to a larger, light grey building with "BGZ" near its entrance, situated higher than the road. Green trees cover a hillside in the background, beneath a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the objects in the initial scene recede. The Cafe Guflina building and parked cars on the left move further left and eventually out of frame, revealing white outdoor chairs and a red planter box that were initially further ahead and to the left of the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the BGZ building and stone wall on the right recede, allowing more of the uphill road ahead to become visible.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a paved road extending uphill under a clear sky, bordered left by a parking area containing two dark cars and a pink building, with two white chairs visible on the far left. To the right, a large grey building stands behind a stone retaining wall and a fence.

end of description

As the viewpoint moves forward, the white chairs on the left recede from view while a dark SUV becomes fully visible, parked closer to the viewer. The surrounding buildings and the right-hand retaining wall expand as they are approached, revealing more of their lower details.
