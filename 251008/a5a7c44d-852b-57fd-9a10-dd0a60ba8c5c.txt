The first frame presents a dirt path winding into a dense evergreen forest, flanked by tall tree trunks with green canopies reaching towards the bright sky. Lush ferns and undergrowth densely cover the ground and a sloping bank to the right of the path.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the path, revealing more of the forest directly ahead of the first-frame viewpoint as the trees and undergrowth flanking the path scroll past. New sections of the path and additional distant trees become visible further down the trail, with a prominent rock emerging on the left side of the path, previously located further along the trail from the initial viewpoint.
