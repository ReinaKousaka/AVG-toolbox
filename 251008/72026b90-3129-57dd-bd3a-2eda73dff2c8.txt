The first frame shows the viewer standing in a narrow alleyway with a textured grey wall to the left and a vibrant yellow storefront to the right, adorned with a striped awning, numerous products on display, and a red lantern hanging above. In the mid-ground, two people walk away from the viewer, heading further down the alley where more distant storefronts and red lanterns are visible.

As the camera slowly advances forward along the alley, the two people ahead walk further into the distance. The yellow storefront to the right reveals slightly more of its interior display, while the ground patterns initially in the foreground move out of frame, revealing more of the alley stretching ahead of the viewer.

The first frame shows a narrow alleyway with a storefront on the viewer's right displaying packaged goods behind glass, and a weathered wall with a closed metal gate on the left. Three people walk away from the viewer down the center of the alley, towards red lanterns and other distant figures further ahead.

As the viewpoint moves forward into the alley, the people ahead recede, and the storefront on the right gradually reveals a closed metallic shutter further down the path. Simultaneously, the initial metal gate on the left moves out of view, revealing more of the weathered wall with shuttered windows and new red and green lanterns appearing further ahead along the left side of the alley.

The first frame shows a narrow, bustling alleyway. In the immediate foreground, facing away from the viewer, a man in a blue t-shirt and jeans with a grey sling bag walks slightly to the right of a woman in a white top, blue jeans, and a beige backpack. The alley floor is light-colored pavement with grates. To the far right, a yellow and black striped column is partially visible, while to the far left, a muted brown building wall stands. Further down the alley, on the left, a white scooter is parked near a shop entrance adorned with red and green lanterns hanging overhead. On the right, closed metal roller shutters line the buildings, with a black sign displaying "189" and Chinese characters affixed to the wall. More pedestrians and an orange striped awning are visible deeper into the narrow street, leading towards a brighter background.

The camera smoothly moves forward into the alley, following the man and woman as they progress further into the scene revealed in the first frame. As the viewpoint advances, the initial foreground objects pass to the sides, revealing more details of the shops on the left with various items and the continuing closed shutters on the right, along with more overhead lanterns and awnings further down the winding path.
