The first frame displays a paved path with a white dividing line extending into the distance, bordered by green grassy areas and a row of tall, bare trees on both sides, all under a clear blue sky. A large, light-barked tree trunk is prominently featured in the foreground right, while a black public bin sits to the left of the path, and three people walk away from the viewer in the mid-distance.
end of description.
The camera slowly moves forward along the path. The large tree trunk initially on the immediate right gradually recedes and moves out of view to the right, as does the public bin which eventually moves out of frame to the left. As the viewpoint advances, the three people ahead on the path become closer, and previously more distant sections of the path and the surrounding park's trees and evergreen foliage become more prominent within the frame.
