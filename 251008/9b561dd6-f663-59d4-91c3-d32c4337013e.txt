In the first frame, a man in a blue shirt walks away from the viewer on a sidewalk lined with bollards on the left side, adjacent to a red bike lane. Further left and closer to the viewer, another man in a bright yellow-green shirt walks towards the viewer. A dark gray pole with a 'GUN FREE ZONE' sign stands between the sidewalk and bike lane in the mid-ground. Across the red bike lane, a street features several vehicles, including two 'FUJI' buses, with a prominent red brick building and numerous city skyscrapers rising in the mid-to-background on the right and stretching into the distance.

As the frames progress, the man in the blue shirt moves further into the mid-ground away from the viewer, while the man in the yellow-green shirt advances towards the foreground on the left sidewalk, revealing a blue bike rack with a bicycle to his immediate left. Simultaneously, the yellow 'FUJI' bus on the right side of the street drives forward, passing the red bus and receding slightly into the background, and more people become visible inside the building entrance on the far left.

The first frame shows a city street scene on a sunny day. In the foreground to the left, blue shared bicycles are parked on a sidewalk where a man in a neon yellow shirt walks towards the viewer's right. Further along the sidewalk, a man in a blue shirt walks away from the viewer, parallel to a row of silver bollards. To the far right, a grey pole with a "gun free zone" sign stands beside a red bike lane, beyond which a white bus with "FUJI" text is visible on the main road. Tall buildings line both sides of the street, with a mix of modern high-rises and older brick structures, under a clear blue sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the man in the neon yellow shirt continues walking towards the right in the foreground, while the man in the blue shirt proceeds further away from the viewer down the sidewalk. The white "FUJI" bus on the road in the midground remains largely stationary, and no new objects or scenes are revealed.

The first frame depicts a city sidewalk on the left with a partially visible person in a green shirt and a blue rental bike, alongside a man in a blue polo and beige shorts walking away from the viewer towards a building entrance beneath a white arch. To the right, a red-paved lane runs parallel to the sidewalk, separated by silver bollards, leading to a street with cars and a bus, all framed by tall city buildings and a large blue advertisement and digital screen on the left building.
end of description
Subsequently, the person in the green shirt moves out of the frame to the right, and the man in the blue polo continues walking further away down the sidewalk. Concurrently, the digital screen on the building changes its display from text to a "Harry Potter" advertisement, while the bus in the background on the street subtly shifts its position further away from the viewer.

A man in a blue shirt and beige shorts walks away from the viewer on a city sidewalk. To his right, a row of silver bollards lines a red-painted lane and street with distant traffic and tall buildings under a clear sky. To the viewer's left, a Citi Bike rack, a building entrance with a "Harry Potter" digital ad, and an arched white canopy are visible.
end of description
The viewer moves forward, causing the man to walk further ahead on the sidewalk. As the camera progresses, the Citi Bike rack exits the left side of the frame, and new silver bollards become visible closer to the viewer on the right. The city street and buildings ahead continue to recede in the distance.

The first frame displays a man in a blue shirt and khaki shorts walking away from the viewer on a gray sidewalk, slightly right of center. To his left, a building entrance with a "Harry Potter The Exhibition" sign is visible, while to his right, metallic bollards line a red bike lane and a street with vehicles and distant pedestrians. Tall city buildings rise on both sides, extending into the background.

end of description
As the camera moves forward, the man, exhibition entrance, and bollards progressively recede into the distance directly ahead and to the right of the viewer's path. The arched walkway and more pedestrians become prominent on the left and right sides before also receding, and a manhole cover is revealed within the red bike lane to the right.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a man in a blue polo shirt and light shorts walks away from the viewer on a city sidewalk, with a red bike lane and street to his right, bordered by cylindrical bollards and a metal barrier. To the viewer's left, a modern building displays "Harry Potter: The Exhibition" and "Midtown Bus Terminal" signs above a glass entrance, beyond which an arched white structure extends. end of description. As the frames progress, the man continues walking further away from the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, a person on a bright green bicycle, initially in the distance on the red bike lane to the right, moves steadily towards the viewer's position, passing through the mid-ground.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows an outdoor urban scene. In the foreground, a concrete sidewalk occupies the left, with a metal railing and several gray cylindrical bollards to the right, separating it from a red-paved lane. A man in a blue shirt and khaki shorts walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk, slightly left of center. To his left is a modern building entrance marked "Midtown Bus Terminal," and further down, an arched, covered walkway. In the midground and background, a street with vehicles and tall buildings lines both sides, with a cyclist riding on the red lane to the right.
end of description
The camera slowly moves forward, following the man who continues walking along the sidewalk into the distance, eventually passing under the arched walkway, which is initially ahead of him. Simultaneously, the cyclist on the red lane, initially to the right of the man, pedals further away into the background and eventually exits the frame to the right. Another person in white becomes visible emerging from under the arched walkway ahead of the man and walks further into the background. The street view to the right constantly updates with new bollards appearing in the foreground as the camera advances, maintaining the red lane to the right.
