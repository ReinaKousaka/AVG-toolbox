The first frame presents a lively waterside promenade at dusk, viewed from an eye-level perspective. To the right, a brick-paved walkway extends into the distance, populated by several people walking away from the viewer, and featuring a small tree in a circular planter alongside a large red umbrella. Parallel to the walkway on the left, a narrow canal with a black metal railing reflects the blue-lit water, beyond which stands a row of multi-story buildings with arched windows, illuminated storefronts, and outdoor seating areas under numerous small red umbrellas. In the far background, taller residential buildings rise, with the sky displaying a soft twilight glow.

Throughout the following frames, the most noticeable dynamic change is the canal's illumination, which gradually shifts from blue to green along its length, creating an undulating pattern of colored light reflected in the water. Individuals on the brick-paved walkway continue moving further away from the viewer. No new objects or scenes are revealed, as the camera maintains its initial static viewpoint of the promenade.
