The first frame depicts a busy city street featuring the hood of a white car in the bottom-left and the front section of a modern yellow and white tram on the far right. Further down the street, an older yellow tram is stationary on tracks mid-left, adjacent to orange construction barriers, with a large mural on a distant building behind it. Buildings with arched windows line the right side of the street, where pedestrians are visible.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the modern yellow and white tram on the right moves forward, away from the viewer's immediate right, progressively revealing its side, including "ATM" and the number "7626" printed on it. All other objects, including the white car, old yellow tram, buildings, and construction fencing, remain stationary relative to their first-frame positions.

The first frame displays a bustling street scene with a white car partially visible in the bottom left foreground. A modern yellow and black tram occupies the right side, running parallel to the viewer, while an older, classic yellow tram is further down the street to the left. Orange construction netting with a circular sign is positioned to the left of the older tram, and multi-story buildings with detailed architecture line both sides of the street, with a large, distant building featuring a mural.

In the subsequent frames, the modern yellow and black tram on the right begins to move forward, revealing a "Negramaro" advertisement on its side. The older yellow tram on the left, the foreground car, and the background buildings remain stationary relative to the viewer's fixed perspective.

In the first frame, the top of a silver car is visible in the bottom left foreground. To its right, a modern yellow and black tram occupies the middle ground, moving away from the viewer and partially obscuring an older, all-yellow tram to its left. Both trams are on tracks extending into the distance, beneath overhead power lines. Tall urban buildings line the street in the background, with a building on the left featuring a large mural and a dome further behind it, while orange construction barriers are visible on the far left.

The modern yellow and black tram on the right progressively moves forward and away from the viewer. As it advances, a "negramaro" advertisement on its side is replaced by a banner for "ALESSANDRO CATTELLAN" with event dates. Further movement reveals the "Sirietto" model name, the tram number "7626," and an ATM logo towards its rear. The older yellow tram on the left and the car in the foreground remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
