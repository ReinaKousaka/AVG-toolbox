The first frame displays a rainy city street at night, seen from beneath a dark umbrella partially covering the top edge. In the foreground, a grey SUV is parked on the left, while a red scooter and a purple electric scooter are parked curbside in the bottom center. A dark SUV is parked further down the street behind the scooters, followed by a row of trees lining the right side of the wet road. On the far right, a brightly lit storefront is visible. Across the street, buildings adorned with colorful neon signs (pink, green, blue) illuminate the hazy background, alongside streetlights and the headlights and taillights of distant traffic.

Throughout the frames, the umbrella subtly shifts at the top. A white delivery van dynamically enters the scene from the mid-left, driving across the street towards the right, passing behind the dark parked SUV and between the foreground trees. Concurrently, a yellow taxi emerges in the far background on the left and moves progressively towards the right, eventually exiting the frame.
