An aerial view presents a narrow paved road, bordered by dense green forest, extending from the bottom-left toward the top-center of the frame. A parallel line of white utility poles with wires runs along the right side of the road, also receding into the distance above the green canopy.
end of description
The viewpoint gradually pulls back and zooms out, revealing more of the vast green forest that was previously beyond the frame. As the camera ascends, the road and utility poles appear longer, stretching further into the distance. Eventually, a clear blue body of water, likely an ocean, emerges on the far right horizon, previously hidden behind the dense tree line. The expanding landscape reveals a seemingly endless expanse of verdant land meeting the sea.
