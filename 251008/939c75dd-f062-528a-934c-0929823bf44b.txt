The first frame displays a rainy night cityscape. In the immediate foreground-left, the front portion of a dark car rests next to a wet crosswalk marked with white stripes. A prominent utility pole stands in the mid-right foreground, featuring various signs, while a paved sidewalk extends behind it, populated by individuals holding umbrellas near a white tent and another parked black car on the far right. A wide, wet street stretches into the distance, bordered by trees, streetlights, and buildings, with a red traffic light visible in the mid-ground.

Subsequently, the black car in the foreground moves forward and to the viewer's right, gradually exiting the left side of the frame. The distant traffic light on the right side of the street changes from red to green. People under umbrellas on the sidewalk also exhibit slight movements, shifting their positions near the white tent.

In the first frame, a wet, dark city street at night is visible, with rain actively falling. A prominent dark pole stands in the left foreground, slightly obscuring the pedestrian crosswalk (zebra crossing) to its right. Beyond the crosswalk, the street extends into the distance, reflecting various colored lights from streetlights and traffic signals, which appear red further down the right side of the street. On the right-hand sidewalk, benches are placed under a white canopy, with a dark vehicle partially visible on the far right. Buildings with illuminated signs line the far left, and more buildings and trees are visible in the background along the street.

As the video progresses, the camera subtly pans to the right. This causes the prominent dark pole in the foreground to gradually shift further left, partially exiting the frame. Consequently, more of the pedestrian crosswalk and the wet street beyond it, formerly partially obscured by the pole, become visible directly ahead of the first-frame viewpoint. The benches and canopy on the right sidewalk also shift slightly left relative to the frame, revealing a bit more of the street scene further to the right.

The first frame depicts a rainy city night scene with a tree trunk adorned with a red ribbon centrally located in the foreground. To the left, a wet, striped crosswalk stretches across the road, which reflects numerous streetlights and distant building lights extending into the background. On the right sidewalk, a traffic light showing red is visible, alongside a white canopy structure over a small stand. end of description
Subsequently, a yellow delivery scooter enters from the midground left and traverses the road towards the right of the frame. A blue van then appears further down the street, also moving rightward relative to the initial viewpoint. The heavy rain visibly continues to fall throughout the sequence, creating splashes on the wet surfaces.
