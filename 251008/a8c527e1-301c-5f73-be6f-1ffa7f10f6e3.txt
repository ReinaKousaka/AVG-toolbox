To the viewer's immediate right, a tall yellow banner with drinks and food is partially visible, positioned in front of a black car. On the far left, a motorcycle, a blue scooter, and orange cones stand near a tree beside a wet road reflecting car lights. Two individuals, one with a red and another with a white umbrella, walk away from the viewer on the midground sidewalk, past a parked black car and receding illuminated shops and streetlights.

The people with umbrellas continue walking further away from the viewer into the distance on the sidewalk. Simultaneously, the banner to the viewer's immediate right gradually moves out of the frame, revealing more of the black car that was previously behind it. The motorcycle on the far left also moves further away from the viewer, down the road.

To the viewer's immediate right, the rear of a dark car is partially visible, while on the left, an orange traffic cone, two more orange barriers, and a blue scooter are positioned along the curb near a tree trunk. Two individuals holding umbrellas walk away from the viewer on the sidewalk, with brightly lit buildings lining the street in the distant background.

The two individuals with umbrellas continuously walk further away from the viewer along the wet sidewalk. Simultaneously, a person on a motorcycle wearing a bright jacket emerges from the far left street and travels away from the viewer, gradually receding into the distance. The black car on the right and the objects on the left curb remain stationary throughout the sequence.
