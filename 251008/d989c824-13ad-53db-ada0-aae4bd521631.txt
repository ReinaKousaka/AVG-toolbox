The first frame displays a nocturnal street scene with a wet asphalt road reflecting numerous bright lights in the foreground, creating streaks of white, red, and turquoise. Across the road, a sidewalk features several illuminated bus shelters, each with bright white displays, where people are standing; one person on the far left holds a yellow umbrella. In the midground and background, a large multi-story building with distinctive horizontal bands of dark and lighter grey dominates the right, while other buildings with illuminated signs are visible further left, all under a dark sky punctuated by distant streetlights.

Over the subsequent frames, the individual holding the yellow umbrella on the far left side of the sidewalk gradually moves towards the viewer's left edge of the frame, eventually exiting the scene. Other figures standing near the bus shelters also exhibit subtle shifts in their positions. The vibrant reflections on the wet road continuously shimmer and slightly alter as ambient lights or potential light sources (like unseen vehicles) move across the scene, though no new objects or major scene changes are revealed.
