A wet urban sidewalk stretches into the distance, flanked by lush green trees on the left and a modern building facade with a curved glass display on the right foreground, showing mobile phones. A green bus is parked to the far left, partially obscured by a black kiosk next to a bicycle, while tall city buildings rise in the background under an overcast sky.

The green bus on the far left, behind the kiosk, gradually drives away and exits the frame to the left. Simultaneously, a person holding a dark umbrella and wearing a light coat appears on the sidewalk in the midground, walking away from the viewer. The view slightly shifts, revealing more of the building's curved facade and a shop entrance on the right.

The first frame captures a rainy city street with a dark, shuttered kiosk in the left foreground and a prominent silver light pole in the right midground, bordering a wet, curving path. A person holding a black umbrella walks away from the viewer in the midground center, past a partially visible green bus on the far left and tall modern buildings with vibrant signs on the right.

The person with the black umbrella then turns and walks towards the viewer, exiting the frame to the immediate left, while a new masked person carrying a silver bag enters from the midground left, also walking towards and then past the viewer. Concurrently, the green bus moves further left and out of sight, and the person with the pink umbrella continues walking away from the viewer further down the path.

The first frame shows a wet city sidewalk, littered with scattered yellow leaves, stretching into the distance. To the immediate left, a concrete planter is partially visible, behind which a green bus is parked at a stop with a green street sign above it. A person holding a bright pink umbrella is walking away from the viewer on this left sidewalk. To the right, the sidewalk curves around a small park area featuring a bronze statue of a figure on horseback, with towering modern buildings forming the background.
end of description
The person with the pink umbrella, initially in the midground-left, progressively walks towards and past the viewer. As she approaches, her facial mask and a black shoulder bag become visible. She then moves into the left foreground, with her umbrella briefly dominating the far left of the frame, before she completely exits the scene to the left, leaving the street and buildings fully revealed behind her.
