The first frame presents a narrow, cobblestone street, with a stone-faced building and outdoor cafe seating to the viewer's left, and another cafe with umbrellas and patrons (including a baby stroller) to the right. A small child in blue walks in the mid-ground, centrally, while historic buildings line the street ahead, receding into the background.

As the camera moves forward along the street, objects on both the left and right sides recede from the viewer's immediate foreground. The child in blue continues walking further away and slightly to the right of their initial central position. The group with the baby stroller on the right becomes momentarily more prominent before also moving further into the distance as the scene progresses forward.

A cobbled street scene features a stone building with an arched entrance and two seated patrons on the left. To the right, an old red-brick building with multiple shopfronts lines the street, while a lighter-colored building with green shutters is visible further back on the left. Several pedestrians walk away from the viewer down the street, notably a man in a green shirt and blue shorts in the mid-ground.

As the viewpoint subtly pans left and shifts forward, the two seated patrons on the left slowly recede and eventually move out of frame to the extreme left. The man in green shorts continues walking further away and slightly to the right, while a new person walking with a black and white dog emerges into the mid-ground center, moving away from the viewer. The left building's facade becomes more visible, revealing "Banca CR Firenze" signage previously partially obscured by the cafe, as the rightmost red-brick building gradually disappears from the frame's right edge.
