A bronze statue of a man sits at a small table with an open book, positioned in the right foreground, while a blue slatted trash can stands in the left foreground, beside a tree wrapped with festive lights. Behind these, a sidewalk runs parallel to a street stretching into the distance, flanked on the right by a brick building with large windows and an entrance featuring double doors under a "FIRST OF THE GUNS" sign. On the left, across the street, older buildings and a white car are visible, with bare trees and hills lining the distant horizon under a pale sky.
end of description
The viewpoint moves steadily forward and slightly to the left. The bronze statue, initially in the right foreground, shifts further right and eventually exits the frame. Concurrently, the blue trash can and the lit tree, starting in the left foreground, move leftward and also exit the frame. This continuous movement reveals more of the sidewalk and the brick building on the right, and the street and buildings extending away from the original viewpoint.
