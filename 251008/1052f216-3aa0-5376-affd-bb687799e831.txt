The first frame presents a pedestrian street with numerous people walking away along a paved path, flanked on the left by a grassy area with trees and more people sitting, and on the right by storefronts and a street with parked vehicles. In the background, tall modern buildings rise under a clear sky, ahead of the viewer.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the path. People initially in the immediate foreground move out of view to the viewer's left, revealing more of the grassy area and a white banner previously partially obscured on the left. A woman in a pink dress and mask enters the left foreground, walking ahead, while the central crowd continues to advance further into the distance.

The first frame depicts a bustling urban street scene from a ground-level perspective. In the immediate foreground and midground, a diverse group of pedestrians walks away from the viewer on a paved sidewalk, including a person holding a white balloon and another in a light green shirt and straw hat. To the left, a low stone planter wall runs alongside a grassy park area with scattered trees and additional people sitting or strolling in the mid-distance, behind which a large white banner with red text is visible. To the right, a narrow road parallels the sidewalk, flanked by multi-story buildings housing various shops and businesses, including "DALKOMM COFFEE," with taller skyscrapers like "LOTTETOWER" and "CGV" dominating the background under a clear sky.

As the frames progress, the pedestrians in the midground continue to move forward, receding further from the viewer's initial position. A new woman in a pink cardigan and a face mask, holding a phone, becomes increasingly prominent as she walks forward on the right side of the frame, having emerged from behind the initial crowd. Simultaneously, a white car appears on the street to the right of the main walking group, moving in the same forward direction. The scene subtly shifts, gradually revealing more of the street ahead and the shopfronts on the right.
