A wet city street is visible under overcast skies with rain. In the foreground to the right, a brick sidewalk borders the road, with three trees and two utility poles. The midground shows a multi-lane asphalt road with white markings and a crosswalk; a black car drives left, while a pedestrian with an umbrella walks on the far left sidewalk. In the background on the left, a multi-story building features storefronts, including Starbucks Coffee, and various signs with Korean text.

The initial black car continues driving left across the midground, its brake lights briefly illuminating before it nearly exits the scene. Subsequently, a large dark SUV enters the frame from the right, moving left along the midground street. Its brake lights activate as it proceeds, passing the foreground trees. The first black car is then seen turning left further down the street in the background. Finally, the SUV exits the frame to the left, with its brake lights turning off.

The first frame depicts a wet city street corner during rain, viewed from a sidewalk on the right, featuring a utility pole and tree trunks in the foreground. A crosswalk spans the wet asphalt road to the left, where a dark SUV with illuminated brake lights is visible in the midground, partially behind a tree, across from a multi-story building housing a Starbucks.

The SUV subsequently begins to drive forward, turning right and gradually exiting the frame to the right, as the traffic light on the right side of the street transitions from red to green. Subtle movements are also observed among pedestrians on the far left sidewalk in front of the building.

The first frame displays a rainy city street with a prominent dark pole and a tree on the immediate right, next to a wet sidewalk. A wet asphalt road with a crosswalk and a white arrow pointing away from the viewer occupies the midground, leading to a multi-story building with a Starbucks on its corner at the far left, where pedestrians with umbrellas are visible. Further in the midground, an intersection with traffic lights (green for straight ahead, red for the right turn) and additional city buildings line the street.

A dark sedan then appears from the immediate left of the first-frame viewpoint, driving rightward across the crosswalk. The car continues through the intersection, moving further to the right relative to the initial viewpoint, until it eventually exits the frame on the far right.
