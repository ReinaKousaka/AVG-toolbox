The first frame depicts a young couple walking hand-in-hand down the center of a covered street arcade, flanked by a graffiti-covered metal-shuttered wall on the right and a street with parked cars and arched buildings to the left, as the arcade recedes into the background with more arches and shops.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the couple steadily advances closer to the viewer, their forms growing larger within the fixed viewpoint of the arcade. The woman momentarily raises her hand in frames 5 and 6, but no new objects or scenes become visible.

In the first frame, two young people walk toward the viewer under a covered walkway, with the man slightly ahead and to the left of the woman. A long series of arched porticos with columns recedes into the background on the left, revealing parked cars and distant buildings. To the right, a shopfront is secured by a closed, graffiti-marked metal roller shutter. A freestanding sign stands in the middle distance of the walkway.
end of description
The two individuals continue walking past the viewer, moving progressively to the left foreground and eventually exiting the frame from the left, revealing more of the portico and the parked cars beyond. All other objects, including the distant buildings, the parked vehicles, the shopfront with its closed shutter, and the standing sign, remain static and in their original positions relative to the initial viewpoint.

A long, covered arcade with a paved walkway extends into the distance, flanked by light-colored columns on the left and a shopfront with a recessed entrance on the right, next to a large metal gate at the far right. Parked cars, including a black Smart and a white Fiat, line the street beyond the left columns, while an "I love Polpini" A-frame sign stands on the walkway near a partially visible green-and-white banner.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly moves forward and slightly to the right, causing the initial parked cars on the left and the metal gate on the right to exit the frame. Simultaneously, more of the green-and-white "PALMA FACILE" banner and the shop entrance become visible closer to the viewer on the right, and a distant traffic light on the street to the left transitions to red.

The first frame shows a long, arched portico receding into the distance, with columns on the left and shopfronts on the right. In the foreground, a partial green and white flag is on the far right, and an "I ❤️ Proteins" A-frame sign stands centrally on the walkway. To the left of the portico, parked cars (including a black and a white one) and distant buildings are visible along a street.
end of description
The camera slowly pans to the right, causing the green and white flag to progressively move out of the frame and revealing more of the building facade and a light fixture to the right of the A-frame sign.

In the first frame, a black A-frame sign with "I ❤️ Proteins" and food images is prominent in the foreground to the right. To the left, a white car and a motorcycle are parked next to a large column, bordering a paved walkway under a long series of arches forming a portico. In the background to the left, a street with buildings, including one with a distant tower, and other parked cars is visible, while the portico stretches into the distance, revealing people and storefronts with graffiti on the right, and a bright green circular sign further ahead under the arches.
end of description
Across the following frames, the A-frame sign on the right side of the viewer's first-frame perspective gradually slides to the right. This continuous movement reveals more of the light-colored wall directly behind where the sign was initially positioned. By the last frame, only a small portion of the sign's left edge remains visible on the far right.

The first frame depicts a long, arched portico with a paved floor, receding into the distance. To the left, a motorcycle, parked cars, and street buildings are visible, while to the right stands a wall covered in graffiti, featuring a closed wooden door. A prominent circular green light is visible far down the portico, beneath the arches. end of description. Over the subsequent frames, the closed wooden door on the right wall gradually begins to open outwards. The door continues to open wider, progressively revealing a dark interior space behind it.
