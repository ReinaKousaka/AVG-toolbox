The first frame shows a nighttime city street with a sidewalk on the left foreground featuring a planter, reddish foliage, and a building's steps with a black railing. On the midground sidewalk, two people walk away from the viewer past three black trash bags, while the street on the right has parked cars and distant headlights, with a tree trunk in the immediate right foreground.

The camera steadily moves forward, revealing more of the sidewalk and street ahead from the initial viewpoint. The two individuals on the sidewalk continue walking away, gradually diminishing in size, while the cars parked on the right and building facades become clearer as the view progresses further down the street.

The first frame captures a nighttime street view, with dark metal railings and building facades lining the left side. In the right foreground, several black garbage bags rest on the sidewalk, next to a street with parked cars and an outdoor dining setup visible in the midground to the right. Two individuals walk away from the viewer on the sidewalk, positioned left of the street.
end of description
The two individuals continue walking further away from the viewer down the sidewalk. A red car drives away from the viewer, moving down the street to the right of the walking pair. As they proceed, more of the street, buildings on the left, and additional people in the outdoor dining area to the right become progressively visible further into the distance relative to the initial viewpoint.

In the first frame, the viewer is on a sidewalk at night, looking down a city street. To the left and in the foreground are two trash bins with black bags, and another black bag lies on the ground, next to stairs leading up to a building with a dark railing. Two people walk away from the viewer on the sidewalk, with another black trash bag between them and the viewer; a red car is parked on the street to their right, and further down, bright car headlights illuminate the road. The right side features outdoor dining structures with people, and buildings line both sides of the street under a bright street light.
end of description
As the frames progress, the two individuals on the sidewalk continue walking further away from the viewer, pulling the black trash bag with them. Simultaneously, the red car on the right is replaced by a dark SUV-like vehicle that slowly drives across the street, moving from right to left and away from the viewer's initial position.

In the first frame, the viewer is on a sidewalk at night, looking down a street. To the immediate left, a brick building with visible windows and an ornate iron railing extends towards the background. On the sidewalk in the mid-ground, two people walk away from the viewer, passing by several black trash bags and a street tree with overhead lights. To the right, a street with a crosswalk leads into the distance, lined with buildings and outdoor dining structures featuring white coverings, with distant car headlights visible.
end of description
As the frames progress, the two individuals on the sidewalk continue walking further away from the viewer. The camera subtly moves forward, causing the black trash bags on the sidewalk to appear closer and larger in the foreground. Concurrently, a vehicle with bright headlights approaches the viewer from the distant street, and another pedestrian is seen crossing the street from right to left in the mid-ground.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The initial frame captures a dimly lit city street at night, featuring a brick building and a black fence on the viewer's left, with a sidewalk where two people walk away under illuminated scaffolding. To the right, a street with a crosswalk shows a person moving left across it, a dark SUV with bright headlights facing the viewer, and a small tree with trash bags in the center foreground.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the two individuals on the sidewalk continue walking further away from the viewer, while the pedestrian crossing the street moves further to the left. Simultaneously, the dark SUV on the street begins to move forward, and a yellow taxi emerges from the right side of the street, behind the SUV, driving towards the viewer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a nighttime street scene. To the immediate left, several cylindrical trash cans are positioned in front of a reddish-brown brick building. Extending from the mid-left towards the center is a metal scaffolding structure, decorated with string lights, under which a young couple walks away from the viewer. On the right side of the sidewalk, black trash bags are piled at the base of a small tree. In the mid-ground, a white crosswalk spans the street, where a yellow taxi and another vehicle with bright headlights are approaching from the right.
end of description
The young couple walks further away from the viewer, continuing into the mid-ground under the scaffolding. A pedestrian on the right side of the crosswalk begins walking left across the street. The yellow taxi drives forward from the right, moving across the crosswalk and past the first pedestrian towards the left. A second pedestrian emerges from the far right, following the first across the street. The vehicle with bright headlights behind the taxi also advances. The camera subtly moves forward, making the foreground objects like the trash cans on the left appear to recede slightly.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a nighttime city street from a ground-level perspective. To the viewer's immediate left, two dark bins, one with a light lid, are partially visible in the foreground next to a low wooden barrier. A paved sidewalk extends into the mid-ground, bordered on the left by a building with arched windows and outdoor dining under scaffolding, where several people are seated and standing. On the right side of the sidewalk, scaffolding poles extend upwards, and a black trash bag rests on the ground in the foreground, next to a tree trunk. Beyond the sidewalk is a street with a crosswalk, showing cars with headlights and a pedestrian in the distance, with more buildings lining the far background.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewpoint gradually moves forward along the sidewalk. The bins and trash bag initially in the foreground move out of frame to the bottom left and right, respectively. Concurrently, more of the outdoor dining area and its patrons to the left become visible as the viewer approaches. The two individuals walking away on the sidewalk continue their movement, while a bicyclist emerges from the background and travels from right to left across the street. Vehicles and a pedestrian further down the street also continue their motion.
