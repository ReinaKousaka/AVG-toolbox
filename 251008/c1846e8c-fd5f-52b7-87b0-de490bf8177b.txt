The first frame captures a person on the far left looking at a phone, while a Mario cosplayer and a Luigi cosplayer (holding a phone to take a picture) are positioned mid-left and center facing the viewer. Further to the right, two other individuals walk away from the viewer, all within a convention hall featuring a large cloud-decorated wall on the background left.

As frames progress, the person on the far left exits the scene, and the Mario and Luigi cosplayers move past the viewer to the left, fully revealing the decorative wall and two previously obscured black stands. The two individuals on the right continue receding further into the depth of the convention hall from the initial viewpoint.
