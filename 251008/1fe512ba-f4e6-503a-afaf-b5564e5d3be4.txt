The viewer stands on a wet brick sidewalk that extends into the distance on the right, bordered by a black metal fence on the left. Behind the fence lies a rainy road where a silver car and white van are visible in the mid-distance, while to the right, a rocky embankment covered in dense foliage and large trees runs parallel to the sidewalk.

A large blue and white truck first appears on the road to the left, moving towards the viewer, gradually passing the first tree and exiting the frame. Subsequently, a white pickup truck, then a dark grey car, and finally a blue pickup truck consecutively emerge from the distance on the left, each moving towards and past the viewer's original position.

The viewer is positioned on a wet, brick-paved sidewalk extending towards the horizon on the right. To the left, a black metal fence runs parallel, separating the sidewalk from a wet asphalt road where a blurry blue vehicle moves away in the mid-ground and a lighter car is further ahead. A utility pole stands on the sidewalk near the left, and a dense line of green trees flanks both sides of the road and sidewalk, with a rocky, grassy bank on the far right.

After the initial frame, the blurry blue vehicle on the road continues to move away from the viewer on the left, eventually exiting the scene. A new white car then appears on the road from the mid-ground left, passing in front of the viewer's immediate left and then receding into the distance. All other elements, including the wet pavement, fence, and trees, remain stationary in their positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a wet, reddish-brown brick sidewalk extending from the foreground to the distance on the right, parallel to a black metal fence on its left. Beyond the fence, a dark asphalt road is visible to the left, also wet from rain, with a light pole in the far left foreground. A line of green trees runs along the sidewalk on the right, and another line borders the far side of the road to the left, with dense foliage receding into the hazy background on both sides.
end of description
The scene remains largely static for the initial frames, with a "main everyday" watermark appearing in the bottom left from frame 5. From frame 7, a blue car emerges on the wet asphalt road to the left of the black fence. It travels away from the viewer, moving horizontally across the mid-left portion of the frame, and continues further down the road into the distance.
