A street scene at dusk depicts a bus stop shelter with illuminated ads on the left, beside a street where a black car and a silver car drive away from the viewer. To the right, a restaurant with a yellow awning and decorated outdoor seating is visible, while multiple pedestrians walk further down the sidewalk away from the viewer. end of description. In subsequent frames, the cars and existing pedestrians continue to recede into the distance on the street and sidewalk, respectively. A new pedestrian enters the scene from the far right foreground, walking away from the viewer along the sidewalk, while the illuminated advertisements on the bus stop shelter dynamically change.

The first frame displays a city street at dusk, viewed from a slightly elevated perspective. To the immediate left is a bus stop shelter featuring a brightly illuminated advertisement. On the right, a person in a dark jacket walks away from the viewer, beside an outdoor restaurant seating area with yellow awnings and string lights. Further down the sidewalk in the midground, several other pedestrians are also walking away, while a black car drives along the street to the left. Buildings line both sides of the street, under a twilight sky showing hues of purple and blue. end of description.
In subsequent frames, the illuminated advertisement on the bus stop shelter dynamically changes its content. Simultaneously, the black car on the street and all visible pedestrians continue to move further away from the viewer.

The first frame presents a twilight street scene with an illuminated advertising display case prominent on the immediate left and a restaurant with a red awning and string lights on the immediate right. A sidewalk populated by pedestrians walking away extends into the midground, flanked by bare trees and a road with cars, beneath a sky subtly lit and adorned with red lanterns overhead.

end of description
As the camera steadily moves forward, the illuminated display case on the immediate left exits the frame. A dark trash bin, previously further ahead and to the left of the initial viewpoint, is revealed on the sidewalk. Simultaneously, more distant sections of the street, including additional buildings and overhead string lights, become progressively visible further along the path.

In the first frame, a city street scene at dusk is visible, with buildings lining both sides. On the left, a road features a black car moving away from the viewer, bordered by a sidewalk with a grey trash can in the foreground. Overhead, decorative string lights illuminate the street, while buildings with multiple windows stretch into the distance. On the right, a restaurant with a red awning and illuminated interior is prominent, with green planters in front. On the sidewalk in the middle, a group of pedestrians, including one in a white jacket and black mask on the far right, walk away from the viewer, with a bare-branched tree and a yellow streetlamp centrally positioned among them.
end of description
As the frames progress, the pedestrians continue to walk away from the viewer along the sidewalk, with the person in the white jacket and mask gradually moving off-frame to the viewer's right. Concurrently, a series of yellow construction barriers appears on the left sidewalk next to the trash can. Later, two pedestrians from the left of the original group move closer to the viewer, and one is now seen carrying yellow shopping bags.

The first frame captures a city street at dusk, with illuminated buildings stretching into the background on both sides. In the foreground left, a grey trash bin and yellow bollards are visible, while on the sidewalk, two women walk rightwards past a bare tree with a street lamp, opposite a restaurant featuring a red awning and menu boards on the right.
end of description
Subsequently, the two women in the immediate foreground move past the viewer, exiting the frame to the bottom-right. Meanwhile, other pedestrians on the sidewalk continue walking further down the street away from the viewer, while the buildings and street architecture remain static.

The first frame depicts a city street scene at dusk. In the immediate foreground, a tree trunk with a lit yellow streetlamp stands center-left, partially obscuring the sidewalk. To its left, a paved road with yellow markings and two bollards extends into the distance, lined by multi-story buildings adorned with festive string lights. On the right, a sidewalk hosts several pedestrians walking away, beside "Au Petit Duc," a restaurant with a red awning and a menu board visible in the mid-right.

end of description

From the initial viewpoint, the camera subtly moves forward and slightly pans right. The pedestrians on the sidewalk continue their movement; notably, a person in a black jacket and face mask, initially visible in the mid-right, walks towards the first-frame viewpoint and then passes out of the frame to the viewer's immediate right. Other individuals on the sidewalk also progress further along their paths, moving away from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a person in a black jacket and mask walks from the right foreground towards the left. A large tree trunk stands prominently in the left foreground, partially obscuring a light pole to its immediate left. To the right of the viewer, a cafe with a red awning and a black signboard is visible along the sidewalk, where a group of pedestrians walks away into the midground. A street with moving vehicles runs parallel to the sidewalk on the left, flanked by buildings with illuminated windows under a dusk sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the masked person in the right foreground moves further left and exits the frame. The group of pedestrians in the midground continues walking away from the viewer, appearing smaller as they recede. A new man in a dark jacket emerges from behind the tree in the left midground, walking forward towards the viewer. Additionally, the traffic light to the left of the street, previously green, changes to red, and decorative string lights become more prominent on distant buildings.
