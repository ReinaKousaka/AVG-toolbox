The first frame shows a paved road with a solid yellow line on the left and a white line on the right, covered in dappled shadows, extending forward. To the immediate left is a wooden guardrail running parallel to the road, with lush green trees visible beyond and slightly below it. On the right, a sidewalk with grass borders a stone wall, also lined with trees, and a small black utility box rests near the wall. In the distance, the road curves slightly right, and a yellow diamond-shaped sign is visible on the right side.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The guardrail on the left and the stone wall with its accompanying sidewalk and trees on the right gradually move from the background towards the viewer and then out of frame. The yellow diamond-shaped sign on the right also approaches and passes the viewer as the scene advances.
