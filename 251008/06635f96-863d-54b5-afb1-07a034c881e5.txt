To the viewer's right, a light green building features a glass storefront with a yellow umbrella and potted plants outside, alongside a utility pole with Korean signage. In the background, the street recedes with more buildings, a red traffic light, and distant pedestrians. end of description. A silver taxi enters the frame from the viewer's immediate left and slowly drives away from the viewer along the street.
