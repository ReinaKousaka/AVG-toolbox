In the first frame, the viewer is on a sidewalk beside a street on the left and an outdoor dining area on the right, under a clear blue sky. A tall blue information signpost stands in the lower-left foreground. To the left, a street with a green bike lane features a black car moving away from the viewer, with several tall city buildings visible in the mid-to-far background. To the right, a large grey building with arched windows and yellow awnings houses an outdoor dining area with tables, chairs, yellow umbrellas, and patrons, displaying 'MARKETBAR' and 'E BAR' signs. Directly ahead and in the background, a long pedestrian walkway leads towards a prominent clock tower building, with several people walking along it.

A man in a blue shirt walks from the mid-ground towards the viewer on the pedestrian path, eventually passing to the viewer's left foreground. Concurrently, two women walk away from the viewer on the same path, moving from the mid-right into the far background. On the street to the left, a black car moves further away, and a white FedEx van subsequently appears, also driving away from the viewer. Throughout the frames, people at the outdoor dining area subtly shift positions, with a server in a blue shirt becoming more distinctly visible towards the viewer's mid-right.

In the first frame, a wide paved walkway extends centrally into the distance, flanked by a street with a green bike lane on the left and a building with outdoor dining on the right. To the immediate left, a leafy tree stands with a light pole behind it, while cars are visible further down the street. On the right, an outdoor patio features yellow umbrellas, black tables, chairs, and several people dining or standing in front of a gray building with arched windows and yellow awnings. In the midground, pedestrians walk along the central walkway towards the prominent Ferry Building clock tower, which is centered in the far background under a clear blue sky.
end of description
Pedestrians on the central walkway continue moving away from the viewer, as new individuals appear from behind the initial viewpoint to walk forward. On the street to the left, a motorcycle briefly passes, followed by various cars moving away into the distance. Subsequently, a red and white bus emerges on the far left of the street, also moving away from the viewer. Subtle dynamic changes occur among the diners at the outdoor seating area on the right, with people shifting positions.
