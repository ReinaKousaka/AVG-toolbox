The first frame shows a view from a vehicle approaching a road intersection, with a roundabout containing a dark circular platform with vertical brown poles to the left. Red and white construction barriers line the road edge to the foreground right, behind which a worker in a yellow vest stands near a light yellow house with dark shutters on the far right. A street light pole with a pedestrian crossing sign is positioned near the center-right, while mountains are visible in the distance under an overcast sky.

As the frames progress, the worker on the far right moves out of view. Two orange directional signs, pointing to 'Klonatal' and 'Riedern', are newly revealed to the right of the street light pole. A dark grey SUV appears on the road ahead from the center, moving towards the viewpoint as the viewer's vehicle advances, making the pedestrian crossing markings on the road ahead more prominent.

In the first frame, a rural road with yellow pedestrian crossing markings runs from the bottom center, curving slightly right into the midground. To the immediate right, red and white construction barriers are stacked, while similar barriers line the left side of the road further back. A dark grey SUV is positioned on the left side of the road, facing away from the viewer. A street light pole with a grey rectangular sign stands to the left, behind which is a large green pine tree. Various buildings are scattered on both sides of the road in the midground, with misty mountains rising in the background under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewer's vehicle moves forward, the dark grey SUV on the left proceeds past the yellow crossing and exits the frame to the viewer's left. The street light pole and large pine tree on the left also shift closer before moving out of the frame to the left, while the yellow pedestrian crossing lines disappear beneath the viewer. Simultaneously, the construction barriers lining the right side of the road recede, and more of the road ahead is revealed. Further down the road, a red excavator becomes distinctly visible among other vehicles on the left, indicating construction activity ahead in the same relative position.

The first frame shows the viewer looking forward down a two-lane road with a construction site on the immediate left, marked by red and white striped barriers. Behind the barriers, an exposed dirt area leads to a large evergreen tree on the mid-left, beyond which a wooden building and mist-shrouded mountains are visible in the distance. On the mid-left side of the road, an orange excavator, a red flatbed truck, and a white van are parked near a street light, while on the right, a grassy verge leads to white houses and a dark, possibly ancient, building on a hill, with more misty mountains in the far distance under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the vehicle moves forward, the initial construction barriers on the left recede and pass out of frame, revealing more of the construction site and a worker standing beside the red excavator to the left of the road. Further along the left side, an orange and white traffic cone appears in the road, while the excavator and red flatbed truck continue to move past the viewer's position. On the right, the grassy verge passes by, and a red pole becomes visible near the road's edge.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a two-lane road extending into the distance under an overcast sky, with misty mountains in the background. To the immediate left, a large red excavator and construction barriers are prominent, alongside a red flatbed truck, while on the right, a green verge leads to white houses and a distant castle-like structure on a hillside.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the red excavator and initial barriers recede and completely disappear to the left. The scene then reveals the viewer passing a static line of construction vehicles and equipment, including a red flatbed truck, a yellow generator, and red containers, all while the white houses and castle on the right continue to recede in the background.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a road looking ahead. To the immediate left, a construction cone and red-and-white striped barrier are visible, followed by a yellow industrial machine, two large red containers labeled "MARTY," and a parked white flatbed truck. Further left is a bare tree and an evergreen tree, with more construction barriers and white buildings extending into the distance under a cloudy sky, backed by forested mountains. To the immediate right, a grassy shoulder with a red pole leads to a white house with a dark roof, fronted by a fence and shrubs. The road itself is gray with a solid white line on the right shoulder and a broken white center line, extending towards more buildings and distant, cloud-shrouded mountains.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the initial red-and-white barrier, yellow machinery, red containers, and white truck on the immediate left recede from view. Simultaneously, the white house on the right moves to the viewer's right, revealing a '70' speed limit sign in front of it. More of the construction site, marked by extensive wooden plank barriers and disturbed earth, becomes visible on the left. The road ahead continues to be revealed, showing more distant buildings and landscape as the vehicle proceeds.
