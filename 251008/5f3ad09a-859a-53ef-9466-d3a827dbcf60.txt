frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a paved road curving to the right in the foreground and midground, featuring a yellow center line and a metal guardrail along its left edge, opposite a rocky slope on the right. Centered in the mid-distance above the road is a large red billboard on a green pole, flanked by a snow-capped forested mountain to the left and a barren mountain to the right, all beneath a blue, cloudy sky.
end of description
As the frames advance, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the road, billboard, and surrounding mountains to progressively draw closer, increasing in perceived size. A small stack of rocks becomes visible on the right roadside, having been initially further away from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a wide, grey asphalt road curving slightly to the right, bordered by a metal guardrail on the left and a concrete retaining wall on the right. A large red billboard with Chinese text on a green pole is positioned centrally above the road. Majestic mountains with patches of snow frame the scene under a blue sky dotted with white clouds.
end of description.
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the white horizontal rumble strip markings on the asphalt to move closer to the viewer and eventually pass underneath. The billboard, guardrail, and retaining wall all appear to be approached and then passed as the perspective shifts through the curve in the mountainous terrain.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a two-lane asphalt road with a yellow center line leading into a mountain pass under a blue, cloudy sky. To the left, a large red billboard with Chinese text stands behind a guardrail, while rugged brown mountains with distant snowy peaks rise on both sides. On the right, a concrete barrier borders a rocky slope where a smaller, blank grey billboard is visible further ahead.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the large red billboard on the left and the smaller grey billboard on the right gradually move out of frame. The road continues to unfold ahead, curving slightly left into the increasingly prominent mountain pass, with the rugged slopes on either side appearing closer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a grey asphalt road with a double yellow center line and a white shoulder line extends forward, curving slightly to the right in the distance. To the left, a silver guardrail runs alongside the road, backed by snow-dusted mountains, with two signs partially visible above and behind it. On the right, a rocky hillside with sparse yellow-green bushes borders the road, featuring a large, blank grey billboard in the mid-ground.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the blank billboard initially positioned on the right slowly approaches and then exits the frame to the right of the first-frame viewpoint. The guardrail and the snow-dusted mountains to the left recede into the distance as new segments of the road and the mountainous valley ahead are continuously revealed.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a grey asphalt road extending directly in front of the viewer, featuring a continuous yellow center line and a white line along its right edge, while a metal guardrail runs parallel on the left. To the viewer's right, a concrete barrier separates the road from a steep, rocky mountain slope covered in sparse brown and green vegetation, leading up to a dominant mountain peak. Distant rugged mountains with some visible rock and sparse vegetation define the left and far background of a valley, all under a partially cloudy blue sky.

end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the road surface, the metal guardrail on the left, and the vegetated mountain slope on the right to advance *towards* the viewer and then recede *beneath* and *to the sides* of the initial viewpoint. Specific road markings, including several horizontal white lines, appear directly *in front* of the viewer in the distance before moving closer and passing *under* the vehicle. The dense vegetation and rocky terrain on the right-hand slope also continuously reveal new sections as the viewer moves past them, bringing previously more distant bushes and trees closer *to the viewer's right*. A yellow and black striped caution marker on the guardrail becomes visible *on the right* in the later frames, approaching from *further down the road* relative to the first frame.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a gray asphalt road extending directly in front of the viewer, curving slightly left in the distance, flanked by metal guardrails on its immediate left and right. Beyond these, a large, arid mountain rises prominently to the viewer's right, while a valley and more distant, tree-covered mountains are visible to the left, all beneath a blue sky with scattered clouds above.
end of description
The subsequent frames show forward movement along this road: the initial yellow center line and guardrails on the immediate left and right continuously advance and pass below the viewer. Further along, a series of white horizontal rumble strips, initially far ahead on the road, progressively appear closer and then move beneath the viewer. The surrounding mountainous landscape, to the left and right, remains in view but gradually shifts into the background relative to the advancing viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a mountain road curving right, marked by a double yellow line and guardrails on both sides. A steep, vegetated mountain rises immediately to the right, while distant, partially snow-capped mountains line the left under a blue, cloudy sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the winding road, causing the immediate guardrails and roadside bushes, initially ahead, to draw closer and pass behind the viewer. The continuous advancement through the rightward curve progressively reveals more of the right mountainside and the deepening valley ahead, expanding the scene from the original viewpoint.
