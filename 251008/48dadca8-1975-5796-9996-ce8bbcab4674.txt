The first frame captures a night scene of a city street intersection. A crosswalk with white stripes lies in the mid-ground, leading to a sidewalk on the left where a prominent "BVLGARI" store with a golden facade and a "MIKIMOTO" store are brightly lit. An "NYPD" barrier and a traffic light showing a red signal are positioned mid-left, near the crosswalk. To the right, an illuminated building with an American flag overlooks a street with several parked and moving cars, while towering city buildings extend into the dark background.

Chronologically, the traffic light in the mid-left transitions from red to green. A person in a pink coat begins crossing the street from the right side of the crosswalk towards the left, while a dark SUV drives further right, away from the viewer, on the street to the right.

The first frame presents a nighttime city street scene, with the viewer positioned on a wet street featuring crosswalk lines and a manhole cover in the immediate foreground. To the mid-left, prominent luxury storefronts for Mikimoto and Bvlgari are brightly illuminated, with a few pedestrians visible on the sidewalk in front. Towards the mid-right and extending into the background, a street intersection is visible with traffic lights and street signs, where several pedestrians stand on a crosswalk and cars appear further down the street with headlights on. Tall city buildings with numerous lit windows line both sides of the street, receding into the dark background.

Throughout the subsequent frames, movement unfolds across the street scene. A pedestrian on the left sidewalk walks rightward past the Bvlgari storefront, while another moves leftward into the Mikimoto area. Simultaneously, the group of pedestrians on the right-side crosswalk progresses forward, moving closer to the viewer. The traffic light on the right, initially yellow, changes to green. Finally, a dark sedan with illuminated headlights enters the frame from the far right and drives leftward across the crosswalk, passing the pedestrians and obscuring part of the street as it continues towards the left of the frame.
