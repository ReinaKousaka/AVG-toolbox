In the first frame, a paved urban area is visible under a clear blue sky, with dense green trees lining the left and distant buildings in the background. To the viewer's immediate right, a man in a black shirt is partially seen, while a white van is parked next to a glass-paneled structure and a few pedestrians walk from right to left across the mid-ground.

The man on the right gradually moves out of frame to the right, revealing more of the foreground pavement. Simultaneously, the group of pedestrians in the mid-ground continues to walk towards the left, eventually exiting the frame. A black SUV drives leftward across the distant road, followed by a white car, while a bicyclist with a red trailer emerges from the distant right, moving rightward past the remaining pedestrians and out of frame. Throughout the sequence, various other vehicles and pedestrians animate the background from the first-frame viewpoint, with the entire scene subtly panning to the right.

The first frame displays a sunny city intersection under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a wide asphalt road features a prominent white-striped crosswalk. Several pedestrians are visible on and near the crosswalk, mostly in the midground, with a person on a red cargo bike and another on a regular bicycle positioned to the left of the crosswalk, facing right. To the far left, multiple cars, including a white sedan and a white van, are stopped. On the right, a paved area with tactile strips borders a green space with bushes and trees, where two electric scooters (one white, one green/black) are parked. In the background, city buildings, traffic lights, and streetlights are present.
end of description
Throughout the frames, people continue walking across the crosswalk from left to right and right to left, largely moving away from the first-frame viewpoint. A large white van, initially stopped on the far left, proceeds across the intersection towards the right, passing the cargo bike and eventually moving out of view. Other vehicles in the background also move through the intersection to the left and right. The person on the red cargo bike and the adjacent cyclist remain relatively stationary near the left side of the crosswalk.
