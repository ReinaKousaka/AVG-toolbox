The first frame shows a street scene from a sidewalk viewpoint. In the foreground, slightly left, a grey recycling bin stands beside the sidewalk. To the left, a low stone wall with railings curves alongside a road, where a yellow double-decker bus and a white car are partially visible in the distance. A two-lane road occupies the mid-ground, with a dark blue pickup truck partially visible on the far right, moving away from the viewer. Across the road, a row of multi-story buildings, including a brown building labeled 'LODGE' on the right, lines the street, with pedestrians on the opposite sidewalk.
end of description
The dark blue pickup truck moves entirely out of the frame to the right. Simultaneously, a white van enters from the left on the curved road, driving towards the viewer. Pedestrians on the far side of the road continue to move, with more gathering on the far right corner. A red traffic light becomes fully visible at this corner, and the yellow bus and initial white car on the left move further out of view.
