The first frame displays an outdoor market on a cobblestone plaza, featuring a partial white 'Bäckerei' stall with baked goods on the immediate right. In the mid-ground, a red 'Weingut Möllinger Hof' stall is surrounded by patrons, with a black chalkboard sign standing to its left. Further left and in the background, pedestrians walk amidst other market stalls with green awnings, set against a backdrop of multi-story buildings under an overcast sky.

Throughout the following frames, pedestrians in the left background and individuals around the red stall are seen moving.

The first frame depicts a bustling market square with a cobblestone ground. To the viewer's right is a red market stall with a striped awning and a sign reading "Weingut Mönchberger Hof," where a vendor serves customers, and a small red table stands further right. Slightly to the left of the foreground, a black A-frame chalkboard advertises "Weißer Glühwein," while the midground on the left is filled with pedestrians and other market stalls featuring green and white striped awnings, leading towards multi-story buildings in the background.

In the following frames, a person in a dark jacket walks from behind the chalkboard sign towards the red stall in the mid-ground. Simultaneously, another individual in a fur-lined hood moves from the mid-ground right to stand by the red stall, eventually turning to face the first person. Pedestrians on the left side of the path continue their movement further into the scene and closer to the viewer.
