The first frame shows a narrow, wet street at night under heavy rain. To the viewer's left, a low stone wall with a decorative top runs alongside the road, leading into the midground where some dark trees are visible. On the right, a dark blue car's fender is partially visible in the immediate foreground, with an orange traffic cone lying on the wet asphalt road nearby. Further ahead on the right, a dark grey sedan is parked, its surface reflecting light from overhead streetlights, next to a building wall that is heavily saturated and streaming with water. In the misty distance, the road appears to curve slightly, revealing distant red lights and another white car.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the heavy rainfall persists, causing noticeable water streams to cascade more prominently down the right-side building wall relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The wet street surface in front of the viewer and extending into the midground shows continuous ripples and splashes from the intense downpour. Subtle changes in the ambient misty glow around the distant cars and red lights indicate the ongoing atmospheric conditions of the stormy night.

The first frame depicts a dark, wet street at night under heavy rain. To the viewer's right, a dark sedan is parked, partially obscuring a white and orange traffic cone in the foreground. On the left, a textured brick wall with a traditional tiled roof recedes into the distance, featuring a wooden door. A rugged, wet wall on the right shows water streaming down its surface. Further down the street, blurred by the intense rain, other vehicles with illuminated red taillights and distant streetlights are visible.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the heavy rain persists, causing significant dynamic changes in the water levels on the street. Puddles continually expand and deepen, notably around the parked dark car and along the right wall where water cascades down. The visible accumulation and movement of water across the street steadily increase, indicating a rising water level in the entire scene.

The first frame shows a dark, narrow street at night under heavy rain, with a black car parked on the wet pavement to the viewer's right and a stone wall with illuminated red lights running along the left side towards distant cars and streetlights further up the road.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, the heavy rainfall persists, causing water to visibly stream down the walls and accumulate on the ground, while all vehicles remain stationary in their initial positions relative to the viewer.
