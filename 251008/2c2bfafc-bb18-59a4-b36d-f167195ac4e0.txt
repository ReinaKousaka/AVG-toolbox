The first frame displays a rainy city street at night. In the midground, a blue city bus with "601" on its rear and a smaller blue car are visible on the wet asphalt road, both moving away from the viewer with their red brake lights illuminated. To the right, a wet sidewalk includes a dark pole with a red fire hydrant, while on the left, multi-story buildings with illuminated windows and a red traffic light line the street.

The small blue car progressively moves forward and slightly to the left relative to its initial position. Subsequently, a white car appears further down the road, behind the blue car and to the left of the bus, also moving away from the viewer. The traffic light on the far left transitions from red to green, then back to red, while the bus largely holds its position. The camera viewpoint subtly shifts, making the red fire hydrant in the right foreground appear closer to the viewer.

In the first frame, a rainy urban street at night is depicted. To the bottom right, a red fire hydrant and an ornate black lamppost stand on a wet sidewalk featuring yellow tactile paving. A wet asphalt road stretches into the midground, reflecting multiple red lights from vehicles and traffic signals, along with building illuminations. A blue car is visible in the left lane, partially facing away, while a white car is positioned further back in the right lane, also facing away from the viewer. Tall buildings with glowing windows and signs line the left side, and in the distant right background, a blue bus is seen moving away from the viewer.
end of description
As the frames progress, the blue bus on the far right in the background slowly moves further away. Concurrently, the green traffic light on the far left turns off, while the red traffic lights to the right remain illuminated. A pedestrian carrying a black umbrella and wearing a light-colored jacket appears from the right background and walks along the sidewalk towards the midground.

The first frame reveals a rainy city street at night, with an ornate street pole in the foreground on the right. In the midground, a blue car is on the far left, a silver car is turning right, and a person with an umbrella is crossing from mid-right towards mid-left, all against a backdrop of illuminated buildings and distant red traffic lights.
end of description.
Dynamically, the blue car exits to the far left, the silver car completes its right turn and proceeds forward into the background, and the umbrella-holding person continues walking across the street from mid-right to mid-left.
