The first frame shows a paved pathway leading into the distance, with a white line marking its left edge. To the right, a concrete curb separates the path from a marina filled with numerous boats and yachts, behind a dark metal fence, all under several tall palm trees. A round grey bollard is in the bottom right foreground. On the left side, behind more palm trees, are buildings and parked cars. In the middle ground, a woman with a light brown dog on a leash walks towards the viewer from the left, while a man in purple walks away from the viewer on the right. More distant figures, some with dogs, are also on the path. The background reveals a cloudy sky with sunset hues over water and a faint bridge structure.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint appears to slowly move forward. The woman with the dog walks steadily closer to the viewer from the left side of the path, eventually passing to the left foreground. Simultaneously, the man in the purple shirt continues walking away from the viewer on the right, progressively becoming smaller and moving further into the distance. Other people and dogs also move along the path, either approaching or receding from the first-frame viewpoint, altering their positions within the visible path.
