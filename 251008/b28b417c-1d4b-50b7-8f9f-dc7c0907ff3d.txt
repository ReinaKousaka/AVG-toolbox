The first frame shows a snowy street intersection at night, with fresh snow covering the road and sidewalks, and snowflakes visibly falling. A person holding a black umbrella is walking from the right foreground towards the left across the intersection's crosswalk. In the background, to the left, a car with headlights on is visible on the street, and buildings with illuminated windows stand behind trees, with a red traffic light on the far left. To the right, another street extends into the distance, lined with trees and streetlights, and a green traffic light hangs above the intersection, with a 'Davie St' sign visible.

The person holding the umbrella continues walking from the right foreground across the snow-covered street towards the left. As the person progresses, a red construction hoarding on the far right sidewalk, previously partially obscured, becomes increasingly visible. Concurrently, the green traffic light hanging above the intersection changes to yellow, then to red, while the pedestrian signal on the far left transitions from red to green.

Construction barriers and a green utility box stand to the right of the snowy sidewalk, and a distant vehicle's headlights are faintly visible down the street to the left.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, snow continues to fall as the traffic light on the right transitions from red to yellow, then to green. Simultaneously, a vehicle slowly approaches from the far left, its headlights becoming brighter as it enters and crosses the intersection. Near the end of the sequence, a pedestrian appears from the right, walking along the sidewalk adjacent to the construction barriers.

The first frame shows a snowy city street at night from a low-angle viewpoint. In the foreground, a snow-covered road with tire tracks extends towards the viewer, with a visible crosswalk line. To the left, a car is partially visible on the road, while the street continues into the distance lined by snow-dusted trees and illuminated buildings. Centrally positioned above the street is a traffic light displaying green. To the right, a snow-covered sidewalk features footprints, orange traffic cones, a green utility box, and a red construction barrier, beyond which a person walks away from the viewer.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the car positioned on the left side of the street begins to move away from the viewer, kicking up snow as it proceeds. Simultaneously, the person walking on the sidewalk to the right continues to move further away from the initial viewpoint. The snowfall persists throughout the scene.

The first frame captures a snowy city street at night, featuring a snow-covered road on the left with a car and distant streetlights, and a sidewalk on the right with a person, red construction barriers, a green utility box, and orange bollards. A traffic light pole with a green signal stands centrally at the intersection. end of description.
Subsequently, the person on the sidewalk walks away from the viewer, moving past the bollards and further along the red barrier, while snow continues to fall. In the final frames, a large blue and white bus appears on the street to the left, traveling past the intersection towards the viewer's right, now partially obscuring the earlier car.

The first frame depicts a snowy city street scene at night. To the left, a blue and yellow city bus moves away from the viewer on the snow-covered road. A pedestrian in a white vest and dark pants walks on the snow-covered sidewalk towards the viewer, positioned centrally to the right of a traffic light pole with a green signal. To the far right, a long red construction fence lines the sidewalk, marked with "KINDRED," with three red bollards in the foreground. Trees and distant buildings are visible along the street, under falling snow.
end of description
The pedestrian continues walking towards the traffic light pole, progressively moving closer to the pole and slightly left from their initial position, eventually stopping next to it, now facing away from the viewer. Concurrently, the bus continues to move away from the viewer to the left, gradually exiting the frame. In the later frames, the pedestrian signal changes from white to a red 'Don't Walk' symbol, accompanied by a numerical countdown above it, while the main traffic light remains green. The falling snow and other background elements persist unchanged.

The first frame captures a snowy night scene from a sidewalk, featuring a person in a light-colored hooded jacket standing near a pole with a traffic light showing green and a pedestrian countdown of '9'. To the left, a dark bus moves away on the snow-covered street, while a red construction barrier runs along the right side of the sidewalk.
end of description
As the frames progress, the bus on the left continuously moves further away from the viewer, revealing more of its rear. Simultaneously, the pedestrian signal's red countdown decrements from '9' to '8' then '7', displaying a stop hand, while snow continues to fall across the scene.
