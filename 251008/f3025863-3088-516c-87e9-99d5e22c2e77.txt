In the first frame, the viewer is on a wet, paved sidewalk with a building displaying a large green sign to their immediate right. To the left, a white SUV is parked on a wet asphalt road marked by a yellow curb, behind which other vehicles and distant buildings are visible. Ahead, a series of trees and light poles line the sidewalk, with a blue "50m" sign mounted on a pole to the upper left; a man holding a white umbrella is walking away from the viewer along the right side of the sidewalk.

The man with the white umbrella moves completely out of the frame to the right. Subsequently, the white SUV on the road to the viewer's left drives forward, revealing more of the road and a dark sedan behind it, which then also moves forward. Pedestrians with umbrellas continue to move further down the sidewalk away from the viewer, while traffic lights reflect red on the wet road surface to the left.

In the first frame, a wet city street stretches into the distance under an overcast sky, with the viewer positioned on a sidewalk. To the immediate left, a partial white car and a tall utility pole with a camera are visible, near a white trash bag and a blue-handled broom on the wet pavement. Further left on the street, a black car with red taillights is stopped, next to a person holding a black umbrella. Along the midground, two grey utility boxes are on the sidewalk, with multiple trees and streetlights lining the road. To the right, a large building features a prominent green and blue billboard.

Chronologically, the black car in the midground begins to move forward, its red taillights receding into the distance. The person with the black umbrella near the pole remains mostly stationary, while pedestrians further down the street continue walking with umbrellas. The white car in the foreground appears to be stationary throughout the sequence.

The first frame captures a rainy city street scene, with a wet sidewalk on the right and a wet road extending into the distance on the left. In the foreground left, a person holds a black umbrella near a utility pole and a trash bag, with a dark car behind them; two utility boxes are positioned further along the mid-ground left sidewalk, while a building with a large green poster is prominent on the right, and pedestrians with umbrellas are visible in the far distance.
end of description
As frames progress, the dark car on the mid-ground left slowly advances forward. Simultaneously, pedestrians with umbrellas, including a person with a green umbrella and another holding a dark one, emerge from the far right and mid-ground right respectively, walking towards the viewer along the right sidewalk.
