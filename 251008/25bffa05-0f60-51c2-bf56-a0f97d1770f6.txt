In the first frame, a parking lot and road extend away from the viewer towards a large green mountain under a cloudy blue sky. Immediately to the right, a flower box with red and purple flowers sits alongside a paved path and the dark facade of a building, with a black van parked parallel to the viewer. On the left, two black cars are parked, one facing the viewer, next to a post. Further down the asphalt road, a red car is parked on the right, and a landscaped island with flowers and trees is visible on the left, beyond which other vehicles are sparsely parked. A tall streetlamp stands on the right side of the road, mid-distance.

The camera slowly pans left, revealing more of the parking lot and cars on the left, including a white parking sign post, while the black van and building facade on the far right gradually move out of view. The red car, initially partially visible on the right, becomes more centered on that side before it also begins to exit the frame right. Concurrently, the round, landscaped island in the middle of the road becomes more prominent and central, with the distant mountain remaining a constant background feature.

The first frame depicts a wide outdoor scene with a paved road curving through the foreground and midground, leading towards distant green mountains under a partly cloudy sky. On the far left, the front of a blue car is partially visible, while to the right, a red car is parked along a sidewalk adjacent to a building facade. A triangular flower bed with red and white blossoms forms a central road island in the midground. A dark grey SUV is positioned on the road approaching this island from the right, with a black convertible behind it, also moving towards the center. Further along the right sidewalk, a black SUV is parked, and beyond the road, a park area with trees and a light-colored monument extends towards the mountain range.

Subsequently, the red car parked on the right begins to reverse and moves out of view. Concurrently, the black convertible in the midground drives forward and slightly right, crossing the viewer's path. The dark grey SUV also proceeds forward, turning left around the central flower bed. A group of people emerges and becomes visible walking on the sidewalk to the right, behind the original position of the red car.

The first frame displays an asphalt road in the foreground, with a flowerbed featuring red and white flowers to the left. A dark minivan is positioned centrally on the road, with a black convertible to its right, and a group of people are walking on a sidewalk to the far right. Beyond the road, a large green park stretches towards distant, majestic mountains under a blue sky with scattered clouds.
end of description
As the frames progress, the dark minivan moves forward on the road towards the left, while the group of people on the right sidewalk walk further to the left, past their initial first-frame positions. Subsequently, a red hatchback emerges from the far left, behind the flowerbed, entering the road and turning towards the right, followed closely by a dark SUV.
