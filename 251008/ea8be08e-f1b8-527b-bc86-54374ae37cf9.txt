The first frame displays a snowy city street extending into the distance under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's immediate left, a light-colored building with large reflective windows and potted plants lines a wet sidewalk, while to the right, a multi-story building with shops like "GALLERY METRO" and balconies runs alongside the street, which has a small snow pile on its edge.

The camera smoothly moves forward along the left-hand sidewalk. This movement reveals new sections of the building on the left, with an entrance for "LEDER" and then "GRIEDER" becoming visible further down the street from the initial viewpoint. The buildings on the right and the street continue to recede into the distance as the scene unfolds.
