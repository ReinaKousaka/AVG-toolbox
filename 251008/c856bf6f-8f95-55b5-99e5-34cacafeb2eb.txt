In the first frame, a wide view looks down a city street and river. To the left, a dark metal railing separates a paved pedestrian walkway from a flowing river. On the river's far bank, numerous multi-story buildings with varied architecture line the water, extending into the distance where a bridge is visible. To the right of the walkway, tram tracks run parallel into the background, flanked by lampposts and overhead wires. Alongside the tracks on the right, a row of ornate multi-story buildings houses shops, with several pedestrians on their adjacent sidewalk and a large yellow construction vehicle parked further down.
end of description
A group of people walking on the left side of the street (near the tram tracks) progresses towards the viewer throughout the sequence. A cyclist, initially behind this group, then rides alongside and past them, also moving towards the viewer. On the right sidewalk, pedestrians near the orange construction vehicle subtly shift positions, and an individual eventually appears to be operating the vehicle. Further right, a person is seen sitting under the arched structure in the later frames.

The first frame presents a city riverside scene under an overcast sky. A dark metal railing runs along the bottom left, bordering a wide river with distant buildings and a bridge visible on its far bank, to the left of the viewer. To the right, a paved sidewalk and a street with tram tracks extend into the distance, lined by multi-story buildings, and populated by pedestrians and a stationary yellow construction vehicle in the mid-ground right.
end of description
In subsequent frames, a cyclist, initially in the mid-ground right on the street near the tram tracks, rapidly moves forward towards the viewer, passing to the bottom right out of the frame. Concurrently, several pedestrians on the sidewalk and crossing the street exhibit subtle, slow movements relative to their initial positions. The distant buildings, river, and the construction vehicle remain static throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a paved pedestrian walkway extends from the viewer's foreground into the midground, with a dark metal railing to its left bordering a river. Across the river, in the left background, a series of buildings, some with distinctive roofs and a green-domed tower, line the distant bank. To the right of the walkway, a road with tram tracks runs parallel, flanked by multi-story buildings with shops on the ground level, while several pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk and near the road.
end of description
No dynamic changes occur, and no new objects or scenes are revealed in the subsequent frames; all nine frames are identical.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A riverside urban scene is depicted on an overcast day. To the left, a dark metal railing borders a flowing river, beyond which numerous buildings with light facades and dark roofs line the opposite bank, extending to a distant bridge. A wide grey paved sidewalk occupies the midground-right, with a tall utility pole centrally positioned. To the right of the sidewalk is a street featuring tram tracks, flanked by a continuous row of multi-story buildings. Several pedestrians are scattered along the sidewalk and street in the mid-to-far distance.
end of description
A group of three women on the sidewalk, initially in the mid-distance right, walk towards the viewer, becoming more prominent in the foreground. Another pedestrian appears behind them, also moving forward. Towards the end of the sequence, a cyclist enters the street from the far background on the right and rides towards the camera, passing behind the pedestrians.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a wide street scene under an overcast sky, with a dark railing on the left bordering a river and historic buildings beyond. On the right, a row of multi-story buildings with white facades lines a street featuring tram tracks, where three women walk on the sidewalk towards the viewer, and a man cycles further ahead.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the three women on the sidewalk and the bicyclist continue moving forward, passing the viewer and eventually exiting the frame from the bottom. As the foreground clears, more distant pedestrians become visible on the street, and a yellow tram-like vehicle appears further down the street on the right.
