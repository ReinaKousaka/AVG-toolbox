The first frame shows a bustling city street from a low vantage point, looking down a long thoroughfare. In the immediate foreground, a street with tram tracks stretches away from the viewer. To the viewer's left, a large building under construction is covered with scaffolding and two prominent banners advertising "2 QUEEN WEST," with pedestrians visible on the sidewalk in front of it and amber traffic lights above. To the viewer's right, an ornate historical building with "SALUS" signage has pedestrians on its sidewalk and green traffic lights indicating flow for a cross-street. In the midground, a group of pedestrians is actively crossing the street on a marked crosswalk, while a dark car is partially visible on the far right, moving away. The background reveals more distant buildings and traffic lights, extending into a bright, sunlit skyline.
end of description
Pedestrians on the crosswalk continue to move across the street from both sides, gradually clearing the central intersection and moving further away from the viewer. Simultaneously, new pedestrians emerge from the sidewalks to the viewer's left and right, joining the flow across the street. The dark car initially on the right continues to move away, while a lighter-colored vehicle becomes visible further down the street, approaching the intersection.
