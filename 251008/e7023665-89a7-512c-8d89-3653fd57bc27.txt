A paved path leads forward from the viewer, with two light-colored wooden benches and green bushes situated on the right. To the left, a wooden boardwalk runs alongside a body of water, separated by a metal fence with horizontal cables; three figures (two adults and a child) stand on this boardwalk towards the left-center. In the background, a large suspension bridge spans horizontally across the frame above the water, with a cityscape of buildings visible on the far bank beneath a clear blue sky.
end of description
The two adults and child on the boardwalk in the midground subtly shift their postures. Subsequently, a new individual emerges from behind the bushes on the far right of the first-frame viewpoint, stepping onto the paved path. This person then walks along the paved path towards the left-center, moving behind the benches and approaching the group on the boardwalk.

In the first frame, a paved path diagonally crosses the foreground from bottom-left to mid-right, flanked by a wooden bench on the viewer's right and a wooden boardwalk on the left, separated by a railing from a river. Across the mid-ground river, a distant cityscape with a large suspension bridge spans the background under a clear blue sky. On the boardwalk, to the left of the path, a group of three adults and a small child are visible, while another adult stands further right along the boardwalk near bushes on the right bank.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the child on the boardwalk moves closer to and then behind the adult group, while the adult from the far right walks left along the boardwalk to join them. A sixth person appears from the viewer's right and joins the group, which then collectively moves further towards the viewer's left along the boardwalk.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a wide wooden boardwalk occupies the foreground and midground, flanked by a calm body of water with a metal railing on the left and sparse trees and a wooden bench on the right. Five people walk on the boardwalk from the midground towards the viewer, while in the background, a cityscape with buildings and a large suspension bridge spans across the water under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the initial group of five individuals on the boardwalk continues moving closer to the viewer, traveling from the midground towards the foreground and slightly towards the viewer's left. A small child in a green top emerges from behind and to the left of the leftmost woman in the original group, also walking towards the viewer. Concurrently, a sixth adult figure becomes visible further down the path, behind the initial group and slightly to the right of their path, also approaching the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a boardwalk bordering a river with a suspension bridge and city skyline across it in the background, under a blue sky. In the foreground, a wooden bench is to the right, while a group of people walk leftward on the boardwalk.
end of description
As the frames progress, the pedestrians steadily walk further to the left of their initial positions, with the woman in the mask and red bag eventually exiting the frame entirely to the far left. The man in black sunglasses and the couple behind him continue moving leftward, revealing more of the boardwalk and river area previously obscured by their presence, always remaining to the left of the static bench and shrubbery.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a man in a dark jacket and cap is prominent in the left foreground, walking towards the viewer's left with a woman looking at her phone, while a wooden park bench is visible on the right. A wooden boardwalk extends from the midground into the distance, bordered by a metal fence alongside a river on the left, with a large suspension bridge and distant city buildings defining the background under a blue sky, and other pedestrians walking further along the path.
end of description
The foreground man and woman continue moving left and eventually exit the frame as the scene progresses. Concurrently, the camera slightly advances forward, bringing the midground section of the boardwalk and the previously distant pedestrians closer to the viewer's updated position. The background bridge and city remain static relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a waterfront park with a wooden boardwalk on the left, alongside a metal railing overlooking a body of water. To the right, a paved path is bordered by sparse green vegetation and a thin tree trunk, with numerous pedestrians walking further along it. In the midground, the Manhattan Bridge spans the scene against a blue sky, while two individuals, a man with a backpack and a woman in a denim jacket, walk towards the viewer on the boardwalk.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the two central pedestrians on the boardwalk continuously approach closer to the viewer. Other individuals present further along the paved path and on the boardwalk move slightly, but no new objects or scenes are revealed, with the bridge and landscape remaining static in the background.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a man and a woman walking towards the viewer on a wooden boardwalk, bordered by a metal railing separating it from water on the left, with a large suspension bridge spanning the background and other pedestrians visible further down the path.
end of description
The initial pair continues walking past the viewer and exits the frame to the left. Concurrently, a new couple, previously positioned behind them, emerges and walks along the boardwalk from the mid-ground, center-right, towards and then past the viewer. Two additional individuals then follow this couple, also moving towards the viewer and steadily progressing past the original viewpoint.
