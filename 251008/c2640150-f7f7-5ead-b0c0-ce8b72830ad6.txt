First, the frame displays a bustling city street at dusk, looking down a wide boulevard with illuminated storefronts and pedestrians on the left sidewalk, while a street busy with cars driving into the distance occupies the right, framed by bare trees and ornate buildings.
end of description
The two individuals in the left foreground continue walking further away from the viewer, as new pedestrians emerge from the left, moving towards the midground. Simultaneously, cars on the right continuously drive further away, with new vehicles entering the scene from the background, and a green trash bin is revealed behind the central tree trunk in the midground.

The first frame captures a city street at dusk, with a man and a woman walking away from the viewer on the left foreground sidewalk, past illuminated storefronts like "CALZEDONIA" and a building marked "HOTEL." To the right, a bare tree trunk, a street lamp, and a grey trash can occupy the midground, while cars move leftward on the street and buildings line the background.
end of description
Subsequently, the man and woman continue walking further away on the left sidewalk. Vehicles on the street, including a dark car initially in the mid-right, proceed leftward past the viewer's original position, with a white van appearing behind it. Concurrently, the traffic light visible on the left-midground transitions from red to green.

In the first frame, a tree trunk and a gray trash bin are prominently visible in the foreground right, beside a pole with various signs. To the left, a bustling cafe with illuminated yellow trim and large windows occupies the midground, with pedestrians walking on the adjacent sidewalk towards a crosswalk in the center, behind which a brightly lit billboard stands. On the right, a white van drives away on a multi-lane street, flanked by tall city buildings.
end of description
As the frames progress, the white van continues to move further away on the street, while a large white tour bus enters from the right, slowly advancing into the midground right lane. Simultaneously, pedestrians on the midground left and center sidewalks continue their movement, with some crossing the street. The traffic light on the left, next to the cafe, changes from red to green.

The first frame displays a street scene with a large tree trunk and a dark pole with a '38' sign on the far right, partially obscuring a parked black bicycle. To the left, a sidewalk features a crosswalk occupied by several pedestrians walking rightwards, alongside a multi-story building with illuminated windows, "HOTEL" and "McDonald's" signs. In the midground, a "RUE DU HELDER" street sign and a bright rectangular billboard are visible on the left, while a street on the right shows a white bus, a white van, and another pedestrian further down.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the pedestrians on the left foreground continue walking from left to right across the crosswalk. Simultaneously, the white van and the white bus positioned on the right side of the street gradually move forward, receding further away from the viewer. A lone pedestrian also continues to cross the street from the right side towards the left, further in the distance.

In the first frame, a blurred tree trunk and a bicycle wheel are visible in the immediate foreground on the right. Centrally, a person in a dark coat stands on a crosswalk, facing away from the viewer, while to the left stands a large building with extensive glass windows displaying "McDonald's" and "Burger King" signs, accompanied by parked scooters and a red traffic light. To the right of the crosswalk, a "RUE DU HELDER" street sign stands near a brightly lit advertising display, with a street extending into the distance where cars and pedestrians are visible. Tall city buildings line both sides of the street in the background under a dim, overcast sky.

end of description

The person on the crosswalk gradually walks forward, moving away from the viewer. Concurrently, the traffic light on the left, which was initially red, switches to green. Vehicular traffic on the far side of the street, to the right of the crosswalk, continues its movement, and other pedestrians on the distant sidewalk also proceed along their path.

The first frame captures a Parisian street scene at dusk, with a pedestrian crossing directly in the foreground. To the viewer's left, a large building with "Burger King" and "McDonald's" signs illuminates the street, with parked bikes and scooters on the sidewalk, and a traffic light pole near a "no entry" sign. A woman in a dark coat walks away from the viewer on the crosswalk, towards a bright blank billboard and a street sign for "Rue du Helder" on the right, where cars are parked and other pedestrians are visible further down.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the woman in the dark coat steadily progresses across the pedestrian crossing towards the right sidewalk, eventually walking further away from the viewer along the right-hand street. Concurrently, another pedestrian on the far right side of the main street moves across it towards the viewer's left.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a city street at twilight, with a pedestrian crosswalk directly in the foreground. To the left, a commercial building houses a Burger King and McDonald's, featuring outdoor seating and parked bicycles. On the right, a wide sidewalk displays a large, illuminated blank billboard and a parked scooter, while historic buildings line the street receding into the distance, with vehicles on the road and people on the sidewalks.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, pedestrians initially visible on the right sidewalk near the billboard move forward and away from the viewer. Concurrently, additional pedestrians emerge from behind the billboard and continue along the right-hand sidewalk, while others become visible and walk forward on the left-hand sidewalk, passing the outdoor dining area. Furthermore, a new pedestrian is seen crossing the street in the midground to the far right, moving from right to left across the road.
