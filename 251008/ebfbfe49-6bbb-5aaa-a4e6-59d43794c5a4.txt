frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame captures a sunlit urban intersection, with tram tracks curving across the asphalt in the foreground. To the left, a multi-story building under construction, enveloped in scaffolding and partially obscured by a red crane, stands behind a white barrier with parked bicycles. On the right, a large grey building with a modern metal canopy structure functions as a bustling public transport stop, housing numerous pedestrians.

end of description
As the video progresses, the viewer's perspective moves forward and right, causing the entire scene to shift leftward across the frame. The construction building on the left reveals more of its central and right-hand facade, while the public transport building on the right progressively shifts out of view to the left. Simultaneously, pedestrians on the street and sidewalks continue to move.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a wide asphalt road with multiple tram tracks curving from the bottom-left towards the mid-left. Numerous overhead wires crisscross the bright blue sky. In the mid-left, a large building is under extensive construction, featuring scaffolding and a prominent red construction crane behind it, with a row of parked bicycles at its base. To the mid-right, a modern covered structure, possibly an entrance or station, is also under construction, with a historical building topped by a belfry visible behind it in the background right. Several pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk in the mid-right.
end of description
Over the following frames, the people on the right sidewalk continue walking further into the scene towards the right background. Concurrently, a person in a yellow vest appears from the far left foreground and walks towards the midground. The overall viewpoint subtly shifts slightly forward and to the right, causing the 'BUS' marking on the road to become more central and the buildings on the far left to appear marginally closer.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a city street with tram tracks curving from the bottom-left into the distance. To the right, a paved road leads towards a construction site featuring a large building under scaffolding, a red crane, and a line of parked bicycles. Far left, a person in a yellow vest walks away from the viewer amidst a row of buildings, while a red traffic light stands near the center-right.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, the person in the yellow vest on the far left continues to recede further into the distance, moving away from the viewer and slightly to the left. Concurrently, subtle changes in the appearance and position of small clouds are visible in the bright blue sky above the construction site.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a paved road with a solid white line and a broken yellow line extends towards the center-right foreground. To the immediate left, multiple tram tracks run parallel to the road, curving slightly into the midground where a person in a high-visibility vest walks leftwards. On the right, a multi-story building under construction is partially obscured by scaffolding and netting, with a long row of parked bicycles lining the sidewalk directly in front of it. Further left in the midground, several older, ornate buildings line a street, while the background reveals a clear blue sky and a large red construction crane partially hidden behind the rightmost building.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly moves forward and slightly to the right. The person previously on the mid-left moves further left and deeper into the scene, continuing away from the first-frame viewpoint. Progressively, new bicycles and additional construction elements are revealed further to the right of the initial row of bikes, slightly forward of their original position. The tram tracks on the far left of the initial view gradually recede from sight, moving out of the frame to the left of the original viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, multiple parallel tram tracks occupy the left foreground, running parallel to a paved road with a white dashed center line and a yellow line on its right. To the right of the road stands a large building under construction, partially covered in dark netting, with a prominent ground-level entrance and numerous parked bicycles lining the curb in front of it. Further left, a row of multi-story buildings, including one with a hotel sign, extends into the midground, all beneath a blue sky crisscrossed by overhead wires.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The building under construction on the right appears to shift leftward relative to the initial frame's center, revealing more of its lower structure and the entrance. The row of parked bicycles on the right gradually recedes from view as temporary white barriers and black fencing around the entrance become more prominent. Additionally, pedestrians become visible emerging from the entrance on the right as the viewer passes the area.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a city street is visible under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left, multiple sets of tram tracks run parallel to a paved road that curves gently to the right in the center. Along the left side of the road, a row of ornate multi-story buildings, some displaying flags, recede into the distance. On the far right, a large building undergoing construction is partially obscured by dark netting and white hoardings, with a street sign "Rue du Mont-Blanc" visible on its corner. Several cars are on the road in the midground and parked on the right, framed by streetlights and overhead wires.
end of description
A large red construction crane gradually emerges from *above the right-side construction site*, extending its boom upwards and further to the right across the frames, eventually revealing its full vertical mast *behind the initial building facade*. Concurrently, a large white concrete barrier appears *on the right side of the road, behind the initial fence* and subsequently extends further along the sidewalk. A few pedestrians become visible *on the right sidewalk next to the expanding barriers*, moving *towards the viewer*.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a wide street with tram tracks on the left extends towards the horizon under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds. To the left, a grand multi-story building marked "HOTEL" dominates, with other buildings receding into the distance. The center and right feature an asphalt road with white lane markings, leading past a small monument or fountain in the mid-left, towards a cluster of moving and parked cars, and streetlights. On the far right, a large building covered in white scaffolding is topped by a towering red construction crane, with white barriers and a few pedestrians on the sidewalk beside it.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the street, the tram tracks and road markings recede, and the buildings on both the left and right sides gradually reveal more of their facades. A dark car initially on the left tram tracks advances further along the road, while a white van in the mid-left briefly appears to move forward before being obscured. More parked cars, including several taxis, become increasingly visible along the right sidewalk, and pedestrians move forward then recede behind the white barriers. The red construction crane on the right and the hotel building on the left remain prominent, shifting slightly to the sides as the viewpoint advances through the scene.
