The first frame displays a wet, reflective city street at night. To the left, a dark grey SUV is parked on the road, behind which stands a modern building with large glass windows and prominent blue neon lighting. On the right, a narrow thoroughfare is flanked by brightly lit storefronts and a tall, cylindrical white sign, with a yellow delivery scooter, carrying a large box, stopped in the mid-ground. Pedestrians are visible further down the street in the distance.

The yellow delivery scooter, positioned to the right of the viewer, repeatedly flashes its brake light, intensifying its reflection on the wet pavement. Simultaneously, steam or mist emanating from the area behind the scooter on the right fluctuates in visibility and density. Slight movement is observed among the pedestrians on the distant sidewalk to the left.

The first frame presents a rainy night street scene. On the far left foreground, a grey SUV is parked with its rear facing the viewer, while to the right foreground, a yellow delivery scooter with a large cargo box is also parked, facing away. Behind these vehicles, a wet pedestrian area reflects neon and streetlights from the surrounding buildings. To the left midground, a modern building with blue neon accents and large windows extends into the distance, paralleled on the right by an older building featuring various glowing signs, red awnings, and visible street vendors. Several people carrying umbrellas are walking throughout this midground pedestrian zone, some moving towards the viewer, others deeper into the background where more distant structures and trees are faintly visible under a dark sky.

In the subsequent frames, pedestrians in the midground continue their movement, with several individuals holding umbrellas visibly walking closer towards the viewer from the left and central parts of the pedestrian area. The parked grey SUV on the left and the yellow delivery scooter on the right remain stationary throughout the sequence.

The first frame displays a rainy nighttime street scene featuring a wet, reflective brick-patterned walkway extending towards a distant arched structure under a dark sky. Multi-story buildings with illuminated storefronts line both sides: blue neon lights adorn the left, while red awnings and glowing signs mark the right. Pedestrians holding umbrellas, including a woman with a white umbrella on the midground-left and another with a yellow umbrella on the midground-right, navigate the street, with a yellow scooter partially visible in the far right foreground.

Throughout subsequent frames, the camera remains stationary as continuous rainfall is evident. The initial pedestrians, like the woman with the white umbrella and the woman with the yellow umbrella, move past the viewer to the left and right respectively, while other individuals emerge from the background, walking towards or across the street in the midground and foreground.
