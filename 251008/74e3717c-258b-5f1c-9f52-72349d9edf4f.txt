The first frame presents a dusk street scene from a sidewalk viewpoint. A tree and partially visible silver car are to the immediate left, with parked cars lining the street and a red traffic light further down. On the right, brightly lit storefronts extend into the distance, featuring a "START AUTO DRIVING SCHOOL" sign and another eye-graphic sign overhead. Two people are visible on the mid-ground sidewalk: one standing and another, possibly leaning on a bicycle, near a lamppost.

In subsequent frames, the individual on the mid-ground sidewalk, initially leaning by the bicycle, slowly adjusts their clothing and then stands upright, remaining in the same general position relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a dusk street scene from a concrete sidewalk, looking down a city block. To the left are parked cars, a lamppost, and distant buildings, while on the right, brightly lit storefronts under an eye-shaped sign extend into the distance, with two people and a bicycle visible on the sidewalk in the mid-ground.

end of description

As the viewpoint subtly shifts forward and right, the lamppost on the left moves out of frame, revealing more of the adjacent sidewalk and the maroon car to the left. Concurrently, the storefronts on the right become more prominent, revealing an additional lighted display window closer to the viewer. The standing person on the mid-ground sidewalk bends further towards the person seated next to the bicycle.

The first frame captures a nighttime street view from a sidewalk. To the immediate left, a dark lamp post stands next to a line of parked cars along the curb, including a dark sedan and a blue SUV, with a bicycle leaned against a pole between them. Further left, an intersection with traffic lights and street signs is visible, and buildings extend into the distance. On the right, brightly lit storefronts with large display windows and a red awning stretch into the midground. In the center midground, two people are present: one stands near the bicycle, facing away, while another is seated or crouching beside it, facing the viewer.
end of description
Following this, the person initially standing on the sidewalk in the midground (near the bicycle) begins to walk towards the viewer. Simultaneously, the individual initially seated or crouching by the bicycle in the midground stands up and remains in that general area. By the final frame, the first person has walked significantly closer, now positioned just past the bicycle's original location, while the second person stands beside the bicycle.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a sidewalk view at dusk or night, with a brightly lit storefront featuring large display windows and a red awning immediately to the viewer's right. To the left, parked cars, a bicycle, and two individuals (one standing, one seated) line the curb, while the street extends into the distance with more vehicles, buildings, and streetlights visible.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly advances forward and right along the sidewalk. The standing individual on the left moves deeper into the scene, eventually exiting the frame, as the storefront displays on the right become more detailed due to the camera's slight progression.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a dusk street scene with a brightly lit storefront to the viewer's immediate right, and another glass-fronted store next to it. To the left, a blue car and bicycle are parked, and three people sit on a bench while a street with traffic and buildings extends into the background.
end of description
Following frames show the man in the light shirt, initially standing by the bench on the left, begin to walk forward, gradually approaching the viewer and moving towards the center of the sidewalk. The storefronts, parked vehicles, and other individuals largely remain in their first-frame positions relative to the viewer, with minimal background traffic changes.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a man in a light grey t-shirt and sweatpants walks towards the viewer on a sidewalk, positioned slightly left of center. To his immediate left, two individuals are seated on a bench next to a bicycle, and further down the street to the left, cars are stopped near traffic lights. On the viewer's right, a brightly lit storefront with large glass windows and a dark frame extends into the midground. The background reveals city buildings, some with illuminated signs, and a dark evening sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the man walks past the viewer, moving towards the left side of the frame and eventually exiting it by frame seven. Concurrently, the person seated on the bench to the viewer's left becomes more fully visible. Additionally, a pile of white bags appears on the sidewalk next to a green trash bin, to the left of the viewpoint, as they are no longer obscured by the walking man.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a person in dark pants and rollerblades is partially visible on the far lower left, next to two white garbage bags on the sidewalk. To their right stands a green cylindrical trash can. Further right, a street with multiple cars, a pedestrian crossing, and a traffic light pole are visible, extending into the midground. On the far right, a building exterior with large glass windows and dark frames fills the foreground, reflecting a circular object inside. In the midground, a pedestrian walks away from the viewer on the distant sidewalk, while buildings and a restaurant named "Istanbul" line the street in the background.
end of description
The person in rollerblades exits the frame to the left, and a new pedestrian walking towards the viewer appears on the far left street, eventually moving out of view to the left. Throughout the frames, vehicles continue to move away from the viewer on the street, and the distant pedestrian on the sidewalk continues their walk further away from the original viewpoint.
