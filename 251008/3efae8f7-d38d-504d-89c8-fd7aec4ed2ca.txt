In the first frame, a single railway track, comprising two rails on wooden sleepers over gravel ballast, extends from the foreground directly towards the viewer's center, receding into the far distance. To the left of the tracks, a dense forest line of green trees runs along the mid-ground and background, while to the right, a vast, flat green field stretches out, bordered by a distant treeline. Overhead, a clear blue sky with scattered white cumulus clouds is visible, along with overhead electrical wires and a single utility pole situated on the left side of the tracks in the mid-distance.

As the viewpoint moves forward along the railway, the foreground grass and the dense trees on the left rapidly move past the viewer. The utility pole initially visible in the mid-distance on the left approaches and then passes the viewer's immediate left, becoming a prominent object. Simultaneously, new sections of the railway track and the continuous green fields to the right are revealed further ahead, while another distant utility pole comes into view on the left side of the track.

The first frame depicts a train track stretching from the viewer's immediate foreground into the distant horizon, flanked by expansive green fields on both sides. A blue sky with scattered white clouds fills the upper half, while a dense forest line is visible on the distant left horizon. A dark utility pole with overhead wires is partially visible on the far left foreground, with another similar pole further down the tracks on the left and a small dark structure centered very far ahead.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the utility pole in the immediate foreground quickly moves out of view to the left. The second utility pole and its associated wires approach, pass by, and then recede to the left. Green fields and trackside vegetation continuously stream past the viewer. A small bush emerges and recedes on the left, followed by a white sign marked "77" that briefly appears on the far left before disappearing.
