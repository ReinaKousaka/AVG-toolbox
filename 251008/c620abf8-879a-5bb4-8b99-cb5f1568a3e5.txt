From an aerial perspective, towering white chalk cliffs, topped with lush green land, line the left and top-right of the frame, creating a cove in the center. A narrow grey pebble beach separates the cliffs from the dark turquoise sea, which occupies the middle-right and bottom-left, while a distinct, jagged white sea stack rises from the water in the bottom-right foreground.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily descends and shifts slightly forward and to the right. The prominent sea stack, initially in the bottom-right, grows significantly larger and moves towards the bottom-center of the frame as the camera approaches it. Concurrently, the cliffs on the far left recede further out of view, and the pebble beach and cliffs to the mid-right become more vertically centered within the expanding perspective.

The first frame features a prominent, light-colored sea stack in the right foreground, emerging from emerald green water. To the left and slightly behind it, a tall white cliff face extends from the mid-ground, with a dark, cave-like opening visible at its base in the water. A narrow, light-colored pebble beach stretches horizontally across the mid-ground, separating the main cliffs from the sea, and green grass caps the cliffs in the background.
end of description
Through the subsequent frames, the viewpoint slowly pulls back and pans left relative to the initial position. This dynamic change causes the foreground sea stack to appear to recede and become smaller, while revealing more of the continuous white cliff line and the curving pebble beach extending further to the left of the original scene.

In the first frame, a large, prominent white chalk sea stack stands in the turquoise-green water towards the center-right. To the viewer's left, a massive white chalk cliff extends from the mid-ground towards the foreground, with another smaller sea stack visible at its base further left. A long, curved pebble beach stretches along the base of the extensive white chalk cliffs that recede into the distance towards the upper right, with green vegetation visible atop the cliffs.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly pulls back and pans slightly to the left. This dynamic change gradually reveals more of the expansive white chalk cliffs and the shimmering turquoise water extending further to the left of the original view. Consequently, the prominent sea stack shifts slightly to the right within the frame, and a previously partially obscured smaller sea stack or rock formation on the far left becomes more fully visible.
