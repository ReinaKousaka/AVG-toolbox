The first frame depicts a rainy Times Square scene, with a person in a blue puffer jacket and grey hood visible from behind in the mid-ground left, holding a black umbrella. To their right, a grey square barrier marked 'TIMES SQUARE', a black SUV, and three colored trash bins are on the wet pavement, framed by towering buildings adorned with bright billboards.

As the frames progress, the person in the blue puffer jacket walks forward and slightly right, revealing a 'TIMES SQUARE ALLIANCE' barrier emerging on the far left. Simultaneously, the black SUV in the mid-ground right moves slowly forward, and the person standing near the 'TIMES SQUARE' barrier subtly shifts position.
