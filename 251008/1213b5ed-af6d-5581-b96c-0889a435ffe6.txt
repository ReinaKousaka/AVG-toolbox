The viewer stands on a snowy crosswalk in a city, facing a street intersection with several pedestrians waiting directly ahead. A Chick-fil-A in a brick building is to the right, beside a black car and a red pole. To the left, a red traffic light, "W 27 ST" sign, and a silver car down the street are visible, with tall buildings lining the thoroughfare in the distance as snow falls.
end of description
Following this, the traffic light to the viewer's left changes from red to green, causing the black car on the right and the silver car on the far left to move forward across the intersection. The pedestrians directly in front of the viewer mostly remain in position as snow continues to fall throughout the scene.

In the first frame, several pedestrians stand on a snowy crosswalk, their backs to the viewer, facing a city street lined with tall buildings under an overcast sky. A black car turns left in the midground, while a black sedan is stationary to the right of the crosswalk, next to a brick building featuring a red Chick-fil-A sign.
end of description
Subsequently, the black sedan to the right slowly inches forward, and the pedestrians directly in front of the viewer begin walking across the street. The overall scene transitions from stationary to movement, with consistent snowfall throughout.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
A street scene on a snowy day shows multiple pedestrians on a crosswalk, mostly with their backs to the viewer, moving away from the viewer towards the opposite side of the street. To the left, a green "W 37 St" sign marks the intersection, accompanied by traffic lights, while a brick building with a red "Chick-fil-A" sign and a stationary black sedan occupy the right side of the frame.
end of description
As the frames progress, the foreground pedestrians continue walking across the crosswalk away from the viewer. Notably, the street sign on the left side of the intersection dynamically changes from "W 37 St" to "W 27 St" and then reverts to "W 37 St." A new pedestrian in a green jacket also becomes more clearly visible in the mid-ground, walking towards the viewer from the street's far side.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, several pedestrians are visible on a crosswalk in a city street covered with some snow. In the foreground, a woman in a light coat and beanie is to the left, facing away, while two men in dark coats are centrally positioned, also facing away. To the center-right, a woman in a green jacket holding an orange bag walks towards the viewer, next to a man in a dark jacket facing the viewer, and another person partially obscured by a black car on the far right. On the mid-left, buildings line the street, featuring a green 'W 37 St' sign and traffic lights, while the mid-right reveals a brick building with 'Chick-fil-A' and 'LIQUOR' signs. Tall city buildings dominate the background under a gray sky.
end of description
Throughout the frames, the group of pedestrians initially facing away in the center and left foreground moves further across the street, away from the viewer's original position. Simultaneously, the woman in the green jacket and orange bag, originally at the center-right, continues walking towards and then passes the viewer, moving towards the right side of the scene. The man beside her and the person near the black car also progress forward, passing the viewer to the right. The black car itself, initially partially visible on the far right, remains largely stationary but slightly advances by the final frame.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a snowy city street scene with a crosswalk in the foreground, where multiple pedestrians, mostly with their backs to the viewer, are walking from left to right, including a person in a green hooded jacket prominent in the right-center. To the left, a dark car is driving away from the viewer on the wet street, while to the right, storefronts like Chick-fil-A are visible, with a green "W 37 ST" sign affixed to a traffic pole in the midground.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the pedestrians continue moving forward across the street and further right along the sidewalk, with the person in the green jacket progressively moving towards and then out of the frame to the right of the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the car on the far left drives further into the distance and eventually exits the frame to the left, revealing more of the wet street as the other pedestrians proceed further into the midground.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a snowy city street scene from a slightly elevated perspective behind a person in a black puffer jacket and a light beanie, who is positioned in the immediate foreground on the right. Ahead and slightly to the left, three individuals walk away from the viewer across a wet crosswalk and street. To the far left, a blue car drives away down the snow-dusted street, where a traffic light pole with street signs ("W 37 ST", "ONE WAY") stands. On the right, a row of urban buildings with shopfronts, including a "LIQUOR" sign and a "Chick-fil-A" window display, lines the sidewalk, while tall buildings recede into the overcast background.

end of description
The group of people in the midground continues walking further away from the viewer down the street. Simultaneously, snow begins to fall noticeably across the scene, with flakes visible descending towards the viewer. As the people progress, a blue mailbox becomes fully revealed on the left side of the street, to the left of the traffic pole. Later, a yellow taxi briefly appears on the street in the midground, behind the departing group, and another person in a grey coat becomes visible behind the initial walking figures.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a snowy urban street looking forward, with the back of a person in a white beanie and black puffer jacket occupying the immediate right foreground. A group of four pedestrians walks ahead on the right sidewalk, paralleling storefronts and tall buildings, while a wet street with a blue mailbox and green trash can lines the left side under a grey, snow-dusted sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint continuously moves forward, the initial foreground person recedes further along the right side of the frame, revealing more of the sidewalk that was once behind them. The group of four, initially in the mid-ground right, continues to move away from the viewer's original position, while the woman in the light brown coat, initially the last in that group, walks forward and slightly to the left, becoming more distinct in the left mid-ground relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The blue mailbox and green trash can, initially situated in the mid-ground left, are gradually passed and then appear to the left and slightly behind the first-frame viewpoint as the sequence concludes.
