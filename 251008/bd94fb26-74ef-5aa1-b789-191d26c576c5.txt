The first frame displays a rainy street scene with a white SUV driving towards the viewer in the center-midground on wet asphalt, marked with white arrows and an 'X'. Dark tree trunks and foliage line the left side, while a partially visible silver car is in the foreground right, adjacent to a black metal barrier. In the background, a low-rise commercial building with colorful storefronts stands before numerous tall apartment buildings, under an overcast sky, with a person holding a yellow umbrella visible crossing the street further back. end of description
The white SUV proceeds closer to the viewer from the center, then passes out of frame to the viewer's right. Concurrently, a black car emerges in the far left lane and moves towards the viewer, as an umbrella from above partially obscures the top of the frame. The black car continues into the midground from the left, and the person with the yellow umbrella moves to the distant background's right sidewalk.
