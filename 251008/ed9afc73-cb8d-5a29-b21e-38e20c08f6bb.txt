The first frame presents a winter scene with a snow-covered wooden mailbox unit, labeled "Chalet Nghoren," standing in the foreground, slightly left of center. Behind it and to the right, a multi-story wooden chalet is heavily blanketed in snow, featuring balconies, windows, and ground-level garage doors, with a blue flag visible on an upper balcony. A large, snow-laden evergreen tree occupies the left side of the frame, and the entire foreground and midground are covered in deep snow.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the camera slowly zooms out, causing the initial view of the mailbox, chalet, and tree to progressively shrink. This action dynamically reveals more of the surrounding snow-covered ground directly in front of and to the sides of the original scene, along with a slightly wider expanse of the wintry landscape extending further back from the chalet.
