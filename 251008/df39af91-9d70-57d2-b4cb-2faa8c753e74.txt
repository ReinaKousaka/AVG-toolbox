The first frame captures a charming cobblestone street lined with multi-colored half-timbered buildings under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left, a cafe area features stacked chairs, tables with potted plants, and a vibrant red umbrella, while a person on a bicycle, wearing a yellow floral shirt, is visible on the right side of the street, riding away from the viewer.

The cyclist in the yellow shirt continues to ride forward and away from the viewer down the street. Subsequently, a second person on a dark bicycle, wearing a white shirt, enters the frame from the right side, positioned closer to the viewer than the first cyclist, and also proceeds to ride forward into the distance.
