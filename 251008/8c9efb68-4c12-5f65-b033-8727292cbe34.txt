frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
In the first frame, a dirt path stretches directly ahead of the viewer, leading towards a distant coastal town, an ocean, and a prominent white lighthouse on the right horizon. A man in a red shirt runs directly ahead on the path, while a woman in a black shirt and pink shorts jogs to the immediate right and slightly behind the viewer. To the far left, a tall metal structure partially occupies the top-left corner, and various data overlays are present in the bottom corners and along the left edge.
end of description
As the frames progress, both the man and woman continue running forward along the dirt path, moving further away from the initial viewpoint. The man in red advances further into the midground, while the woman on the right maintains her relative position slightly behind and to the right of the viewer, exhibiting active running motion. The panoramic background, including the distant town, ocean, and the lighthouse on the right, remains spatially fixed relative to the first-frame viewpoint, showing no change in position. Concurrently, the on-screen data overlays continuously update to reflect the ongoing activity's pace, distance, and gradient changes.
