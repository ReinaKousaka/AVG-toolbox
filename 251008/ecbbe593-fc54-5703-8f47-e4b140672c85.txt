The first frame shows a bustling city sidewalk scene. In the immediate foreground, to the viewer's left, two men walk away from the viewer; one in a black polo and khaki shorts, and another in a floral shirt and denim shorts. Slightly further right, a woman in a black top and white pants walks towards the viewer, while a man in a navy polo and khaki shorts walks away from the viewer. To the viewer's far right, a silver newsstand with "Newsstand" written vertically is prominently positioned on the sidewalk. Beyond these foreground figures, a city street extends into the background with cars parked along the right side and tall buildings lining both sides.

Chronologically, the two men on the far left exit the frame to the left of the viewer, while the woman in white pants moves towards the left, stopping near the man in the navy polo. This man, initially walking away from the viewer, turns slightly towards the woman to his left, seemingly engaging in a conversation as they both remain on the sidewalk in the middle-left area relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Other pedestrians further down the street, beyond the newsstand, continue to move throughout the frames.

In the first frame, the viewer stands on a city sidewalk, with the back of a person in a dark shirt visible in the immediate left foreground and a woman partially seen beside them. To the right in the midground, a silver "Newsstand" stands, while a man in a striped shirt walks away on the left, near a reflective glass building. Further down the street, numerous pedestrians, parked cars, and tall buildings line the urban landscape.
end of description
As the scene unfolds, the immediate foreground figures move out of frame to the left. A new man in a light blue shirt then appears from the left, walking away from the viewer, and an easel sign becomes visible on the sidewalk to the left of the viewer, adjacent to the glass building, as the striped-shirt man and other pedestrians continue moving forward and left, deeper into the scene.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a city sidewalk scene with two women walking towards the viewer in the mid-ground. To the left is an easel-like sign and a building with reflective glass, while a corrugated metal structure is partially visible on the far right. Further down the street, pedestrians, parked cars, and tall buildings line the view.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the two women walk past the viewer, moving towards the bottom-left, progressively revealing more of the sidewalk and a light-colored car parked further down the street to the right of the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a woman in a light purple shirt and dark pants, holding a light-colored bag, is prominently positioned in the left foreground, walking towards the right and slightly away from the viewer. To her left is a glass-front building with "KEB Hana Bank USA" signage. The scene depicts a city sidewalk stretching into the distance on the left, lined with buildings and green foliage. On the right, a street runs parallel to the sidewalk, with several parked cars (a black SUV and a silver sedan) visible. Further down the sidewalk on the right, multiple pedestrians are visible, some standing and one person sitting near a small tree, with a black bicycle parked nearby.
end of description
The woman in the foreground continues walking past the viewer to the right, eventually exiting the frame as the camera subtly moves forward and pans right, revealing more of the left sidewalk and the KEB Hana Bank storefront. Concurrently, a person on an electric scooter emerges from the far background on the left sidewalk, moving past the midground pedestrians and parked cars. Other pedestrians in the midground continue to move, and a black bag becomes visible on the sidewalk near the bicycle on the right side of the frame.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a city street scene with a wide sidewalk, tall buildings lining both sides, and parked cars on the right. On the left, a KEB Hana Bank USA building with green planters is visible, while in the mid-ground, two pedestrians walk away from the viewer past a man with a bicycle and cart.
end of description
The two pedestrians continue walking further into the background, away from the viewer. Concurrently, another person in a dark dress emerges from behind the left building and also proceeds into the background, while the man with the bicycle remains mostly stationary.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
From the viewer's perspective on a sidewalk, a paved path extends forward with green foliage in planters on the far left. A black bicycle stands upright to the right of center, next to a tree with green leaves, and a man stands beside it holding a phone, with a black garbage bag on the ground to his right. In the midground, two people walk away from the viewer on the sidewalk, while a woman in a brown dress walks towards the viewer on the left; a black SUV is parked on the street to the right, and buildings line both sides of the distant street under an overcast sky, with other pedestrians scattered throughout the mid- and background.
end of description
The woman in the brown dress on the left walks towards the foreground, passing the viewer's original position. The two individuals ahead continue moving further away along the sidewalk. The man with the bicycle remains primarily stationary on the right. A person seated on a bench, initially partially obscured behind the man with the bicycle, becomes more clearly visible as the frames progress. Other distant pedestrians continue to move along the street and sidewalk.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a bustling city sidewalk. In the foreground, a woman in a dark patterned dress walks towards the viewer on the left, carrying a light brown handbag. To the right, a man in a black shirt leans over a black bicycle, which is parked next to a black utility crate. In the midground, two people walk away from the viewer on the sidewalk, with several other pedestrians visible further down the street. On the right, two men and a woman are seated on a low bench, with a small white dog resting nearby. The background features tall buildings lining both sides of the street, with parked and moving cars in the distance.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk. The woman initially in the left foreground moves past the viewer and out of frame to the left, while the man with the bicycle and the seated group on the right also exit the frame to the right. A 'DYLAN LEASING NOW' sign and a red fire hydrant are progressively revealed on the left side of the sidewalk, ahead of the initial viewpoint. Further down the street, a person on a red bicycle dynamically moves from right to left across the road, as new sections of the street and buildings appear ahead.
