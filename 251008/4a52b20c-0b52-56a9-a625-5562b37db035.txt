The first frame shows a multi-story stone building with numerous windows and a green fire escape on its left side positioned to the left of the viewer. A rocky riverbed with flowing water lies in the midground, running from the foreground towards the background, situated between the building on the left and a retaining wall on the right. To the viewer's right, a curved pedestrian walkway with a metal railing extends from the foreground into the background, running alongside the river. Behind this walkway, a tall stone retaining wall, partially covered with greenery and sparse red foliage, rises towards the right background, topped by dense trees. Overhanging tree branches with green leaves are visible at the top of the frame.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the scene remains largely static from the first-frame viewpoint, with no new objects or scenes revealed. The most notable dynamic change is the gentle swaying of the tree leaves and branches visible in the upper part of the frame, suggesting a light breeze. Additionally, the river's water continues to show movement and ripples, indicating its ongoing flow from the midground towards the background.
