The first frame reveals an expansive snow-covered ground in the foreground, with a watermark "deffel.film" visible at the bottom-left. In the midground, a dark line of bare deciduous trees and a few evergreen trees extends horizontally, partially obscuring a tall, multi-storied building in the background to the far left. A large, bare tree with drooping branches, partially covered in snow, frames the scene from the far right, while a bright sunburst peeks through the cloudy sky above.

Subsequent frames are nearly static, exhibiting only minute, subtle shifts in the clouds above the midground trees and the sun's light. There's a barely perceptible widening of the view, revealing a slightly increased area of the bare tree branches on the far right relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a serene winter landscape blanketed in snow. A large, bare-branched tree, partially covered with snow, dominates the right foreground, its expansive branches stretching across the upper right and mid-center. The lower half of the frame is a flat expanse of undisturbed snow, suggesting a frozen field or pond, leading to a treeline in the midground composed of various deciduous and evergreen trees. In the far left background, a tall, dark building is partially visible, while the sky above is overcast with a bright sunburst near the top-center.

The camera slowly pans to the right. The prominent tree in the first frame's right foreground moves further right across the view, revealing more of its trunk and branches. As it shifts, a new, smaller, snow-covered tree emerges behind and to the right of the main tree, entering the frame from the right. Simultaneously, the tall building previously in the far left background moves out of the frame to the left, while the entire midground treeline also shifts right, bringing more previously unseen trees into view from the right.
