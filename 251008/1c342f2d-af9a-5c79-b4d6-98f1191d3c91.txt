The first frame displays a long, textured wall covered with numerous old, torn posters, running horizontally across the midground. Vertical metal bars overlay the wall and posters. Above, a dark, ribbed ceiling extends across the top of the frame, meeting a light-colored floor that extends from the bottom of the wall towards the viewer. On the far right, a large poster of a smiling woman is prominent, with several other posters depicting figures to its left; the wall recedes into the distance towards the far left.
end of description
The camera slowly pans horizontally to the left, revealing new sections of the wall and additional posters that were initially positioned further left along the corridor from the first-frame viewpoint. As the view shifts, the poster of the smiling woman, initially on the far right, gradually moves out of frame to the right. Concurrently, more posters become visible, emerging from what was initially beyond the left edge of the first frame and moving towards the center. The pan continues to unveil the wall's extent further left of the original scene.

The first frame displays a long, metallic grated wall stretching from the lower left to the upper right, behind which numerous old, torn, and distressed posters are affixed. A prominent central poster depicts a samurai-like figure standing over a fallen person, flanked by other aged movie posters featuring Japanese characters and text. A slatted ceiling runs across the top of the frame, while a darker vertical panel with a rainbow-marked sign is visible to the far left.
end of description
The camera subtly zooms in and pans slightly to the left. This movement progressively reveals more vertical Japanese text on the prominent central movie poster. As the view shifts, the posters to the left of the initial viewpoint become slightly more central and clearer, while those on the far right of the original frame gradually move out of view.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a long, somewhat grimy corridor with a wall on the left covered in old, tattered Japanese movie posters, adhering to metallic grid paneling. A prominent poster on the far right depicts a samurai standing over a fallen figure, while another central poster features a smiling man holding a weapon surrounded by other characters. A white rectangular sign with a rainbow graphic is visible on a dark vertical panel to the left of the central posters, and a slatted metallic ceiling spans above.
end of description
The camera slowly pans left, revealing more of the graffiti-laden wall and additional weathered posters to the left of the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the posters originally on the far right of the frame gradually move out of view. The rainbow sign shifts from the left-center towards the center of the frame as the perspective changes.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a long, ribbed gray ceiling above a textured wall, both extending from the foreground into the distance. The wall is covered with numerous faded, torn posters, depicting various figures and Japanese text, predominantly on the left and right sides of the frame. Centrally positioned on the wall, a dark vertical panel features a white poster with a rainbow graphic and Japanese text. Below the posters, near the bottom of the wall, faint blue graffiti is visible, and the very bottom shows a dark floor.
end of description
A new rectangular plaque, initially partially obscured behind the white rainbow poster, begins to slide leftwards along the wall. As it moves, more of its surface and engraved text, including "YURAKU CONCOURSE," become visible to the immediate left of the rainbow poster and above the older torn posters. This movement continues across the subsequent frames until the plaque is fully revealed in its new position.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a narrow corridor or concourse with a weathered wall running along the viewer's left, adorned with several old, torn posters featuring various illustrations and Japanese text. Towards the right side of this wall, a metallic plaque is visible, inscribed with "YURAKU CONCOURSE" and Japanese characters, positioned above another large, tattered poster. Further to the far right, a dark vertical door or panel displays a white sign with a rainbow graphic and Japanese text related to COVID-19 precautions, while a slatted ceiling extends above and a plain floor below, both receding forward.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the camera subtly pans to the right relative to the initial viewpoint. This gradual movement reveals a slightly wider section of the dark panel and the COVID-19 sign on its far right edge, which were previously partially obscured. Concurrently, the leftmost posters on the wall progressively move out of the frame's left boundary. No new objects or scenes are revealed from behind or inside other elements; the existing scene is merely reframed by the subtle camera shift.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a long, textured wall directly in front of the viewer, covered with a series of old, tattered posters displaying Japanese text and illustrations. Above this wall, a ceiling with horizontal slats extends, and below, a concrete floor slopes slightly downwards. A metal plaque with Japanese text is partially visible on the far right.
end of description
No dynamic changes or newly revealed objects are observed in the subsequent frames; all frames are identical to the first.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a long, weathered wall extending from the left foreground towards the right background, adorned with several old, torn posters featuring Japanese characters and various illustrations. Above the posters, a horizontal metallic, ridged panel is visible, while below them, a dark, vertically textured wall segment rests above a dark, plain floor at the bottom left.

No dynamic changes or newly revealed objects or scenes occur in the subsequent frames; all frames are identical to the first.
