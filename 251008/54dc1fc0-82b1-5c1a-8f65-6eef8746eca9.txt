frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame presents a wet city street at night, with a prominent light-colored pole occupying the foreground-center. To its right is a storefront with large windows revealing wooden displays inside, while to its left, parked cars line the curb in front of tall, illuminated buildings, with a pedestrian walking away in the mid-distance on the sidewalk.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward and slightly right, the foreground pole exits the frame to the left, fully revealing a black 'A-frame' sign and more of the street that were previously partially obscured behind the pole to the bottom-left. Simultaneously, new sections of the sidewalk and the base of the storefront building become visible to the immediate right of the previously seen storefront, as all existing street objects appear to recede into the distance.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame captures a nighttime city street with a wet surface, showing tall buildings lining the left and a large reflective storefront window dominating the right. A white car is parked to the left, beyond which a man in a blue shirt walks along the sidewalk towards the viewer, surrounded by other parked cars and distant city lights.
end of description
Subsequently, the man continues walking closer to the viewer along the sidewalk. Simultaneously, the camera subtly advances forward, causing the storefront on the right to reveal more of its interior and further details of the street ahead of the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a wet city street at night, looking down a narrow thoroughfare. A man in a blue shirt and dark pants walks towards the viewer on the wet sidewalk, slightly left of center. To the viewer's left, a white car is parked, followed by a red SUV and other vehicles, alongside tall buildings with numerous illuminated windows and streetlights. To the viewer's right, a building with large, reflective storefront windows runs parallel to the sidewalk.
end of description
The man continues walking directly towards the viewer from the mid-ground, gradually becoming larger in the frame. He then walks past the viewer to the left, moving into the immediate foreground and eventually exiting the frame entirely to the viewer's left, while the street and buildings remain stationary.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A wet city street at night is visible, with a white car's rear in the foreground to the left. A red SUV and other parked cars line the left side of the street, stretching into the distance alongside tall buildings with illuminated windows. On the right, a sidewalk borders storefronts with reflective windows, one prominently featuring a light purple/pink hand graphic; the street recedes into the dim background under a dark sky.
end of description
The light purple/pink hand graphic on the mid-right storefront window slowly slides across the glass towards the viewer's right. As it moves, the text "in good friends" becomes newly visible to its left on the window, expanding the view of the storefront's display. The hand graphic then gradually disappears entirely from the frame to the far right, revealing more stacked boxes inside the store through the now unobstructed window.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a nighttime street view, with a dark red SUV parked closely to the viewer's left on a wet street. To the right, a building features large glass storefronts reflecting streetlights and showing stacked boxes inside, while illuminated multi-story buildings line both sides of the street extending into the dark background.
end of description
Subsequent frames show the viewpoint moving forward, causing the red SUV to gradually disappear from the left and revealing more parked cars behind it, previously obscured by the SUV from the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, new storefronts with "ZARA" and "Aesop" signs emerge and become prominent on the right as the viewer advances further down the wet street.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a wet city street at night, looking forward along a sidewalk. To the immediate left, a dark red car and a black car are parked, with a line of buildings featuring illuminated windows extending behind them. To the right, a building displays an "Aesop" storefront with visible boxes, while the reflective wet pavement stretches directly ahead into the dimly lit urban distance.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly progresses forward along the sidewalk. As the camera moves, the red and black cars on the left gradually exit the frame, and the "Aesop" storefront on the right becomes more prominent before receding slightly as the viewer continues forward down the street.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a rainy city street at night. Immediately to the viewer's left is the rear of a dark, wet car, while further along the left street margin, a row of parked vehicles lines the base of tall, illuminated multi-story buildings. The wet pavement extends directly ahead of the viewer, reflecting distant lights and leading to a white SUV parked on the left, adjacent to some white trash bags on the sidewalk. To the viewer's immediate right, a building with large, reflective storefront windows reveals an empty, lit interior, with "HANA TRADING" signage visible on an adjacent building further down. The dark night sky crowns the scene above the distant city buildings.
end of description
Across the subsequent frames, a very subtle camera movement shifts the perspective slightly. The parked cars and buildings on the left side of the first frame gradually appear to move further to the viewer's left. Simultaneously, the view ahead and to the right of the first-frame viewpoint becomes slightly more encompassing, revealing marginal new details of the street and buildings previously just outside the initial right edge of the frame, indicating a slight pan to the right.
