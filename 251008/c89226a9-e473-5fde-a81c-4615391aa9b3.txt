The first frame displays a snowy winter street scene with a multi-story building featuring balconies on the left, next to a snow-covered sidewalk. A large white bus occupies the right foreground, its reflective side mirroring the building opposite and trees. A dark asphalt road extends into the distance, leading to a white car and snow-dusted conifer trees against a pale sky.

As the frames progress, the white bus on the right moves forward and away from the viewer, gradually revealing more of the snowy bank and trees that were initially obscured behind it. The bus's side also becomes clearer, eventually displaying "CHAMONIX BUS" text and a yellow warning sticker. By the final frames, the bus has entirely exited to the front right, revealing a fully visible road sign on the right marking a turnoff, further down the road from the initial viewpoint.

The first frame displays a winter road scene with a dark, wet asphalt road receding into the distance, flanked by snow-covered ground. To the left, a multi-story white building with wooden balconies stands prominently, followed by a second house partially obscured by a snow-covered hedge and a bare tree. On the right, a dense forest of snow-laden evergreen trees lines the road, extending towards snow-capped mountains in the background, where a white car is also visible parked on the left.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the prominent white building on the left recedes and moves out of view, revealing more of the adjacent houses. The parked white car on the left side of the road draws closer, and a small utility box and a signpost become visible further along the sidewalk to the left. Simultaneously, the snow-covered forest on the right approaches, making a 'no entry' sign, initially on the far right, more discernible.

The first frame displays a snowy winter landscape with a dark asphalt road extending forward from the viewer. To the left, a white SUV is parked alongside a snow-covered hedge, behind which are several houses and a bare tree; snow-capped mountains are visible in the far background. To the right, a dense forest of snow-laden evergreen trees lines a snow-covered bank. In the mid-distance down the road, a yellow building and other vehicles are discernable.
end of description
The white SUV, initially parked on the left in the mid-ground, begins to drive forward, away from the viewer. Its movement progressively reveals more of the snow-covered hedge and houses that were previously obscured behind it on the left side of the road. As the SUV travels further into the distance, a dark sedan becomes clearly visible ahead on the road, near the yellow building.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a wet, dark road stretching forward through a snowy mountain village. To the left, a white car drives past yellow buildings, snow-covered terrain, a tall banner pole, and distant snow-capped mountains. On the right, a dense, snow-laden forest borders the road, with a 30 km/h speed limit sign visible ahead and to the right.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the white car passes out of sight to the left, revealing a white van parked further down the left side of the road. The banner on the left becomes fully visible, displaying "HAUS SATIS", while the snowy forested mountains continue to flank the path.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a snowy mountain road scene with a dark road leading away from the viewer, flanked by snow-covered ground and trees on the right. To the left, a light yellow building with brown shutters stands alongside the road, with snow-capped mountains in the distant background. A white van is positioned on the left side of the road, ahead of the yellow building, and a black digital sign with yellow text is further down the road on the right.
end of description
A white van, initially in front and to the left of the viewer, begins to move forward, getting closer and then passing by on the left side of the road. Concurrently, the text on the black digital sign, located on the right side of the road further from the viewer, changes its display.
