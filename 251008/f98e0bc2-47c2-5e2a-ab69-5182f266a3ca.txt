The first frame shows a wet, dark city street at night. A wide sidewalk, partially covered in a yellow tactile paving strip, occupies the right foreground and mid-ground. To the left of the sidewalk, a black electric scooter is parked near a low, angled concrete planter or bench, with a row of bare trees beyond it, stretching into the distance. On the far left, a wet street reflects colorful city lights, and multiple illuminated bus stops line the opposite side. Further down the street, a green traffic light is visible, with city buildings and a large, ornate structure illuminated in the far background.

Starting from the second frame, a glowing white arrow progressively appears on the wet street surface to the right of the central reflective area, gradually forming from its outline. This arrow brightens and solidifies over successive frames, becoming fully defined by frame seven, pointing forward into the distant background.

The first frame shows a wet city street at night, reflecting numerous colorful lights from streetlamps, traffic signals (a prominent green light in the mid-distance), and distant buildings. Bare trees line the left side of the street, behind which illuminated bus shelters are visible, while a raised curb/median runs diagonally from the bottom-left towards the center. On the right, a dark sidewalk or road portion leads to a traditional-style building with an ornate roof and visible interior lights in the midground.

Throughout the subsequent frames, small, white objects resembling electric scooters progressively appear and accumulate on the median to the left of the viewer, extending closer from the midground towards the foreground. Concurrently, visible streaks of rain become more defined, particularly around the streetlights, underscoring the continuous rainfall.

The first frame displays a rain-slicked city street at night, viewed from a low angle on the sidewalk. To the immediate left, multiple electric scooters are parked near a tree trunk, with bus shelters visible further down the street. A wet asphalt road, marked with a yellow tactile paving strip, extends into the distance, flanked by bare trees and streetlights on both sides. In the mid-ground right, a traditional building structure is partially visible behind a tree, while distant city lights illuminate the dark sky, and a traffic light glows yellow.
end of description
As frames progress, the traffic light in the mid-distance on the right side of the road dynamically changes from yellow to red. A long, yellow banner with Korean text appears, stretched across two trees in the middle ground, slightly left of the road's center. A white bus briefly moves from left to right behind the bus stops on the left, and distant vehicle lights, including red taillights and headlights, become visible traveling away from the viewer on the wet road. Faint figures of people can also be observed moving in the far background.
