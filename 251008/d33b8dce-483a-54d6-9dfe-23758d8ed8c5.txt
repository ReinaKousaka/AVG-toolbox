The first frame depicts a stone-paved area leading to central stone steps, behind which a low stone wall with a red gate and two large statues fronts an ornate traditional building flanked by trees and smaller pavilions; a wooden sign stands to the left, and two people with a broom are positioned on the far right.

Across subsequent frames, the two people on the right side of the viewpoint progressively move leftward across the midground. The child, holding a broom, appears to be sweeping as they advance. They slowly pass the green pole and move closer to the central fence, with the child eventually becoming partially obscured behind the adult. By the final frame, the adult is positioned near the right side of the central fence, with the child largely out of view behind them.

The first frame displays a stone pathway leading to steps in the foreground, with a red information sign on the left. Centrally, a raised stone platform featuring a red wooden fence and four dark statues is flanked by large trees, behind which a prominent traditional Chinese building with a green tiled roof is visible, along with two smaller structures, all set against a backdrop of distant mountains.

No new objects or scenes are revealed; the only dynamic change observed across the following frames is the subtle swaying of the green foliage on the trees, especially the one to the far left.

In the first frame, a set of stone steps occupies the immediate foreground, leading up to a low stone wall topped by a red wooden fence, all centrally located. Four dark statues, two on each side, stand behind the wall and fence; the outer pair are larger armored figures, while the inner pair are smaller. To the far left, a red signpost with a board is visible, and lush green trees frame the scene on both sides. In the mid-ground, a central ornate temple-like building with a distinctive blue-tiled roof and intricate colorful details stands elevated, flanked by two smaller similar structures partially obscured by trees. Distant green mountains and a cloudy sky complete the background.

The subsequent frames depict a continuous, slow zoom-in towards the temple complex from the first-frame viewpoint. The foreground steps gradually recede, eventually disappearing from the bottom of the frame. Concurrently, the red wooden fence, the four statues, and the central temple building with its flanking structures progressively increase in size, appearing closer and revealing more detail. No new objects or scenes are revealed; rather, the existing elements become more prominent within the frame.
