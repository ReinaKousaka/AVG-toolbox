In the first frame, a wet city street at night is visible, reflecting the ambient lights. To the viewer's immediate lower left, part of a white car is seen, with another white car (taxi) further back on the left side of the street. A silver sedan is parked parallel to the curb in the midground, slightly right of center. On the right, a sidewalk features a tree, a trash bin, and a building with various illuminated signs and a red awning; a person is partially visible near the building's entrance on the far right.

The white car in the immediate foreground, to the viewer's lower left, begins to move forward and gradually exits the frame to the left, revealing more of the wet street. Simultaneously, the person standing on the far right sidewalk, near the red awning, moves further into the building's entrance. This person then completely disappears from view as the foreground car continues to move and eventually exits the frame.

The first frame depicts a rainy city street at night, with a partial white car in the foreground left and a silver sedan parked mid-ground center, rear facing the viewer. To the right, a tree trunk stands beside two orange-lidded trash cans and a tall advertising banner on the sidewalk. Beyond the wet street, buildings with illuminated signs line both sides into the background, revealing other distant vehicles.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the partial white car on the foreground left proceeds forward, moving away from the viewer and further left into the scene. All other main objects like the silver sedan, tree, and buildings remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint, as the rain continues consistently throughout the scene.
