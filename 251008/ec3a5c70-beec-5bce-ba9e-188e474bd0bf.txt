In the first frame, a wet city street is viewed from a low perspective. On the immediate left, a dark SUV is partially visible, followed by a silver sedan and a light gray SUV parked along the curb. In the midground, a person holding a red umbrella walks towards the viewer on the left side of the road, while a silver sedan with illuminated taillights moves away from the viewer on the right, driving on the wet asphalt marked by a yellow lane line. Further down the right side, more cars are parked, and both sides of the street are lined with commercial buildings under an overcast sky, leading to an intersection in the distance.

The silver sedan in the midground right continues to move away from the viewer, its red taillights gradually receding into the distance. Concurrently, the person with the red umbrella on the left side of the street walks closer to the viewer, becoming slightly more prominent. All other parked vehicles on both the left and right sides of the road remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a wet city street, reflecting light, with a double yellow line visible on the right. In the foreground, two cars (silver and white) are parked on the left, facing away from the viewer. Lines of parked cars extend down both sides of the street into the midground, flanked by tall city buildings. A person with a pink umbrella is walking away from the viewer in the midground, on the left side of the road. A red sign with Korean text is mounted on a building on the left, further down the street.

The person with the pink umbrella continues walking further away from the viewer, deeper into the background. Simultaneously, a second person holding a dark umbrella emerges from behind the parked cars on the right side of the road, also moving away from the viewer in the midground. The white van parked on the left also appears to move slightly further away, towards the background.

In the foreground, the front left portion of a white car is visible on the left, adjacent to a wet asphalt road reflecting the ambient light, with a yellow double line running along its right side. On the left midground, a white Kia Picanto is parked facing away from the viewer, with a red sign displaying Korean text "국가검사 자동차" further back. In the center midground, a person holding a bright pink umbrella walks away from the viewer down the street, followed closely by another person. Along the right midground, several cars are parked, including a dark sedan closest to the viewer and a silver sedan behind it. Buildings line both sides of the street, extending into the background under a bright, overcast sky.
end of description
The two individuals walking in the middle of the wet street, one with a pink umbrella and the other behind them, consistently move further into the distance away from the viewer. They progressively advance deeper into the background of the scene with each subsequent frame.
