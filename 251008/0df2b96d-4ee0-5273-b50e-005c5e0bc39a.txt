The first frame shows a person walking away from the viewer on a wet brick sidewalk to the left, holding a black and red umbrella. To the immediate right, a tree trunk with black supports and a tall street lamp post stand, behind which a wet asphalt road with white arrow markings extends into the distance. A colorful horizontally striped wall borders the sidewalk on the far left, while the background reveals distant city buildings, trees, and a traffic light on the right, all under heavy rain.

The person with the umbrella consistently walks further away along the sidewalk. A black car with active headlights then emerges from the right side of the wet road, moving towards the background. This is followed by a blue truck traveling in the same direction, also passing away from the viewer on the road. Finally, a silver car appears from the right and proceeds towards the background, splashing water as it drives through the heavy rain.

In the first frame, a gray utility pole with white floral patterns stands prominently on the far right. To its left, a wet brick sidewalk extends into the background, flanked on the left by a horizontally striped wall (pink, white, green, etc.) and on the right by a row of trees. A person holding a black umbrella with a red underside walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk. To the right of the trees, a wet street has a silver taxi moving from right to left in the mid-ground. Distant city buildings are visible in the background, obscured by rain.

The person with the umbrella walks further away from the viewer down the sidewalk. On the street, the silver taxi proceeds past, followed by a gray car moving left. Subsequently, a black SUV and then another silver car drive by from right to left, while the rain continues to fall. Finally, a motorcycle also travels from right to left on the wet street.

The first frame captures a rainy street scene with a wet sidewalk running diagonally from the bottom-left foreground towards the mid-ground. To the immediate left, a colorful corrugated construction barrier extends along the sidewalk, while further along the sidewalk, a person holding a black umbrella with a red underside walks away from the viewer. A row of trees lines the right side of the sidewalk, beyond which a wet street shows a person on a red scooter with an orange box moving away from the viewer on the far right. In the background, buildings are faintly visible through the rain.
end of description
Following frames show the person with the umbrella continuing to walk further away on the sidewalk. The scooter also proceeds further down the street away from the viewer. Subsequently, a black car with illuminated headlights appears in the mid-ground on the street to the right of the trees, moving across the frame and exiting to the right. Finally, a white car emerges from the mid-ground on the street, following the path of the black car and also passing out of view to the right.
