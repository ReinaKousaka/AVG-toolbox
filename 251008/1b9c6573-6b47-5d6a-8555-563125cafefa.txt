A wet, paved path stretches from the foreground towards the background, curving slightly right, bordered by lush green bushes on both sides. Tall trees with verdant foliage line the path, leading into a misty, green background. In the mid-ground, a person holding a dark umbrella walks away from the viewer along the path.
end of description
The person with the dark umbrella, initially moving away, turns and walks towards the viewer along the path, gradually growing larger in the frame. They wear a blue top, dark pants, and a white face mask, also carrying a black shoulder bag on their left side. The individual continues to approach, passing the trees and bushes, moving into the foreground while maintaining their walk towards the viewer.
