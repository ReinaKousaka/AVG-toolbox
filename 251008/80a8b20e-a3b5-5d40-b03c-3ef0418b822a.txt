An orange car is visible in the bottom left foreground, while a wet street with dirty snow and pedestrians crossing it occupies the midground. Behind them, a large, illuminated "CANADA PLACE" building stands with a "PUBLIC PARKING" sign and ramp prominently featured on its right.

Throughout subsequent frames, the viewpoint slightly widens, revealing more of the street and the left side of the Canada Place building. Pedestrians continue their movement across the street, and a silver car enters from the far left, proceeding rightward across the midground.

The first frame displays a nighttime exterior scene of Canada Place, a large white building with "CANADA PLACE" signage and a distinctive glass canopy entrance on the left. In the midground, a silver sedan is positioned towards the center, appearing to turn right and away from the viewer, while a group of pedestrians crosses a wet street from right to left, moving away from the viewer, in front of an illuminated 'PUBLIC PARKING' sign located to the right. Several other vehicles are visible near the building's entrance in the background left.
end of description
The silver sedan in the midground slowly moves forward and slightly to the right, continuing away from the viewer. Concurrently, the group of pedestrians on the crosswalk progresses further to the left, with some individuals completing their crossing and moving out of the frame. A new vehicle with bright headlights becomes more visible as it approaches from the far left of the scene in the background.

A night scene depicts a large white building identified as "CANADA PLACE" on the right, illuminated by many lights and a lit canopy over its entrance, with various people gathered near its entrance. In the foreground, a silver sedan sits on a wet street, angled slightly left, while a group of people begins to cross a crosswalk from the right side of the viewer towards the left. A bright streetlight is visible on the far left, illuminating the curving road and distant buildings under a dark sky.
end of description
The silver sedan in the foreground slowly advances forward and slightly to the left. Simultaneously, the group of people on the crosswalk continues their movement towards the left side of the frame, progressing further away from the viewer and across the street. Vehicles with headlights, positioned further down the street to the far left, also advance forward into the distance.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A nighttime urban street scene depicts a wet asphalt road curving from the immediate foreground towards the left, illuminated by glowing yellow streetlights on the left, with a dark car parked there. To the right, a prominent multi-story building with a grand glass-covered entrance canopy stands, where a silver sedan is situated mid-frame, partially on a crosswalk where numerous pedestrians are actively moving from right to left. Several other vehicles are visible near the building's entrance, and distant buildings with illuminated windows are seen in the background on the left.
end of description
The silver sedan in the midground subtly shifts its front wheels as the pedestrians on the crosswalk consistently advance, gradually clearing the right side of the crosswalk. The sedan continues to inch forward over the frames, eventually moving its front wheels entirely off the crosswalk. Towards the final frames, a dark vertical structure emerges into the frame from the far right, partially obscuring the building and the remaining pedestrians on that side.
