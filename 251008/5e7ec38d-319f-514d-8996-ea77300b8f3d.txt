In the first frame, a stone railing with an animal sculpture on its post occupies the immediate foreground left, extending towards the viewer. A wide, wet stone-paved path stretches from the midground towards a large, multi-tiered traditional gatehouse with flanking buildings directly ahead in the background, under an overcast sky. Three individuals in colorful Hanbok, holding umbrellas, walk on the path in the midground, approaching the viewer from near the gatehouse. To the left of the path, the ground is muddy and wet with some sparse grass.

Progressively, the three individuals continue walking forward along the path, drawing closer to the first-frame viewpoint and shifting slightly towards the center. As they advance, the stone railing on the far left gradually recedes from view, and the muddy area to the left of the path becomes less visible, indicating a slight forward movement of the observation point relative to the initial frame.

In the first frame, a wet, wide stone pathway extends from the bottom center towards a large, traditional Korean palace gate in the background, flanked by low-rise buildings. On this path, three individuals in Hanbok and masks walk towards the viewer, holding umbrellas: a person in purple on the left with a grey umbrella, a person in beige in the middle with a rainbow umbrella, and a person in pink on the right with a black umbrella. The sky is overcast and cloudy.
end of description
The three individuals continue walking directly towards the viewer on the path, steadily increasing in size. As they approach, the person in purple moves further left relative to the viewer, eventually moving partially out of the frame. The person in pink, previously on the right, moves closer towards the viewer's left foreground, passing in front of the beige-clad individual. The beige-clad person, now holding a light blue umbrella, follows slightly behind and to the right of the pink-clad individual, still on the main pathway towards the viewer.

In the first frame, a person wearing a light blue hanbok and a black mask, holding a light blue umbrella and a small black bag, is visible in the foreground to the viewer's left. A wide, wet stone path stretches from the foreground towards a large, traditional Korean gate with a dark, multi-tiered roof in the midground, flanked by long, low traditional buildings extending horizontally to its left and right. Further down the path, in the midground, two smaller figures holding red umbrellas are seen approaching the central gate under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the person with the light blue umbrella moves out of the frame to the viewer's immediate left. The viewpoint subtly tracks forward, revealing more of the wet stone pathway directly ahead, while the traditional gate and connecting buildings in the distance remain centered. The two people holding red umbrellas, previously visible further down the path, continue their slow walk towards the main gate.
