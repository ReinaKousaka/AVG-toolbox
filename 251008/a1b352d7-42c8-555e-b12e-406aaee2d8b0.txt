The first frame shows a rainy city street from a ground-level perspective, with a wet sidewalk on the left lined by black barriers and a building featuring an illuminated marquee and posters. To the right, a wet street holds a black car parked closest to the viewer, a white car behind it, and a red lane, while pedestrians with umbrellas walk away in the midground and city buildings rise in the distance.

All subsequent frames are static, revealing no dynamic changes in object movement, spatial positions, or newly uncovered scenes relative to the initial viewpoint.

The first frame displays a rainy city street from a low vantage point. To the viewer's left, a building with a large, brightly lit awning extends forward, featuring multiple vertical illuminated displays below, bordered by a black metal barrier. A wet sidewalk stretches into the mid-ground, where several pedestrians, some holding umbrellas, walk away from the viewer. To the right, a wet street with a red-painted lane has several cars, including a prominent black one in the foreground, either stopped or slowly moving in the rain, while tall buildings recede into the overcast distance. "Subscribe." text is visible in the bottom-left corner.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, the rainy conditions persist, creating shimmering reflections on the wet sidewalk and street. Pedestrians on the left side of the sidewalk continuously move forward, away from the viewer. Concurrently, vehicles on the street to the right also progress forward, with the black car closest to the viewer driving off, and others slowly advancing into the distance. The dynamic activity within the urban environment continues under the steady rain without introducing new elements or scenes.

The first frame displays a wet city street scene, with a brightly lit canopy extending over the left side of a wide, wet sidewalk in the midground. In the foreground, a black car is parked closest to the viewer on the right, with a white car behind it, both on the wet street; the bottom left features the text "Subscribe.". Several people carrying umbrellas are visible on the sidewalk in the midground, walking away from the viewer and towards the left side of the frame, alongside metal barriers. Beyond the canopy, tall buildings line the street on both sides, with traffic visible in the rainy midground and background.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the group of people continues walking along the wet sidewalk from the midground towards the foreground-left. As they advance, their umbrellas visibly react to the weather, with one transparent umbrella flipping inside out near the foreground-left. Simultaneously, vehicles on the street to the right of the sidewalk show continuous, subtle movement.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a wet city street scene unfolds under a large, illuminated awning extending overhead on the left. Three people with umbrellas walk away from the viewer on the left sidewalk: a woman with a black umbrella and a red bag, a man with a light umbrella behind her, and a woman with a patterned umbrella further right. To the right of the sidewalk, a dark car is partially visible, followed by a white sedan parked along the street, which is bustling with traffic and flanked by tall buildings. A metal barrier runs along the left side of the sidewalk, and "Subscribe." text is visible in the bottom-left corner.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the three individuals on the left side of the wet sidewalk continue walking away from the viewer, progressively moving deeper into the scene and eventually exiting the frame to the left. The woman with the black umbrella is the first to move out of view, followed by the man and then the woman with the patterned umbrella. All other elements, including the parked cars, buildings, and general street scene, remain static relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a wet city sidewalk under a dark overhead awning, with "Subscribe." text in the bottom left. To the left, black metal barriers line a building showing red reflections, while a tree in a wooden guard and a trash can are centrally positioned. A white car is parked on the wet street to the right, next to a partially visible dark car, with a busy street of vehicles and tall buildings extending into the rainy background. end of description. In subsequent frames, the white car slowly drives forward and slightly to the right, moving away from the viewer. This action progressively reveals more of the street and the full front of the dark car previously obscured to its right, as the heavy rain persists.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a wet city street and sidewalk on a rainy day, with glistening reflections across the ground. To the viewer's left, a building with reflective windows and a black metal barrier stretches into the mid-distance where a partially visible "NEW YOR" sign glows. On the right, a white car is parked next to a green trash can and a wooden tree guard, with more vehicles visible further down the street.
end of description
In the following frames, the white car on the right slowly moves forward and away from the viewer, gradually revealing more of the wet street and parked vehicles previously obscured behind it. Other cars in the distance also show slight movements forward relative to the viewer, as rain continuously falls over the entire urban scene.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a rainy city street scene from a low-angle viewpoint on a wet sidewalk. To the viewer's immediate left is a black metal barrier, beyond which a tall building with a light-colored facade and large windows extends into the distance. On the viewer's right, a wooden planter structure encloses a small tree, beside which stands a gray parking meter post and a green trash can. Further to the right of the meter, a wet street with moving cars and their reflections stretches away from the viewer. In the mid-ground, the sidewalk leads towards distant buildings under an overcast sky, with a partial "NEW YORK" sign visible on a building on the left. The text "Subscribe." is present at the bottom left.
end of description
The camera slowly pans right, causing the black metal barrier on the viewer's immediate left to move progressively out of the frame. Simultaneously, the wooden planter and parking meter on the viewer's right shift further right, revealing more of the wet street and additional vehicles that were previously to the right of the first frame's viewpoint. Cars on the street, initially to the viewer's right and moving away, continue their progression. The visible intensity of the rain and its reflections on the street and sidewalk remain consistent.
