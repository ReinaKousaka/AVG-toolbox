As the viewpoint moves forward, the man in the foreground exits the frame to the right. A black bin with white graffiti is newly revealed on the right side of the sidewalk, slightly closer than the vehicles. The pedestrians under the scaffolding continue moving away from the viewer, and the man in the black jacket previously partially obscured on the far left becomes more fully visible, while more of the street and buildings further down the block are revealed ahead.

The first frame shows a pedestrian's eye view walking down a covered urban sidewalk. To the viewer's immediate left is a dark storefront with "ARMANI EXCH" visible, bordered by white arched scaffolding supports that extend into the distance. Several pedestrians are walking away from the viewer along the sidewalk; a man in a light jacket is on the far left, and a woman with a beige backpack is centrally located, both moving away. To the viewer's right, beyond the scaffolding, is a street with parked cars, including a white minivan with its trunk open, and taller buildings further in the background.

The viewer slowly progresses forward along the covered sidewalk, causing the initial pedestrians to move further into the distance relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, new individuals emerge from behind the initial viewpoint on the left, including a person in a dark hoodie and another pushing a shopping trolley. Vehicles on the street to the right of the viewer's path continue to be visible, with some, like the white minivan, remaining relatively stationary while others further down the street move past. The buildings on the far right remain in the background, subtly shifting as the viewpoint advances.
