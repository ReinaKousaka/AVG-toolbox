The first frame depicts a narrow street scene. To the immediate left, a dark grey pole stands in front of a white compact car, partially obscured by green and light grey foliage. Behind the car is a yellow building with a closed brown shutter. Centered in the midground is a dark, arched passageway with a cobblestone path, revealing a glimpse of a more distant, narrower passage with reddish details. To the right, a stone wall features a green and a black vertical pipe, a small sign, and a metal handrail, while a reddish-orange wall is visible on the far right edge.

The camera gradually moves forward into the scene. The dark grey pole and the white car, initially to the front-left, progressively move out of frame as the viewpoint advances. Simultaneously, the arched passageway in the center-front appears closer and larger, expanding the view into its dark interior. The stone wall on the front-right also moves closer to the viewer, while the reddish-orange wall on the far right disappears.

The first frame presents a view into a dark stone archway with a cobbled path, leading towards a smaller, distant arch revealing a building with a red roof. To the left, a wall features leafy green and white plants in stone planters and a partially visible brown window blind. On the right, a textured stone wall displays a light-colored door, a metal handrail, and a dark framed sign.

As the perspective moves forward into the tunnel, the sign on the right wall becomes progressively clearer, now legible as 'BED & BREAKFAST SAN GIORGIO', and noticeably closer. The light at the distant end intensifies, revealing more details of the subsequent bright passage and structures beyond.

The first frame shows a narrow, dark, cobblestone alleyway receding into the distance, flanked by textured stone walls on both sides. To the viewer's immediate left, a stone planter filled with green plants is visible. On the right-hand wall, a white rectangular sign hangs, displaying text and images, and below it, a partially visible light-colored wooden door with dark handles is present. At the far end of the alley, a brighter, arched opening reveals another section of a narrow street with buildings beyond the viewer's current position.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward into the alley. The white sign on the right wall slides out of view to the right, revealing more of the stone wall and a horizontal metal railing that becomes increasingly visible along the right side. The light-colored door on the right also moves closer and then mostly out of frame to the right, while the arched opening in the distance appears slightly larger, indicating continued forward motion.
