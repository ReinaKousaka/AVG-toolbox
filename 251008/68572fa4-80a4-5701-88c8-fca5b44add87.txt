The first frame displays a glossy black surface, likely a piano, adorned with decorative items against a light-colored wall, featuring a golden rail across the mid-ground. On the right, a rattan-framed photo of a child is prominently displayed; moving left are a gold candle holder with a pink candle, a potted white orchid in a pink pot, a green hexagonal container, and another gold candle holder, with additional framed photos and books further left.

As the frames progress, the camera smoothly pans to the right. The rattan-framed photo moves out of view to the right, while objects previously on the far left, such as a stack of books and two framed photos, become more fully visible. The orchid, green container, and the left candle holder shift right relative to the viewer, appearing more centered within the frame.
