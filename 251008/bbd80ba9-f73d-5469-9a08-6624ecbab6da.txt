The first frame presents a vibrant yellow-leaved tree dominating the foreground left and center, partially obscuring a paved road. To the right, a concrete sidewalk borders dry grass, with a lamppost holding a red stop sign in the midground. A large multi-story building is visible in the background to the right.
end of description
In subsequent frames, pedestrians are seen crossing the road from left to right in the midground, while a white car initially approaches and then proceeds through the crosswalk. The leaves on the foreground tree subtly sway, indicating minor movement from wind or camera shake.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame features a large tree with brilliant yellow autumn leaves in the left and upper-center, its trunk grounded in mulch beside a paved road. A sidewalk runs parallel to the viewer on the right, across from the road where pedestrians are crossing a crosswalk and two cars are stopped, all situated before multi-story buildings under a blue sky.
end of description
Following frames show pedestrians continuing to move across the crosswalk from the left side of the road towards the right. The silver and white cars, initially positioned on the road near the left side of the crosswalk, proceed forward towards the right and eventually exit the frame. New pedestrians appear from the left, joining those crossing the road towards the right side.

The first frame displays a street scene on a sunny day. In the immediate foreground on the left is the trunk of a tree with lush yellow-green leaves extending into the top left of the frame. To the right of the tree and occupying the center-right foreground is a paved sidewalk with scattered dry leaves, bordered by a patch of dry grass on its far right edge. A black lamppost featuring a red stop sign and a green street sign stands centrally on the sidewalk. Beyond the sidewalk, a road extends from the left midground towards the center, where several pedestrians are seen crossing from left to right, near a stopped silver car on the left side of the road. Further back on the right, multiple large buildings line the street, with more distant buildings and a clear blue sky in the background.

end of description

In subsequent frames, the pedestrians continue crossing the road from left to right in the midground, eventually clearing the crosswalk. A white car, initially partially obscured, becomes fully visible on the midground road behind the silver car, driving from left to right. Finally, a dark SUV appears from the far left foreground, entering the frame and driving right along the road, passing closer to the viewer than the other vehicles.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a prominent lamppost stands slightly right of center in the mid-foreground, with yellowing tree leaves partially visible in the upper left. To its left, a black SUV is actively turning left onto a street where two other cars are further back. A red stop sign is visible behind the lamppost, next to a group of pedestrians on a crosswalk and sidewalk extending right, bordering a dry grassy patch. Modern buildings line both sides of the street in the background under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The black SUV, initially turning left from the foreground-left, drives straight away from the viewer, moving into the mid-distance on the left side of the road and eventually exiting the frame to the left, revealing the road behind it. Concurrently, the group of pedestrians on the crosswalk to the right of the central lamppost gradually moves from left to right, clearing the crosswalk and continuing along the sidewalk towards the right of the frame.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame features a dark grey lamp post on the foreground left, a sidewalk with a directional arrow extending forward, and a road curving slightly left into the midground. A black SUV is positioned on the road, moving away from the viewer, with buildings like the Peter A. Allard School of Law on the right and other structures to the left, under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The black SUV continues moving away from the viewer on the left lane, while pedestrians on the right sidewalk also proceed forward. Subsequently, a white SUV emerges from behind the black SUV and to its left, joining the flow of traffic away from the initial viewpoint. Further vehicles become visible down the road, beyond the stop sign to the left, all moving in the same direction away from the viewer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a street scene with a paved road curving left and a sidewalk on the right foreground, marked with a white directional arrow. Buildings line both sides, including a large structure labeled 'Purdue Academic Center' to the right and other buildings behind trees to the left. A lamppost with a red stop sign is central, with a silver sedan and a black SUV on the road in the mid-ground, and several pedestrians visible on both sidewalks.
end of description
In the following frames, the silver sedan on the left and the black SUV near the stop sign both slowly advance forward along the road. Pedestrians on the right sidewalk continue walking, with the person in black moving further into the mid-ground past a red pole. Additionally, new pedestrians gradually appear from behind the viewer's right, entering the frame and proceeding down the right sidewalk.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a street curving left from the foreground, flanked by multi-story buildings on both sides. To the left, a beige building stands with trees and pedestrians on a sidewalk, while to the right, the Farris Building has people on its sidewalk and adjacent grassy area, with a yellow curb in the lower right. A central pole with a red STOP sign and a green directional plaque separates the street from a pedestrian path lined with bollards and small trees, with two cars visible on the street to the left.
end of description.
In subsequent frames, the two initial cars on the street move forward to the left, and a new dark car enters from the far left of the first-frame viewpoint, also proceeding forward. Pedestrians on both sidewalks, including a person with a small dog appearing on the grass to the far right, continue to move across the scene relative to the static first-frame viewpoint.
