A street scene shows a paved sidewalk extending into the distance, flanked by tall city buildings. In the immediate foreground, a person in a denim jacket and white face mask is partially visible on the left, while another person with a colorful shirt and black backpack is seen from behind on the far right. A third person in a blue shirt and shorts, carrying a white bag with a red bullseye, walks away from the viewer in the right mid-ground. To the left, a "VANS" store with red signs and an "OLD NAVY" store are visible, and to the right, a street with a blue and white bus moving away into the distance.
end of description
The person in the denim jacket moves out of frame to the left, while the blue and white bus on the street also continues moving away and eventually disappears. Pedestrians on the sidewalk shift their positions, with some moving closer to the viewer, and others further away. A yellow taxi appears on the street to the right, moving into the distance. The person wearing a dark jacket and light pants on the left sidewalk gradually approaches the viewer and then exits the frame to the left.
