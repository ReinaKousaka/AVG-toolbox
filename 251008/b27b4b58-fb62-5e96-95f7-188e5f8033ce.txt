The first frame displays a scenic mountain valley under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a bright green grassy slope dominates the lower right, featuring a small, rustic wooden building slightly right of center, and further left, parts of a village with dark-roofed houses nestled at the base of a forested mountain. Midground trees with autumn foliage stand behind the building, while towering mountains with dense forests frame both sides of the valley, with a light-colored rock face visible in the distant center-right.
end of description
The viewpoint continuously pans to the right across the valley. The small wooden building and the village, initially on the left side of the first frame, progressively shift leftward relative to the original viewpoint. Concurrently, new parts of the forested valley emerge from the right of the initial frame's view, expanding the visible landscape to the right of the first-frame's central axis. Objects originally near the center of the first frame, like the distant rock face, gradually move towards the left edge of the evolving view.
