The first frame presents a rustic two-story wooden house with a white lower facade occupying the center. To its left, stacked logs are partially visible against the house, while a trailer with yellow wheels, coiled hoses, and a tarp rests on the asphalt path in the foreground. A winding uphill road extends to the right, leading past green foliage and a multi-story wooden building with red windows in the background.

Subsequently, a blue car emerges from the lower right of the frame and moves towards the left, passing the house. Concurrently, a person walks uphill on the road to the right of the house, and another white house becomes visible further right in the background.
