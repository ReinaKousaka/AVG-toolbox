The first frame shows a bustling street scene at dusk, with a large, multi-story building featuring illuminated windows and "PIT EASY" signage prominently in the mid-right. People walk on the sidewalk in front of this building, and multiple cars are present on the street in the foreground, including a white car on the far left and another white car near some orange barriers on the right. A crosswalk is visible in the immediate foreground, and tall buildings line the street further left and behind the main structure, all under a dark blue sky with overhead tree branches.
end of description
A white car initially on the left in the foreground moves forward and exits the frame, while a black and white taxi enters from the right foreground and proceeds left across the crosswalk. Concurrently, the traffic light on the left transitions from red to green, and a new white car, a white SUV, and a yellow car all move across the street from various directions. Subsequently, another black car and a second yellow taxi enter from the right foreground, continuing the flow of traffic across the scene.
