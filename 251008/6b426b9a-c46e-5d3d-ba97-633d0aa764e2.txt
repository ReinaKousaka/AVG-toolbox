The first frame presents a wide, wet asphalt city street viewed from street level, looking down a long thoroughfare flanked by multi-story buildings and trees. Prominent white crosswalk stripes and turn arrows are in the foreground, while numerous cars are visible moving slowly or stopped in the midground, reflecting the overcast sky and storefront lights.
