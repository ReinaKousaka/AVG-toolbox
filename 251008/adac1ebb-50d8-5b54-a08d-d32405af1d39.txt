The first frame displays train tracks curving gently left into the distance, bordered by a rocky hillside on the left and a dirt embankment leading to a dense forest on the right, all beneath an overcast sky. An overhead catenary pole is visible on the far right, and "Vmax: 90km/h" appears in the bottom left corner.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the tracks, the rocky hillside to the left reveals more detail and a fence appears above it, while the curve ahead becomes more prominent. A yellow marker sign reading "368 5" emerges on the left side of the tracks, near the hillside, advancing towards the viewer as utility poles continuously shift into view and then out of the frame further along the track's path.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The viewer is positioned looking straight ahead along train tracks that recede into the distance, gently curving to the right. To the left, a steep, rocky hillside covered in lush green vegetation ascends, bordered by a fence running parallel to the tracks further up. On the right, a narrower strip of ground with dirt and sparse plants precedes a dense line of tall evergreen trees, with a prominent utility pole and overhead wires visible on this side.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the train tracks and their immediate surroundings continuously advance towards and past the viewer. The rocky hillside and fence on the left recede, constantly revealing new sections of the wooded slope. On the right, the utility pole passes out of view, followed by a concrete retaining wall that runs parallel to the tracks before also receding into the background. The dense evergreen forest on the right and the green hills on the left remain consistent features of the unfolding landscape as the curve in the tracks becomes more pronounced.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows train tracks extending forward into the distance, curving slightly to the right, laid on ballast in the foreground and midground. To the left, a hillside covered with green trees and some clear-cut areas slopes upwards, featuring a fence in the midground. To the right, a dense forest of dark green coniferous trees stands alongside the tracks, with a concrete retaining wall or platform edge running parallel to the tracks, and an overhead utility pole with lines visible above the tracks. The sky, a uniform overcast grey, occupies the upper portion of the frame, and a 'Vmax: 90km/h' watermark is in the bottom left.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the immediate foreground ballast and sleepers recede, continuously revealing new sections of the curving track ahead. The cleared areas and rock faces on the hillside to the left become more prominent as the train progresses into what was previously midground. On the right, the dense forest and concrete retaining wall extend further, with a new utility pole and a small yellow sign attached to it becoming visible further down the track. The overhead lines remain visible directly above, leading into the distant curve. The overall forested environment persists, with the perspective constantly shifting forward through the railway corridor.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a train track extending centrally into the distance, gently curving to the left. To the left of the track, a steep, green-forested slope with rocks and a fence rises, while to the right, a dense, dark coniferous forest borders the tracks, featuring a utility pole and a yellow triangular sign further along.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the surrounding landscape continuously slides past. Rocks and vegetation on the left, and trees and utility poles on the right, progressively appear closer before receding behind the viewpoint. The yellow triangular sign to the right of the tracks also approaches, grows larger, and then begins to recede into the distance as the journey continues, constantly revealing new sections of the forested valley ahead.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a train track extending into the distance, curving slightly left, flanked by dense green, tree-covered hills on both sides. On the left, large rocks and a wire fence are visible, while a utility pole with a yellow triangular sign stands in the mid-ground on the right.

end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the tracks, foreground elements like the initial rocks on the left recede and exit the frame. The yellow sign on the right, originally in the mid-ground, moves closer, resolving into a '7' with a smaller yellow '+5' sign appearing below it on the same pole, before these too pass out of frame as the train progresses through the continuously wooded and hilly landscape, revealing more of the fence on the left.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, train tracks extend from the foreground towards the middle distance, curving slightly right, flanked by gravel. To the left, a steep, green, bushy hillside with scattered deciduous trees rises, featuring a wire fence with posts receding into the distance. To the right, another green, wooded slope with evergreen trees is visible, along with a utility pole and overhead wires further back. A light grey, overcast sky fills the top central portion, while distant blue-grey mountains are visible beyond the curve in the background. A "Vmax: 90kmh" text overlay is present in the bottom-left corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the train moves forward along the tracks, causing the immediate track sections and adjacent scenery to continuously recede from the first-frame viewpoint. The verdant hillsides on both sides appear to pass by the viewer, revealing new sections of the forested landscape further along the path. The fence on the left and utility poles on the right emerge from the distance, move towards the viewer, and then disappear out of frame, maintaining a consistent mountainous and wooded environment.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, train tracks extend directly ahead from the viewer, curving gently to the right into the distance, flanked by dense green vegetation on both sides. A steep, tree-covered hillside with a fence runs along the viewer's left, while a lower, similarly vegetated embankment with a concrete structure and an overhead line support pole is visible to the right. An overcast sky sits above distant forested mountains in the background.
end of description.
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, all foreground elements like the bushes, trees, the fence on the left, and the concrete structure and overhead line pole on the right, continuously recede towards the viewer's sides and behind. This progression constantly reveals fresh sections of the curving track ahead and the uninterrupted natural scenery of forested hills and dense greenery as the journey unfolds through the mountainous terrain.
