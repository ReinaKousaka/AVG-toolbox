The first frame depicts a paved road curving gently to the right, lined on both sides by dense evergreen trees and low stone walls, under a blue sky with scattered white clouds; double yellow lines mark the center, and a white line defines the right shoulder.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the immediate road surface and its markings to advance towards and past the initial viewpoint. The dense evergreen trees and stone walls flanking both sides of the road also move from the mid-ground to the foreground and then recede behind the viewer, continuously revealing more of the road and forest further ahead in the distance. The curve of the road to the right becomes increasingly prominent in the visual field.
