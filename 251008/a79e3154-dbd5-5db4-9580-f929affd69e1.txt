In the foreground to the right, a tree with red berries partially obscures a grassy park containing red benches and a bare tree. A paved promenade in the mid-ground features pedestrians and a street lamp, stretching alongside a lake that fronts a large, building-covered mountain in the background, with more mountains to the far left under a blue, cloudy sky.

The camera gradually pans right and slightly zooms out, revealing more of the lake and townscape to the right of the main mountain, while the foreground tree shifts further right. Pedestrians continuously move along the promenade from left to right, with new figures, including a person with a stroller, appearing from the left.

The first frame shows a waterfront park with a paved walkway on the left foreground, where people walk and sit on red benches near a lamppost, adjacent to a green grassy area on the right. A large, gnarled tree stands prominently on the far right foreground. Across the water, a city lines the base of a large, dark mountain dominating the left background under a blue, cloudy sky.
end of description
As the view slowly pans right, the lamppost and the person on the far left of the initial view exit the frame to the left, while new buildings and trees on the far right of the first-frame viewpoint become visible, extending the park and urban landscape.
