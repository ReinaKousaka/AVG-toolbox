The first frame presents a narrow, wet street at night flanked by buildings, with a white bicycle and a black car parked to the immediate left, and a silver van and white car to the right; a red and green vending machine are positioned behind the bicycle, and a person walks into the illuminated distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the bicycle and silver van gradually move out of view to the left and right respectively, revealing more of the black and white cars that were previously behind them. The vending machines shift further left relative to the frame as the person in the distance continues to recede down the street.

In the first frame, the viewer looks down a narrow, wet street at night, flanked by buildings. A red vending machine with illuminated drinks is in the immediate left foreground, with a yellow vending machine and green canopy slightly behind it. To the right, a white van is parked in the foreground, facing away, while buildings with windows and balconies line both sides of the street, extending into the background where multiple lights illuminate the path and a distant person walks away. Overhead, utility lines crisscross the dark sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera slowly moves forward down the street. The red and yellow vending machines on the left and the white van on the right gradually move out of their respective sides of the frame. This forward motion reveals more of the street and the building facade with a dark roll-down door on the left, while the distant person continues to recede further down the street.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a narrow, wet street at night, flanked by buildings. To the immediate left, a green pole with a yellow-green rectangular sign and a smaller red sign stands. On the left, a building features a large garage door and an external staircase. On the right, a white van is partially visible, parked beside a multi-story building with a dark roof and white walls, in front of which are two orange cones. The street extends into the distance, reflecting various lights, with several hanging lanterns overhead and a person walking far down the alley.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The green and red signs on the left move closer and upward, revealing more Japanese text on the red sign. Simultaneously, the white van on the far right exits the frame, uncovering more of the adjacent building's facade. The distant pedestrian in the alley gradually appears larger as the viewer approaches, and the reflections on the wet street subtly shift.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a narrow, wet alley stretches into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings under a dark night sky. To the left, a green and yellow sign hangs above a red sign with Japanese text, followed by a white tiled building with a garage-like entrance and a balcony. A utility pole stands prominently in the center-left, adorned with signs and a red lantern-like traffic light hanging overhead. To the right, a white building with windows and a tiled roof is partially obscured by a dark fence with green foliage and two red traffic cones on the sidewalk. Reflections of vibrant neon lights and streetlights illuminate the wet pavement, with a lone figure holding an umbrella visible walking away in the far distance.

end of description

As the viewpoint slowly advances forward, the wet street and its reflections move beneath the viewer, revealing more of the illuminated alley ahead. The buildings and utility pole to the immediate left and right gradually shift towards the edges of the frame and eventually out of view. The figure with the umbrella in the distance becomes slightly larger and clearer, indicating the viewer is approaching them along the previously visible path.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a wet, illuminated city alleyway at night, extending into the distance with buildings on either side. To the left stands a white tiled building with a garage, a wooden fence, and a utility pole featuring a red lantern; on the right, a white building fronts a hedge, a black fence, and two orange traffic cones. A distant person walks away from the viewer along the street.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly advances forward; the utility pole shifts left as the tiled building and wooden fence exit the left side of the frame. Concurrently, the orange cones and yellow barrier on the right move out of view, progressively revealing more of the street and its illuminated storefronts ahead.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a narrow, wet, neon-lit alleyway at night, stretching into the distance. In the immediate foreground, the reflective asphalt ground reflects the surrounding lights. To the left, a wooden lattice fence is followed by a utility pole adorned with signs, behind which buildings with glowing windows and signs rise. To the right, a low white wall topped with green bushes and small lights occupies the foreground, with a red safety cone at its base, leading to a taller building with balconies and more illuminated signage. In the far distance, a lone figure walks away, under a dark sky framed by overhead wires and additional building lights.
end of description
The camera slowly moves forward into the alleyway. The wooden lattice fence and utility pole on the immediate left, along with the red cone and bushes on the immediate right, gradually recede out of view to the sides and slightly behind the first-frame viewpoint. This movement reveals more of the building facades on both sides, notably an escalator or staircase structure rising diagonally upwards on the left. The distant figures walking away remain ahead of the viewer as the perspective shifts deeper into the illuminated passage.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a narrow, wet city alley at night, flanked by multi-story buildings adorned with numerous illuminated signs reflecting on the damp ground. To the left, a building features an ascending external staircase and glowing rectangular signs, while on the right, a low white wall fronts dense green bushes and flowers.
end of description
Starting from frame five, a dark figure emerges from the distant center of the alley. This figure, gradually revealed to be a person, steadily walks closer towards the viewer with each subsequent frame.
