In the first frame, a wet city street scene on a rainy day is visible. In the foreground, a dark, wet sidewalk with reflective puddles and three black bollards with yellow tops curves to the right, meeting a street with a white crosswalk marking and shimmering reflections from headlights. To the left, a store with a red "kt" sign and a colorful arch of balloons stands, with several promotional signs displaying "9.9" and Korean text. In the midground, a man in a blue shirt and jeans with a clear umbrella, followed by a woman in a black top and white shorts with another clear umbrella, walk from right to left on the sidewalk, with a third person with a dark umbrella further back. To the right, a traffic light pole displays a green pedestrian signal showing the number '3', and a white pickup truck along with other cars with illuminated headlights are present on the street.

end of description

The green pedestrian signal to the right dynamically counts down from '3' to '0'. Concurrently, the man and woman with clear umbrellas, along with the third person, walk progressively from right to left across the wet sidewalk, moving further away from the viewer. Vehicles on the wet street to the right, including the white truck, slowly advance forward down the street. The entire scene subtly shifts rightwards due to a slight camera pan, revealing more of the foreground bollards on the right.
