The first frame depicts a narrow outdoor alley lined with shops under an overcast sky. To the viewer's right, a modern storefront with a large glass window displays rows of clothes on hangers inside and a red sign with Korean text and "Vintage" on it. A raised wooden platform with a white plastic bag sits in front of this shop. To the viewer's left, an older brick building has clothing racks with various garments hanging outside. In the midground, a person wearing a white jacket and blue hat walks away from the viewer, down the alley towards more distant shops, one of which has a red "MIGNON VINTAGE" sign.

The person in the white jacket and blue hat moves continuously further away from the viewer, progressing deeper down the alley. There are no newly revealed objects or scenes, only minor camera adjustments that cause slight shifts in the existing storefront reflections and overall perspective.

In the first frame, a narrow alleyway is visible, lined with shops. To the right, a dark grey building features a large glass display window filled with clothes on hangers, with a wooden bench and a white plastic bag directly in front of it on the ground. Further down the right, another section of the building has a red sign and a "MIGNON VINTAGE" sign, displaying more clothes on racks outside. To the left, a brick wall also has clothes racks with various garments. An elderly man in a white jacket and hat walks towards the viewer in the midground of the alley, holding a white bag, with trees and power lines visible in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the man walking in the alley moves steadily closer to the viewer and slightly to the left, and a second person walking behind him becomes slightly more visible. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the scene remains largely static except for the people's movement towards the first-frame viewpoint.
