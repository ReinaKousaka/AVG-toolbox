The first frame displays a grey asphalt road with white pedestrian stripes extending towards distant green-and-rocky mountains under a blue sky with scattered clouds. Multi-story buildings with stone and wooden facades flank the road, with a more prominent building featuring balconies on the left and a partially visible structure behind a landscaped area with evergreen trees and shrubs, including a tall pine, on the right. Several cars are parked further down the road, and a small red object is visible on the right sidewalk.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, an ornate black streetlamp with two lanterns emerges from behind the tall evergreen tree on the right, gradually becoming fully visible. Subsequently, a red fire hydrant and a 'pedestrian crossing' sign on a pole are revealed further to the right of the initial streetlamp. The pedestrian crossing stripes recede, the buildings on both sides become more distinct, and a bench is uncovered to the left as a second identical streetlamp appears further ahead on the right.

The first frame shows a paved road extending into the distance, bordered by chalet-style buildings and pine trees. On the immediate right, a lamppost with two lanterns and a blue pedestrian crossing sign stands near a flowerbed, while wooden benches are to the left of the road. In the background, a large, rocky mountain rises under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint advances forward along the road, causing the lamppost and pedestrian sign to move out of frame to the right. The buildings on both sides become more fully revealed as the camera approaches them, and parked cars appear closer.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a mountain village street with a paved road leading towards a large, green mountain in the distance under a clear blue sky. Buildings with stone and wood architecture and conifer trees line both sides of the road; a silver SUV is parked on the left, while a grey van, a white car, and a dark car are parked on the right near a decorative street lamp.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances forward, the grey van and white car on the right shift out of frame to the right, revealing more of a black car and a motorcycle parked behind them, along with a newly apparent pedestrian crossing in the right foreground. Concurrently, the silver SUV on the left moves forward, exposing more of a white car previously obscured behind it, and the street lamp on the right becomes more prominent.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures a mountain village street extending towards a distant, towering mountain under a bright blue sky, flanked by alpine-style buildings and dense pine trees, with a white van parked on the left and a black SUV and another white van on the right, alongside a street lamp and a pedestrian crossing in the foreground.
end of description
As the scene progresses, a white car initially in the mid-distance moves towards and then past the original viewpoint to its left, while an orange-clad person emerges from behind the parked white van on the left side of the road. Concurrently, the yellow street lamp and the red cross sign, initially prominent in the foreground-right, recede backward relative to the first-frame viewpoint as the camera moves forward.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a pedestrian crossing in the immediate foreground of a road leading towards a distant mountain under a blue sky. To the left are a large building and a white van with a person in an orange vest, while on the right, the rear of a white van, a red car, a pedestrian sign, and a decorative street lamp are visible.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the initial white vans, red car, person, pedestrian sign, and street lamp all exit the frame behind the viewer. New yellow parking markings become visible on the road surface in the foreground, and more details of the buildings on the left and the treeline on the right are progressively revealed as the scene unfolds.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a paved road extends centrally into the distance, bordered by sidewalks on both sides marked with yellow lines. To the left, a person on a skateboard is visible near orange construction barriers, followed by two chalet-style buildings with wooden facades and dark roofs, and then more trees and a distant mountain range. On the right, an ornate black street lamp with a sign stands beside a row of tall evergreen trees, a stone wall, and a wooden planter, with more trees receding into the background. A prominent, rocky mountain fills the background under a blue sky with scattered clouds.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the road. The person on the left sidewalk, along with the construction barriers, recedes backward relative to the viewer, eventually moving out of frame. Simultaneously, the ornate street lamp and the wooden planter on the right also recede backward and move out of frame to the right. As the viewpoint progresses, a new structure resembling a gas pump and parked cars are revealed further ahead on the left side, behind the initial buildings. The distant mountain and side trees appear to grow slightly larger as the viewer approaches them but remain ahead and to the sides, respectively.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows the viewer looking down a paved road extending towards a distant, large rocky mountain under a clear blue sky. To the left, a multi-story building with a wooden upper facade and stone lower section stands next to the road, with some cars visible further down. To the right, a stone retaining wall runs alongside a sidewalk, behind which evergreen and deciduous trees grow, and a tall wooden street lamp pole is positioned ahead.

end of description

As the sequence progresses, the viewer moves forward along the road. The street lamp pole on the right approaches the viewer, moving past the original first-frame viewpoint to its right, revealing multiple yellow and black directional signs attached to its lower section. Simultaneously, the building on the left moves towards and then beyond the original left side of the first-frame viewpoint, while the mountain in the background remains a consistent, prominent feature ahead.
