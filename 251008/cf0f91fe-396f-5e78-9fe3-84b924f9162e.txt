The first frame shows the viewer positioned on snow-covered train tracks that curve gently to the right, extending forward into the distance. To the viewer's left, a snowy hillside descends, populated with bare deciduous trees and dark evergreen pines, with distant snow-capped mountains visible on the horizon. To the right, a steep, snow-dusted rock face rises, while overhead, several power lines stretch across the sky, supported by a utility pole visible on the left side.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the initial utility pole on the left passes closer to the viewer and eventually behind, while a new overhead gantry structure appears further along and passes above the tracks. Simultaneously, a long, dark wooden barrier becomes visible along the base of the rock face to the right, appearing initially in the mid-distance and then moving closer alongside the viewer. In the final frames, a tunnel entrance emerges into view straight ahead in the distance, at the end of the curving tracks, as the foreground trees on the left also move past the viewer.

The first frame shows snow-covered train tracks curving gently to the right in the foreground and distance, framed by a snow-covered hillside with evergreen trees and a wooden fence on the right, and a forest of bare deciduous and evergreen trees on the left under a bright sky. Overhead electrical lines and their support structure traverse the upper center, while a small white building and a dark tunnel entrance are visible ahead on the right side of the tracks.
end of description
As the train moves forward, the landscape ahead progressively approaches the viewer; the tracks, overhead lines, and surrounding snowy terrain scroll underneath, with an electricity pole passing to the left. The small white building and the tunnel entrance on the right side of the tracks draw closer, with another section of wooden fence becoming visible on the right as the train approaches the tunnel.

The viewer faces forward down snow-covered train tracks that lead towards a dark tunnel entrance ahead and slightly to the right, embedded in a rocky, snow-dusted cliff. To the left of the tracks, a small white building sits near the tunnel, while a tall, bare tree stands prominently to the far left, bordering a forested mountainside. Overhead, power lines extend forward, with a fence running along the tracks' immediate left side and another along the distant cliff face on the right.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward, causing the tunnel entrance, originally ahead, to grow larger and closer. Objects previously to the immediate left and right, like the small building and the rocky cliff, begin to shift towards the sides and slightly behind the viewer's forward path as they are approached and passed. Power poles and overhead lines continually enter the frame from above and pass by, moving out of view behind and to the sides as the train rapidly approaches the tunnel opening.
