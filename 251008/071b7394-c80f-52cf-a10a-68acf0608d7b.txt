A woman wearing a striped dress, yellow hat, and sunglasses stands centrally in the midground, facing slightly right with her right hand raised. Behind her on the open deck are light-colored cushioned seating with blue pillows, a wooden floor, and a captain's chair to her right. In the distant background, a vibrant marina scene unfolds with numerous boats, city buildings on the left, and a large white tent structure on the right, all under a clear blue sky.
