As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the road; the white fence posts on the left, initially plain, gradually reveal small red reflective strips on their side as they draw closer to the viewer. Consequently, the dirt road ahead exhibits evolving details of its uneven surface and forming puddles, while newer sections of the rocky embankment on the right come into view.
