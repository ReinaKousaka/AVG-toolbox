The first frame shows a sunny city street scene from a forward-facing perspective on a sidewalk. Directly in front of the viewer, the back of a person with long brown hair, wearing a dark jacket and grey pants, walks away while carrying a white tote bag. To the immediate right, a tree trunk is partially visible. To the left, a "Wells Fargo" bank storefront with large reflective windows extends into the distance, with another pedestrian visible further along this path. Beyond the immediate foreground, a street on the right features a green bike lane and numerous parked cars, flanked by tall city buildings under a clear blue sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk, advancing past the initial foreground tree trunk on the right. The person walking ahead remains consistently in front, moving further away from the first-frame viewpoint. The Wells Fargo storefront on the left and the parked cars on the right slowly recede as new sections of the street ahead are revealed. Notably, a yellow taxi becomes more distinct among the vehicles in the mid-distance to the right of the street.

The first frame presents a sunny city street from a sidewalk viewpoint. Directly ahead, a person with long hair walks away from the viewer, carrying a light bag. To the left, a Wells Fargo building with reflective windows lines the sidewalk, while to the right, a street with parked cars, a green bike lane, and a tree precedes another building and distant skyscrapers under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the street. The person initially ahead continues to walk further away from the original first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the street's features, including parked cars, the bike lane, and the buildings on both sides, progressively shift closer to and then pass the initial viewpoint's position, revealing more of the scene ahead.

The first frame shows the viewer on a sunlit city sidewalk looking down a bustling street. A woman with long brown hair and a white bag walks away from the viewer in the near-center, with other pedestrians further ahead on the left sidewalk. To the right, a street with a green bike lane features moving vehicles, including a white SUV and a black SUV, with yellow taxis in the distance, all flanked by multi-story buildings and tall skyscrapers under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective subtly moves forward along the sidewalk, causing the woman in the foreground and other pedestrians to recede further into the distance. The black SUV to the right moves forward and eventually out of frame to the right, while a yellow taxi behind it becomes more visible and moves ahead on the street.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a bright city street scene. To the viewer's left, a long building with storefronts and reflections lines a sunlit sidewalk where several pedestrians, including a woman with long hair in the immediate foreground, walk away from the viewer. A bare tree stands on the sidewalk to the right of the foreground woman. To the viewer's right, a green bike lane and a fire hydrant separate the sidewalk from a multi-lane street, where a white SUV is positioned slightly right of center, and two yellow taxis are further down the street. Tall buildings rise in the background under a clear blue sky, with another brown building visible on the far right.
end of description
The pedestrians on the left sidewalk, including the foreground woman, consistently continue walking away from the viewer down the street. The white SUV on the street, to the right of the viewer, slowly advances forward, away from the first-frame viewpoint. A new white sedan emerges behind and to the right of the white SUV, moving further away. The yellow taxis visible further down the street also progress forward, away from the viewer.

The first frame depicts a sunlit city street with pedestrians on a sidewalk to the left, including a man in a brown coat in the foreground, and storefronts lining the street. A bare-branched tree and bike racks separate the sidewalk from a green bike lane and street on the right, where a white SUV is parked and distant vehicles are visible, all under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As frames progress, pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue walking forward, with the man initially in the foreground moving out of frame to the viewer's left. Simultaneously, a person on an electric scooter appears in the bike lane to the right of the initial white SUV, moving forward and left, eventually passing the stationary SUV.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The initial frame presents a sunny city street from a sidewalk viewpoint, with a woman walking away from the viewer on the left, alongside a commercial building displaying 'DUANET' on its windows. In the foreground, a bare tree and black bike racks are positioned centrally, while a white SUV is parked to the right next to a green bike lane, opposite an orange-brown building, with city traffic and tall buildings receding into the distant background under a clear blue sky.

end of description

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the sidewalk, causing the woman, tree, and bike racks to shift gradually towards the left side of the frame. Simultaneously, the parked white SUV on the right moves further out of view to the right, revealing more of the orange-brown building and showcasing additional traffic moving away in the distance.

The first frame presents a city street scene from a sidewalk perspective on a sunny day. To the viewer's immediate right, a partial view of a white SUV is visible, parked next to a green bike lane and a set of black bicycle racks on the sidewalk. Ahead and slightly to the left, a woman with long, dark hair, wearing grey pants and a dark top, walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk, which is flanked by buildings featuring large, reflective storefronts, one labeled 'Arcade'. In the midground, a bare-branched tree and a green pole with red and blue signs stand between the sidewalk and a multi-lane road where several cars, including a yellow taxi, are visible. Tall buildings line both sides of the street in the background, under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly moves forward along the sidewalk. The white SUV and black bike racks on the right shift out of view as the camera advances past them. The woman walking ahead continues her path, moving further into the scene relative to the advancing viewpoint. The tree and the pole in the midground come closer to the viewer before moving past to the right, revealing more of the street ahead and the continued line of storefronts on the left.
