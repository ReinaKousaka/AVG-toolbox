A wet, reflective pedestrian street is visible under an overcast sky, with numerous people holding umbrellas. In the immediate foreground, a man in a blue shirt holding a teal umbrella walks from right to left, slightly to the left of the center. To his left, another person with a yellow umbrella walks in the same direction, while a partially visible individual with a black and white umbrella is on the right, walking away from the viewer. Shops with awnings and banners line both sides of the street, and trees are visible further down the path.

The man with the teal umbrella continues to walk from right to left, passing the first-frame viewpoint, gradually moving out of frame to the left. Simultaneously, the person with the yellow umbrella also progresses further leftward, and the individual with the black and white umbrella on the right recedes further down the street away from the first-frame viewpoint. Other pedestrians in the midground continue their movement along the wet street.

The first frame presents a wet, paved city street extending into the distance, flanked by buildings housing shops and lined with trees overhead. In the midground to the left, a person holds a purple umbrella while walking away from the viewer, with other pedestrians further down the street. To the right, a planter box filled with green plants and pink flowers sits next to the path where several individuals, holding umbrellas of various colors, are visible, some walking towards and others away from the viewer.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the people on the street continue to move, with the individual holding the purple umbrella walking further away from the viewer on the left, while pedestrians on the right also progress along the street. A new white sign, previously obscured, becomes visible behind the planter box on the right side of the street, closer to the viewer than the distant buildings. The rain persists, maintaining the wet appearance of the pavement and necessitating the use of umbrellas by all pedestrians.
