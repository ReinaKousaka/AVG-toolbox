The first frame shows the viewer looking into a modern car showroom through a wide glass facade. In the immediate foreground is a concrete ground, with a vertical metal door frame on the right, beside which a small black stand is placed. Inside the showroom, from left to right, a dark grey SUV is visible, followed by a green potted plant in a planter, two dark grey display stands, another dark grey SUV partially obscured by a pillar, and a white SUV positioned prominently on the right. The interior features white walls, recessed ceiling lights, and a Hyundai logo on the back wall.

Beginning in frame 4, a woman holding a child emerges from the far left, walking right across the concrete path in front of the showroom's glass facade. A man then follows her from the left in frame 5, also walking right and both wearing masks, as they continue to pass the showroom. Concurrently, the white SUV inside the showroom gradually rotates, shifting its front angle from slightly rightward to facing more directly left. The pair continues walking right, with the man placing his arm around the woman, before gradually moving out of the frame.

The first frame features two masked individuals walking from the right to the left in the foreground, partially obscuring a brightly lit Hyundai car dealership across the street. Inside the glass-fronted showroom, a dark grey SUV is prominently displayed to the left, with a white car visible further back, and another dark SUV partially obscured behind a pillar and foliage to the right. The Hyundai logo is visible at the top left of the building facade.

As the two individuals walk past and exit the frame to the left, the dark grey SUV inside the dealership on the right becomes fully visible. More of the showroom's interior is revealed, showing a potted tree and several people moving further inside the display area to the right of the main vehicles.
