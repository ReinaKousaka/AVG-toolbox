A woman with a phone walks towards the viewer on the left sidewalk, passing a brick building with black awnings, while a man in a gray t-shirt follows closely behind her. Further down the sidewalk, a man in a white tank top walks away from the viewer. To the right, two stacks of white plastic chairs sit beside a decorative black fence, beyond which a tree and distant buildings are visible under a clear blue sky.

The woman and the man in the gray t-shirt continue walking past the viewer on the left side, eventually exiting the frame. The man in the white tank top proceeds further away from the viewer, while another person emerges from behind the stacked chairs, also walking into the distance. Towards the end, a "10th AVENUE" text overlay appears at the bottom left of the scene.

The first frame depicts a city sidewalk scene: a brick building with large glass windows and a black railing occupies the left foreground, while two stacks of white plastic chairs and a small tree are on the right. Several men walk away from the viewer along the sidewalk, towards background buildings and street signs, including "Death Ave", visible under a blue sky. "10th AVENUE" is overlaid at the bottom left.

As the frames progress, the camera moves forward along the sidewalk; the initial foreground objects on the left and right gradually recede from view, while more of the sidewalk and buildings further down the street ahead are progressively revealed, and the men continue walking further into the distance.

The first frame presents a sunlit street scene looking forward, with a dark storefront and a black railing on the left, featuring red flowers near the railing. A person sits on steps next to the doorway on the mid-left, while several pedestrians walk away from the viewer on the dappled sidewalk ahead. To the right, a large stack of light chairs is partially hidden by a tree.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly moves forward and slightly to the right. The walking figures recede further into the distance on the sidewalk ahead, while the stacked chairs on the right become more fully visible as the camera passes them.
