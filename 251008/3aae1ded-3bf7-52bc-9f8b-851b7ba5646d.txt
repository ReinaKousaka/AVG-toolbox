The first frame displays a snow-covered city street at night. In the foreground, the street and a pedestrian crosswalk are coated in snow, showing tire impressions. To the left, a snow-dusted road extends into the distance, lined by dimly lit buildings and a prominent streetlamp with a glowing yellow light and a green traffic signal. To the right of center, a multi-story building with a rounded glass facade, labeled "FOOD COURT" and "WATERFRONT CENTRE" and featuring business logos like McDonald's, is visible, with a utility pole directly in front of it. Snowflakes are actively falling across the entire scene.
end of description
Throughout the sequence, snowflakes continuously fall across the entire scene. From frame 5, a pedestrian appears on the sidewalk in front of the Waterfront Centre building, to the right of the main pole, and walks leftwards towards the building's entrance. Concurrently, a traffic light affixed to the pole near the Waterfront Centre building (right of center) illuminates red from frame 6, remaining so for the rest of the sequence.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a snow-covered urban street scene at night. In the foreground, a wide, snowy road with visible tire tracks and faint crosswalk lines stretches towards the viewer. To the right, a multi-story building with a curved glass facade and signs like 'FOOD COURT' and 'WATERFRONT CENTRE,' along with McDonald's and RBC logos, stands beside a snow-dusted sidewalk. Numerous streetlights, predominantly yellow and green, illuminate the falling snow along the street that recedes into the distance on the left, with more buildings lining its side. A black trash can is visible near the center-left, adjacent to the road.
end of description
Across the subsequent frames, the primary dynamic change observed is the continuous fall of snow, with individual flakes appearing in slightly different positions and densities against the illuminated streetlights and building facades. No new objects or significant shifts in existing elements are revealed; the overall scene remains static except for the persistent snowfall.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a snow-covered city street at night, featuring a prominent crosswalk in the foreground and an intersection in the midground illuminated by warm streetlights and a green traffic signal to the left. To the right, a multi-story building displays "FOOD COURT & SHOPS" and "WATERFRONT CENTRE" signage with various business logos at street level, while heavy snowfall creates a hazy glow around all light sources.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the traffic light on the left dynamically changes from green to yellow, then to red. The intensity and visual density of the actively falling snow subtly shift as it's illuminated by the streetlights, maintaining the wintry urban atmosphere.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures a snow-covered street intersection at night, featuring visible tire tracks and faint crosswalk lines in the immediate foreground. To the left, a street curves away with illuminated buildings and distant car headlights, centered by a pole with active yellow and green traffic lights. On the right, a prominent rounded building displays "WATERFRONT CENTRE" and "FOOD COURT & SHOPS" signs, alongside various commercial logos and a red traffic light on an adjacent pole.
end of description
Across the following frames, heavy snowfall dynamically fills the entire scene, with individual snowflakes constantly changing their positions relative to the viewer, creating a continuous visual flow. No new objects or significant structural changes are revealed; the scene consistently portrays the ongoing, static snowstorm from the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a snowy city street at night, looking down a thoroughfare. In the foreground, snow covers the asphalt with tire tracks, and a crosswalk is partially visible. To the left, a street extends with illuminated buildings and a pedestrian, while a black trash can sits at the corner, and a bright streetlight hangs overhead. On the right, a large, modern building labeled "WATERFRONT CENTRE" and "FOOD COURT SHOPS" features a rounded glass facade, a McDonald's sign, and a red traffic light stands beside it. Snow is visibly falling throughout the scene.
end of description.
No dynamic changes or newly revealed objects are observed in the subsequent frames; the scene remains static with consistent snow falling.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a snow-covered city street at night, with heavy flakes falling under glowing streetlights. A curved building, identified as 'Waterfront Centre' and 'Food Court & Shops', stands to the right alongside a traffic light displaying red, while the road on the left recedes into the distance with a green traffic light and vehicles.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the heavy snowfall persists across the scene. The red traffic light on the right dynamically changes to green, joining the continuously green light visible on the left side of the street.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a snowy city night scene. In the foreground, a snow-covered road with tire tracks curves towards the left, with a dark cylindrical bin on the curb to the mid-left. To the right, a large, modern building with a curved glass facade features "WATERFRONT CENTRE" signage at eye level and "FOOD COURT & SHOPS" higher up, along with several retail logos including McDonald's. Overhead to the left, a traffic light pole displays a green light, while another traffic light further down the street shows red. Snowflakes are visibly falling across the entire scene.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the falling snow remains a dynamic element, visibly shifting its position and density. The most significant change occurs from frame 6 to frame 7, where the distant traffic light on the street, which was previously red, changes to green. This green light persists in the remaining frames.
