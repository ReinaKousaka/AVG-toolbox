The first frame presents a sunny urban street scene. In the immediate foreground to the viewer's left is a grey planter with green foliage, with a person's arm partially visible at the bottom left. A metallic newsstand with a blue "Expensify" sign and a green awning stands in the mid-ground left, displaying packaged goods through its glass front. A bustling sidewalk occupies the right and center, where five pedestrians walk away from the viewer, alongside a modern building with dark reflective windows. A street with parked and moving cars stretches into the background, flanked by tall city buildings and a distant monument, all under a partly cloudy sky.

The initial group of pedestrians on the right continues walking away from the viewer, moving deeper into the scene. As the viewpoint subtly shifts forward, a vendor becomes visible inside the newsstand's counter space. Concurrently, a new pedestrian, a woman in a white shirt and dark pants, emerges from behind the newsstand and begins crossing the street to the left of its original position. Vehicles continue to navigate the street in the background, while other pedestrians further down the street also exhibit movement.

The first frame captures a sunlit city street with a light green booth in the left foreground. A woman in a light shirt walks right from the far left, while another in a striped shirt approaches the viewer from the center-left street; concurrently, a man and woman walk away on the right sidewalk, alongside a tall dark building.
end of description
The woman from the street crosses and exits the frame to the right-foreground as the couple on the right sidewalk continues moving further away from the initial viewpoint. Subsequently, a new male pedestrian in a plaid shirt emerges from behind the woman in black, initially further away on the right sidewalk, and progressively walks towards the viewer, becoming more prominent and closer to the right-foreground of the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame captures two individuals walking away on a city sidewalk, bordered by a busy street with cars and buildings to their left, and a modern building with reflective windows to their right. Numerous pedestrians and distant buildings line the urban street ahead under a clear sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk, revealing more of the bustling street ahead. The two individuals continue walking away from the camera, and other pedestrians, previously further in the midground, now appear closer to the viewer's left as they are passed. The reflections in the building windows on the right also dynamically shift with the forward motion.
