Majestic, tree-covered mountains with rugged peaks dominate the left and background, enclosing the scene under a clear blue sky, with other buildings scattered in the mid-ground. end of description. As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the utility box, initially to the mid-left, to shift towards the foreground and then out of view to the viewer's left, indicating the viewer's passage past it. The distant houses and mountains are subtly approached, remaining ahead in the scene.
