In the first frame, a large cherry blossom tree with light pink flowers dominates the left foreground, its branches extending across the top of the frame. To its left, a multi-story white building with visible windows and balconies stands behind a green chain-link fence. A dirt and dry grass path stretches into the midground, lined with a row of similar cherry blossom trees. Further down the path on the right, indistinct figures (people) are visible, and beyond them, a grassy slope leads to what appears to be a river or canal with trees on the far bank under a bright sky.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the path. The prominent cherry blossom tree from the first frame progressively shifts to the left and recedes behind the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, more of the white building on the left becomes revealed, showcasing additional windows and balconies to the left of the original perspective. By the later frames, a distinct red object becomes visible on a balcony of the building, which was previously obscured from the starting position. The continuous line of cherry blossom trees and the grassy embankment on the right extend further into the distance ahead of the original viewpoint.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a wide dirt path, mottled with shadows from trees, stretching into the midground. To the viewer's left, a multi-story white residential building with numerous windows, balconies, and air conditioning units runs parallel to the path, fronted by a green chain-link fence. On one of the balconies near the top-left, clothes are visibly hanging. A prominent row of cherry blossom trees, laden with pink blossoms, lines the path, extending into the midground where several small human figures are discernible. To the right, a grassy embankment slopes away, with a river and faint distant buildings visible beyond the trees. The sky above is bright and largely clear.
end of description
The viewpoint continuously moves forward along the dirt path. Consequently, objects initially further ahead, such as the human figures and distant cherry blossom trees, gradually become larger and closer to the viewer. The residential building on the left and the fence running alongside it are progressively revealed further along their length as the scene advances. The closest cherry blossom trees to the immediate left and right of the path appear to shift backward and outwards from the center of the initial viewpoint as the viewer passes them.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the foreground and middle ground, a dirt path is lined by numerous cherry blossom trees adorned with pink flowers. To the left, a multi-story white building with balconies and a green wire fence runs alongside the path. To the right, a grassy slope descends towards a body of water in the far background, with a utility pole standing in the right middle ground. Several indistinct figures are visible walking further along the path in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the path. Consequently, all visible objects, including the cherry blossom trees, the building on the left, and the utility pole on the right, appear to subtly increase in size relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The shadows cast by the trees on the ground also show slight shifts in their patterns.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a dirt path extends forward, lined on both sides by cherry blossom trees laden with pink blooms, leading to distant figures and a white vehicle. To the left, a multi-story building is visible behind a chain-link fence, with a tree trunk in the immediate foreground, while on the right, another tree trunk with a wooden brace frames the view.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the path. Objects on the left, such as the building, fence, and foreground tree, gradually recede and shift out of the left side of the frame, while the path ahead and the distant figures and vehicle on the right become slightly closer and more centered relative to the original viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a path flanked by cherry blossom trees under a bright sky. To the left, a multi-story building stands behind a fence, with a large tree trunk in the mid-left foreground where a dark bag rests. A row of flowering cherry trees recedes into the distance along the path, which runs parallel to a body of water visible on the right, populated by several small distant figures. In the near right foreground, another cherry tree trunk with pink blooms is prominent, accompanied by a small wooden post.
end of description
The viewpoint gradually moves forward and slightly to the left through the subsequent frames. The foreground tree trunks on the left grow larger and shift further left in the frame. The entire line of distant cherry trees, the path, the riverbank, and the figures along it appear to shift closer and slightly rightward relative to their original positions in the first frame.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A large tree trunk with spreading branches dominates the foreground left, with a dark object nestled at its base; behind it, a fence runs parallel to a light-colored building. In the mid-ground, a grassy path lined with cherry blossom trees extends into the distance, where a figure walks, while to the right, a parallel path borders a body of water with other distant people.
end of description
The viewer moves forward and slightly right, causing the foreground tree trunk and the dark object to exit the frame to the left, while revealing more of the fence and the building. The path and its line of cherry trees become more central, and the walking figure from the first frame appears significantly closer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a path lined with cherry blossom trees bearing pink flowers, extending into the midground with sparse brown ground in the foreground. To the left, a large white building with windows is visible behind a fence, while a dirt path and a body of water are to the right. A person in a light trench coat stands in the midground, positioned to the left of the initial cherry blossom trees.
end of description
As the frames progress, the person consistently walks forward along the path, moving closer to the viewer and gradually shifting further left relative to their original position in the midground.
