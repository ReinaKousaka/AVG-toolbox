In the first frame, a wide gray asphalt road with a double yellow center line stretches from the bottom foreground into the distance under a clear blue sky. To the left, a gray car is parked beside a curb, beyond which lush green foliage, including several palm trees and hedges, partially obscures houses. On the right, a grassy verge leads to a large, dark green tree, followed by more green hedges, and a white SUV parked further down the street. In the far distance, a red vehicle is visible on the road, surrounded by more trees and houses.

end of description

As the viewer moves forward, the gray car on the left and the large tree on the right gradually pass out of view, moving to the left and right behind the viewer, respectively. The white SUV on the right approaches and then also moves to the right and behind the viewer. The red vehicle on the road in the distance comes closer, revealing itself to be a car before passing to the left and behind the viewer, while a white car then emerges in the far distance ahead. New sections of sidewalks, hedges, and houses continually become visible on both sides as the scene progresses.

In the first frame, a sunny residential street is viewed from a low perspective, looking straight ahead. The road occupies the foreground, marked by a double yellow line down the center and a white lane line to the right. To the viewer's left, a sidewalk fronts a white fence, a multi-story house, dense green foliage, and a tall utility pole. To the right, a sidewalk runs alongside a tall, manicured green hedge, partially obscuring a white SUV parked behind it, with a street light pole rising beside the sidewalk. Further down the street, an intersection with crosswalk markings is visible, with other vehicles stopped or moving slowly, and distant houses with red roofs are interspersed among numerous palm trees under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. A white sedan, initially in the mid-distance approaching the viewer, gradually draws closer and shifts from the center of the road towards the viewer's left lane. Concurrently, a 'No Parking' sign becomes visible on the street light pole positioned to the viewer's right. The white sedan continues its approach, eventually passing to the viewer's left side as the intersection also grows nearer.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a paved road stretching into the distance under a clear blue sky, with a white car driving away in the left foreground. To the left, a grassy slope with hedges and trees lines the road, while on the right, dense green foliage and a 'no parking' sign stand near the viewer. In the mid-distance, an intersection with a crosswalk, utility poles, streetlights, and distant houses with palm trees are visible.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint gradually moves forward, causing the white car to move further left and exit the frame, maintaining its general left-side position relative to the first-frame's view. A white pickup truck, initially visible far ahead at the intersection's right side, becomes clearer, with a silver car appearing behind it, further down the road from the first-frame viewpoint. The scene otherwise remains consistent, with only minor shadow shifts.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a sunny street looking towards an intersection, with a paved road and white crosswalk stripes directly in front of the viewer. Utility poles with traffic lights frame the immediate left and right, beside tall green hedges and trees. Across the intersection in the distance, vehicles including a red car, a white pickup, and a grey sedan are visible, with houses and numerous palm trees lining the street under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward towards the intersection. The traffic lights ahead and to the right, initially red, transition to green. Concurrently, cars previously stopped across the intersection, including the white pickup and grey sedan, begin to move further into and through the intersection, advancing past their initial positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a sunlit urban intersection with a prominent crosswalk spanning the street directly in front of the viewer, leading to a distant red traffic light. To the left, a utility pole with traffic signals (red) and street signs is visible, backed by a lush green hedge and a building. On the right, a white car is parked, and residential buildings with trees line the street, extending towards another traffic signal (red) in the mid-distance.
end of description
Subsequently, the traffic lights on the left and directly ahead transition from red to green. Following this change, vehicles previously stationary at the intersection, including a white SUV and a dark sedan directly ahead, and a white car on the far right, begin to advance through the intersection, moving further into the scene.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a sunny street intersection from a pedestrian's viewpoint at a crosswalk. White pedestrian stripes cover the foreground's asphalt, leading into a road lined with palm trees, houses, and cars under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left stands a tall green hedge and a utility pole with a green traffic signal, while a white car is parked on the right side street.
end of description
Both the overhead traffic signal to the left and the distant signal ahead transition from green to red, then back to green. The white car on the right side street moves forward and turns right, away from the viewer. Subsequently, a dark SUV and then a motorcycle emerge from the left side street, turning right onto the main road, also moving away. The viewpoint slightly shifts forward, enhancing the visibility of a "HOLMBY AVE" street sign on the left.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, the viewer is positioned at a street intersection, looking forward down a road with marked crosswalks. To the immediate left is a utility pole with a "WESTWOOD PL" street sign and dense green foliage, while a white Tesla Model 3 is stopped at the crosswalk on the right, in front of a white house with a red roof and more greenery. Straight ahead, traffic lights are green, and a blue "Fairfax" street sign is visible above distant palm trees and other vehicles. The sky is clear blue overhead.
end of description
As the frames progress, the white Tesla on the right moves forward and out of view. A pedestrian appears from behind the foliage on the far left, walking forward past the utility pole. Simultaneously, a white pickup truck, initially further back in the left lane, advances and crosses the intersection directly in front of the viewer, followed by other cars in the distance.
