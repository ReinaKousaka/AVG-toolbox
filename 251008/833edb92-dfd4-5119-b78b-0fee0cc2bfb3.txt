The first frame features a prominent reddish-brown building with a clock tower and a gray roof, standing centrally in the mid-ground. To its immediate right, a tall evergreen tree is visible, and further to the right, another multi-storied reddish-brown building with an American flag attached to its facade. Snow-covered mountains frame the background, with bare, snow-dusted trees on the slopes to the left. In the foreground, a snow-covered street or sidewalk extends forward, marked by several yellow cones, with a dark blue pickup truck barely visible entering from the far right edge.

In the subsequent frames, the dark blue pickup truck progressively moves from the far right edge further into the foreground. It slowly traverses left across the street, gradually revealing more of its front and then its passenger side. By the final frame, the truck is clearly visible to the right of the central clock tower building, positioned on the street nearest the viewer.

The first frame features a prominent reddish-brown courthouse with a clock tower displaying 9:09, situated on the center-left. A wide, orange-brown staircase leads up to its entrance, with a green pole and blue sign visible to its right foreground. To the right of the courthouse, a dark blue pickup truck is partially visible on a snow-dusted street, in front of a tall evergreen tree and a smaller, brick-red building displaying an American flag. Snow-capped mountains rise in the background under an overcast sky.

In subsequent frames, the blue pickup truck moves from its initial position on the right, driving left across the foreground. It progressively reveals more of the snow-covered street and the base of the evergreen tree behind its initial spot. The truck then passes in front of the evergreen tree and continues its leftward motion, eventually moving into the central-left foreground, partially obscuring the lower portion of the courthouse steps by the final frames.
