The first frame captures a road stretching forward beneath a lush canopy of green trees, with a white car ahead in the right lane and another white SUV-like vehicle with a cyclist behind it visible to the left, near a '40' speed limit sign; a circular navigation map is overlaid in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the viewer progresses, the white SUV and cyclist on the left move past and exit the frame to the left of the viewer's original position. Subsequently, a black car and another white car become visible parked further left along the road. The '40' speed limit sign, along with a 'no entry' and a 'turn right' sign, appear more central and closer on the left side of the road as the viewer moves forward. The white car initially ahead moves closer, maintaining its position in front, while the overarching tree canopy gradually envelopes the scene more intensely overhead and to the sides.
