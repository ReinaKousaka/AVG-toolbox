The first frame displays a street scene with a row of buildings on the left under an overcast sky. A prominent green and white pub, "Ha'penny Bridge Inn," is located in the mid-left, with other shops and buildings extending into the background. Several pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk in front of these buildings, while a man in a grey jacket walks towards the viewer on the right side of the street, partially visible. The road features white markings, including "LANA BUS," and blue buses are visible further down the street on the right.

In subsequent frames, the man in the grey jacket on the right foreground steadily walks towards the viewer, becoming less cropped and more central in the frame. Simultaneously, pedestrians on the left sidewalk near the 'Ha'penny Bridge Inn' continue to move, with some walking into the background and others moving towards the left edge. A green car, initially behind the blue buses in the distant right street, gradually pulls forward into the background.
