The first frame displays a large, curved beige stone building with glass windows in the background, fronted by wide concrete stairs with black railings and two lampposts in the midground. In the foreground, a man looks at his phone on the far right, while a woman in purple and a man in black walk left across a dirt ground towards the stairs, where other people are also visible.

As the frames progress, the man on the far right walks further right and out of view. The woman in purple and the man in black continue ascending the stairs towards the building, while a new couple emerges from the viewer's right onto the lower right stairs and begins to climb. Other figures on the stairs and inside the building shift positions.
