Following frames show the person on the motorcycle moving progressively closer to the viewer and slightly towards the left side of the street. Simultaneously, the pedestrian walking on the left advances towards the viewer, passing the utility pole. The pedestrian on the right side of the street gradually moves further away from the viewpoint, deeper into the scene. The person standing near the real estate office on the right makes slight movements, looking down at their hands throughout the sequence.

The first frame captures a bustling night street in a city, with buildings lining both sides of a narrow road adorned with numerous brightly lit signs in Korean characters. A person on a black motorcycle, facing away from the viewer, is positioned in the middle of the street over a "30" speed limit marking, while a person in dark clothing stands to the far right near an air conditioning unit. On the left, a pharmacy with a red sign and a utility pole covered in posters are visible, opposite various shops and a food stall on the right.
end of description
The motorcycle rider slowly moves forward, receding down the street, as the person initially on the far right shifts to stand inside the adjacent food stall. Simultaneously, pedestrians on both sidewalks continue walking away from the viewer, and a vehicle briefly appears in the far distance before also moving further down the road, leaving the central street clearer.

The first frame displays a brightly lit street at night, flanked by numerous storefronts adorned with glowing vertical and horizontal signs, predominantly in Korean. To the left, a utility pole covered in flyers stands beside two blue A-frame signs and a storefront window, while on the right, a food stall with a red awning features a visible worker and a counter laden with food items. The number '30' is painted on the street directly in front of the viewer, and several pedestrians are visible further down the street towards the receding background.

After the initial frame, a person on a white scooter with a black delivery box begins to enter from the bottom-left of the first-frame viewpoint, moving towards the center of the street. The scooter then proceeds to travel away from the viewer, down the street, passing through the foreground and midground. The rider, wearing a helmet, continues along the left side of the road, gradually receding into the distance while the surrounding street scene remains static from the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a bustling street at night, illuminated by numerous colorful Korean neon signs on shopfronts lining both the left and right sides, extending into the background. In the immediate foreground to the left, a blue vertical '부동산' (real estate) sign is angled towards the viewer, alongside other yellow glowing signs further up. The asphalt road, featuring a manhole in the mid-ground, shows a scooter and pedestrians moving away from the viewer in the distance, while a prominent 'Sowan' shop with large display windows occupies the mid-right.
end of description
Subsequently, several pedestrians move throughout the scene; a pair on the right sidewalk steadily walks closer to the viewer, one carrying an open umbrella. Concurrently, the scooter and a lone pedestrian in the middle of the street continue to move further away, receding into the background relative to the static viewpoint. No new objects or scenes are revealed, only the movement of existing elements.

The first frame depicts a bustling urban street at night, viewed looking forward down a narrow road lined with glowing signs and storefronts. On the left, brightly lit shops with glass windows displaying food and numerous vertical and horizontal Korean signs (some in red and orange) extend into the background. On the right, similar illuminated shops, including "Suwan Cafe & Bakery," also recede into the distance, adorned with yellow, blue, and white Korean signs. In the immediate foreground on the right, two women are partially visible, one holding an open, patterned umbrella. Pedestrians are scattered along both sidewalks and the street into the midground, with faint vehicle lights visible further down the dark street.

end of description

The two women initially in the foreground on the right progressively walk further down the street and away from the viewer. Concurrently, a new female pedestrian appears from the mid-right sidewalk, gradually walking towards the viewer. Other pedestrians along both sides of the street also exhibit continuous movement, generally receding into the background. The street and buildings maintain their fixed spatial positions relative to the viewer as these dynamic changes unfold.

To the right, another series of stores exhibits merchandise, including what appears to be artificial flowers, under glowing awnings and signs. Further down the street, several pedestrians are visible walking in the mid-ground, with more distant lights and buildings receding towards the horizon under a dark sky, and a "SEOUL WALKER" watermark appears in the bottom left.
end of description
The camera steadily moves forward along the street, causing elements initially in the mid-ground to advance closer to the viewer. The person in the black jacket and jeans, previously in the mid-ground, walks directly towards the viewer, eventually passing into the immediate foreground and slightly to the left. Other pedestrians further down the street also continue their movement, maintaining the dynamic, bustling atmosphere of the night market scene.
