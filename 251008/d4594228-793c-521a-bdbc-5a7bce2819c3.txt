In the first frame, a night urban scene features a river flowing towards an illuminated orange bridge and distant city buildings. A metal railing lines the immediate foreground right, beside a sidewalk, while a paved path along the left riverbank is bordered by a lit stone wall and buildings, with a solitary figure sitting on a rock in the river.

As the frames progress, the view slowly pans right, revealing more of the river's right bank and gradually shifting the left side of the scene further left. A red bus moves left across the orange bridge, and pedestrians are observed moving along both riverbank paths. A "SEOUL" watermark appears in the bottom left corner in the final frame.
