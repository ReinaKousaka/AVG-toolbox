In the first frame, two green folding chairs are positioned in the lower-left, beneath a blue canopy. To their right, two young males walk towards the right, with a black van partially visible behind them. Along the left side of the street, several white market stalls are set up, one prominently displaying a red-draped table with a large drink dispenser. Numerous people fill the midground, walking away from the viewer down the street, which is flanked by tall city buildings in the background.

As the frames progress, the two young males on the right walk further to the right and out of the frame. Simultaneously, the black van on the right side of the street moves forward, eventually dominating the mid-right portion of the view before also exiting the frame. The crowd of people in the street ahead of the viewer continues to advance further down the street.

In the first frame, a bustling city street scene is visible. To the left foreground, a white vendor tent shelters a red table displaying large beverage dispensers, attended by a person. To the right foreground, the front wheel and side of a dark blue van are partially visible. The midground is filled with numerous pedestrians walking down the street, mostly towards the viewer. In the background, tall city buildings line both sides of the street, with more market tents further down, and an overcast sky is visible above.

In subsequent frames, the pedestrians in the midground continuously walk forward, approaching the viewer. The dark blue van on the right remains stationary relative to the viewer. A man in a dark t-shirt and denim shorts, initially in the mid-right, moves towards the viewer's center, extending his right hand by the final frames. Another man in a grey t-shirt, initially to the right of the first man, also steadily advances closer to the viewer. The overall crowd composition continuously shifts as individuals pass the vendor stalls on the left and traverse the street.
