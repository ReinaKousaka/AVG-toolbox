A tall mirror reflects a lamp, positioned left of two white armchairs that frame a small wooden table holding a boot sculpture and a "TOM FORD" book. In the background, windows with white shutters are flanked by dark curtains, while a dresser with a mirror and decorative items stands to the right, with part of a bed visible in the foreground right.
