The first frame displays a bustling, well-lit cobblestone street at night, bordered by multi-story, colorful buildings on both sides featuring illuminated windows and visible storefronts, including "SWAROVSKI" on the right and a "PRAŽSKÝ INSTITUT" banner. Numerous pedestrians are walking across the street, some heading away from the viewer into the distant background, others moving towards the viewer, and various groups along the sides.
end of description.
In subsequent frames, the pedestrians continuously shift positions; the central couple (man in dark jacket, woman in red coat) steadily walks further away from the viewer into the scene, while other individuals on the left and right sides move past the viewer and deeper into the street, maintaining a constant flow of activity. No new objects or scenes are revealed, only the dynamic repositioning of the moving crowd.

The first frame displays a bustling cobblestone street at night, lined with illuminated multi-story buildings, including one with "SWAROVSKI" and "POLSKI INSTYTUT" signage in the mid-ground right. Numerous pedestrians occupy the foreground and mid-ground, with a man partially visible on the far left, a couple in the center walking away, and others on the right walking towards the viewer.
end of description
Pedestrians dynamically move across the scene: the man on the far left of the first frame exits further left, and the central couple continues walking away from the viewer. Other individuals emerge from the mid-ground, moving horizontally across the street, while those on the right pass closer to the first-frame viewpoint. Notably, a young girl with a white cane emerges from the mid-ground right, traversing towards the center-left, becoming more prominent in the later frames.
