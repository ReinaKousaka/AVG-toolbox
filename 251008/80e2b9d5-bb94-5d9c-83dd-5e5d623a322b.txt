In the first frame, two large scaffolding structures with blue and teal patterned display screens dominate the midground to the left and center. Metal barriers stretch across the foreground over a green turf, while a person's back is visible at the far right; in the background, a building, crane, and skyscraper are visible to the right of the structures against a twilight sky.

Throughout subsequent frames, the person on the far right walks away from the viewer, gradually exiting the frame to the right. Concurrently, the display screens' patterns dynamically shift, introducing red and purple hues that become visible in the gap between the structures and across the screens, as the viewpoint slightly pans right.
