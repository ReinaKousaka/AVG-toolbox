The viewer is positioned on a wet, reflective city sidewalk, with a low hedge and parked cars bordering a park area to the left, and a busy street on the right. Across the street, tall buildings rise under a cloudy sky, while a lamppost and street signs are visible along the right sidewalk, and various vehicles and pedestrians occupy the street ahead.

In subsequent frames, vehicles, including a white van and yellow taxis, continue to move forward and further away from the viewer on the street, while pedestrians in the midground walk from left to right across the street. A cyclist also appears on the right side of the street, riding away from the viewer and passing the lamppost towards the background.

A wet, reflective tiled sidewalk dominates the foreground, extending towards the mid-ground. To the left, a raised planter box borders a grassy park area with trees, benches, parked cars, and a golden statue partially visible among the foliage. To the right, a multi-lane wet street is visible with various cars, pedestrians holding umbrellas, a bicyclist, and street furniture like lampposts and traffic signals. Tall city buildings with some scaffolding line the right side of the street in the background, under an overcast grey sky.

A person holding a black umbrella walks towards the viewer on the central sidewalk, progressively nearing the foreground. Simultaneously, a bicyclist in a yellow jacket moves from the far mid-ground across the street to the right and eventually exits the frame. Various cars, including a white SUV and a yellow taxi, move across the wet street in the mid-ground, some passing from right to left and others from left to right.
