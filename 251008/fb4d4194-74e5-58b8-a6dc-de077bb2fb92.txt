The first frame shows a narrow, cobbled street bordered by buildings. To the left, a yellow building with arched window decorations made of plastic bottles sits above dark green shop displays. Opposite, a "SWAROVSKI" store with a prominent glass front occupies the right side. A lone person walks away from the viewer down the center of the street towards the distant, narrowing alley.
end of description
The camera steadily moves forward along the street, causing the initial sections of the yellow building on the left and the Swarovski store on the right to grow larger before receding out of the original first-frame view. The person continues to walk further away from the viewer, deeper into the progressively revealed street ahead.
