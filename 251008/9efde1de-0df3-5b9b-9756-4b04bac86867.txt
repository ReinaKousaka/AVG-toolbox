The first frame displays a snowy village street scene in Engelberg, Switzerland. In the immediate foreground to the right, an illuminated wire-frame sleigh pulled by two wire-frame horses, all adorned with fairy lights, rests on a patch of snow next to a building. This building, running along the midground to the right, is a dark-timbered "Hotel Spannort Restaurant" with multiple windows, some decorated with garlands. To the left, a snow-covered street extends into the background, where several pedestrians walk away from the viewer, and parked cars are visible further down. Towering snow-covered mountains rise in the far background to the left, and a dark, indistinct cloud-like anomaly is present in the upper-left sky.
end of description
The indistinct dark anomaly in the upper-left of the first frame quickly vanishes. It then reappears as a dark bird, flying downwards and to the right across the distant mountains, eventually moving out of the upper-left frame entirely. Subsequently, a different bird is revealed flying horizontally from the far left across the mid-ground mountainous landscape, continuing towards the center-left. Concurrently, several pedestrians on the left foreground continue walking away from the viewer down the snow-covered street throughout the sequence.
