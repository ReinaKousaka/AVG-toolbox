The first frame captures a bustling city sidewalk. In the immediate foreground, the backs of individuals with blonde hair in a black coat and another in a blue jacket with a black backpack are on the right, while a person in a red top, a white cap, and a gray hoodie are on the left, all walking away. The midground is filled with various pedestrians, with glass-fronted buildings on the left and tall city buildings, cars, and a distant "Indiana" billboard on the right.

The following frames show the viewpoint continuously moving forward along the sidewalk. Individuals previously in the foreground left pass by and exit the frame, while new pedestrians emerge from the left, also moving past the viewer. Concurrently, cars on the right-side street continue their movement, and a distant billboard on a tall building, initially displaying "Indiana," changes to "Berklee College," while the overall spatial arrangement of buildings remains consistent relative to the moving viewer.
