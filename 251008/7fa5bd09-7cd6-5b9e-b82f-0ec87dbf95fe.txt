The first frame shows a village street scene nestled against a large, green, rocky mountain in the background. To the far left, a stone building with a "Hotel" sign, black awning, and outdoor seating dominates the foreground. A street with a white crosswalk and a parked orange scooter occupies the center-right foreground, while a silver SUV is parked further down the road. In the mid-ground, a larger building with an orange tiled roof and a person in a white shirt and red shorts with a small white dog stand to the left, with other buildings, including a prominent yellow one, extending towards the right.

end of description
The viewpoint steadily pans to the right, gradually moving the hotel building on the far left out of frame. As the camera pans, the street and parking area in the center become more expansive, while the pedestrian with the small white dog, initially to the left of the orange scooter, walks progressively further right across the mid-ground. The yellow building, initially on the far right, becomes more centered, revealing more of the road extending behind its first-frame position. Concurrently, the large building with the orange tiled roof, originally in the mid-ground left, also shifts out of the frame's left edge.
