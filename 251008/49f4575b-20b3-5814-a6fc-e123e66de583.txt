The first frame depicts a bustling indoor market aisle, viewed from behind several pedestrians walking forward. In the immediate foreground, the backs of individuals in dark clothing move away, with a man and woman conversing to the left. The narrow aisle is lined with numerous stalls: the left side features white containers and blue signs with Korean text, possibly a fish market, while the right side displays an array of household goods under a prominent "한국 기물" sign. The crowded passageway recedes into the brightly lit background, under a white ceiling with visible brickwork above.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily progresses forward through the market aisle. As the viewer advances, the initial foreground individuals move further away, revealing new sections of the crowded market ahead. Objects on the stalls, initially in the mid-ground, sequentially shift closer to and then past the viewer, with specific signs like "한국 기물" and "삼우수산" moving progressively closer and across the frame relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The continuous forward motion unfolds more of the deep, bustling market extending further into the distance.
