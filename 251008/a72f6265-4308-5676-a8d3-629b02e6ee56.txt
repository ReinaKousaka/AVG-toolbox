The first frame displays a narrow, wet stone-paved alley leading into the distance, with a utility pole occupying the right foreground, partially obscuring a dark SUV and a brick building beyond it; to the left stands a brick building with an ADT sign and a white garage-like gate.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the alley, the utility pole gradually moves out of the frame to the right, fully revealing the parked dark SUV and more of the brick building with silver pipes running along its side. Simultaneously, more of the buildings on the left, including the brick facade and the white gate, come into full view, while a blue object appears at the top-left, indicating the camera's forward and slightly left movement.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame presents a wet, paved alleyway extending into the distance under an overcast sky. To the immediate left, a brick building with a dark gate is partially visible, followed by a white roll-up garage door set into a brick wall further down the alley. On the right, a dark grey SUV is parked, facing away from the viewer, alongside a sidewalk strip. Behind the SUV, a multi-story brick building features several windows, air conditioning units, and prominent curved metallic pipes running vertically up its facade. In the background, the alley is lined with more buildings and utility poles crisscrossed with wires.
end of description
A blue umbrella or canopy gradually emerges from the top-left, progressively obscuring that corner as it moves into the frame, positioned above the viewer's immediate left. Subsequently, the viewpoint slowly shifts forward and slightly to the right within the alley. As the viewpoint moves, the number '7' on the brick wall to the left becomes more visible, and the dark grey SUV's taillights briefly illuminate before turning off again.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a narrow, wet alleyway receding from the viewer, bordered by buildings. On the left, a brick wall with a white garage door extends into the distance, with a blue sign bearing the number '7' visible near the viewer. To the right, a dark SUV is parked beside a brick building featuring multiple large silver ventilation pipes extending diagonally upwards to the left, with green foliage and a doorway below them.
end of description
Subsequent frames reveal almost no dynamic changes; however, a small blue cap or sensor subtly appears above the top-left corner of the garage door in the later frames, becoming more clearly discernible.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a wet, paved alleyway receding under an overcast sky. To the left, a white garage door and brick wall are visible, with a traditional Korean roof beyond, while on the right, a dark grey SUV is parked beside a brick building featuring metallic ventilation ducts and green bushes.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the camera subtly shifts rightward, causing a slight expansion of the scene to the right of the parked SUV and the brick building's facade, while proportionally narrowing the view of the garage door on the left. No new objects or distinct scenes are revealed as the environment remains static relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a wet, paved alleyway extending into the distance under an overcast sky, with buildings lining both sides. To the immediate left is a large white garage door next to a brick wall, while further left a traditional tiled roof is visible. On the right, the rear of a dark grey car is parked in the foreground beside a brick building featuring a dark door, silver exhaust pipes, gas meters, and a raised planter filled with green bushes.
end of description
As the camera moves forward through the subsequent frames, the parked car on the front-right moves out of view. The white garage door on the left also recedes and exits the frame, revealing more of the brick wall and the alley's path ahead. The brick building on the right and the architecture deeper into the alley become more prominent and central as the viewpoint progresses.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The initial frame shows a wet, paved alleyway flanked by buildings under an overcast sky. To the left, a white garage door with an ADT logo sits beside a brick wall, topped by a traditional Korean roof in the mid-ground. On the right, a brick building with utility pipes displays a foreground planter of green bushes and colorful bins further ahead.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly progresses forward down the alley. As the camera advances, the garage door and left wall recede and move out of frame to the left, while the planter and bins on the right also recede and move towards the right edge, continually revealing more of the path ahead.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a wet, narrow alleyway extending into the distance under an overcast sky. To the immediate left is a brick wall with a low yellowish section and an ornate metal fence, followed by a white pillar and a grey building facade further down. On the right, a brick building features a long horizontal corrugated metal pipe above a planter box filled with green bushes, with yellow and blue bins standing on the pavement in front of it. Overhead, numerous electrical wires are strung across the alley, which eventually curves slightly into the background.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward along the alley. The prominent brick wall on the immediate left recedes behind the viewer, revealing more of the white pillar and the grey building facade which now occupy the closer left side. The brick building on the right, along with its corrugated pipes and planter box, also recedes as new sections of buildings further down the alley appear ahead of the original viewpoint. The yellow and blue bins on the right move from being immediately beside the viewer to further ahead and eventually behind the original viewpoint as the path is traversed.
