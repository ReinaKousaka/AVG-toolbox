The first frame presents a night scene looking down a wet street. In the immediate foreground, the road stretches ahead, flanked by a black metal fence on the left and the front of a white car on the right. Further along the left, trees, more parked vehicles, and a building with a brightly lit '优悦酒店' sign are visible. On the right, a row of parked cars lines the curb in front of a multi-story building with illuminated windows. Centrally positioned above the street in the midground is a blue overhead sign displaying street names, leading to a prominent, ornate yellow-lit building in the background under a dark sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the trees in the foreground gradually shift past, revealing more of the street and buildings behind them on both sides. The parked cars on the right become more visible before moving out of frame as the viewer passes them. The blue street sign and the illuminated building in the distance consistently grow larger, indicating approach. In later frames, a motorcycle becomes visible on the far left, traveling towards the viewer.

The first frame depicts a night street scene looking down a wet road towards an illuminated building with a prominent clock tower straight ahead, flanked by trees and multi-story buildings on either side. Parked cars line both sides of the road, and a blue street sign hangs overhead in the midground, along with a red no-stopping sign on the left.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the overhead street sign moves upwards and out of view, and the buildings and trees on the sides appear to recede past the viewer. A pedestrian in a light-colored jacket is revealed walking across the street from left to right in the midground, while the central illuminated building approaches, revealing more architectural details.

In the first frame, a night street scene is viewed from a low angle, with a paved road extending into the distance. Rows of parked cars line both the left and right sides of the road, partially obscured by trees that frame the view from above. On the near left, a black ornamental fence runs parallel to the road, with a red circular no-parking sign and a green street sign visible immediately above it. In the midground, a large, illuminated building featuring a prominent clock tower and distinctive gabled architecture stands centrally at the end of the road. To the far right, a taller building with illuminated windows rises under the dark night sky.

end of description

Beginning in the second frame, a person wearing a bright yellow safety vest emerges from the far left of the first-frame viewpoint, walking along the roadside behind the black fence. This individual proceeds to move from left to right across the foreground, steadily walking towards the right side. The person continues to advance past the initial position of the no-parking sign and further into the right portion of the frame. The individual eventually exits the scene towards the far right.

The first frame displays a nighttime street scene featuring a brightly illuminated, ornate building with a central clock tower in the middle distance, flanked by parked cars on both the left (behind a black metal fence in the foreground) and right sides, with trees and streetlights lining the road.
end of description
As the viewpoint subtly advances, a person emerges from the left and walks across the crosswalk directly ahead of the original perspective, moving towards the right. Simultaneously, a dark van positioned near the center of the street in the initial frame slowly advances forward.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a large, illuminated building with a prominent central clock tower stands in the background, centrally positioned. To its right, an arched structure connects to more of the building, with a small white booth near its entrance and a leafy tree on the far right. To the left, the building continues with some trees in front, and a tall dark pole is visible on the far left in the foreground. In the midground, a street runs horizontally across the frame with white road markings; two cars (a dark van and a blue sedan) are parked on the far side, and a pedestrian walks left-to-right on a crosswalk. In the immediate foreground on the left, a black metal railing runs along a pavement line, behind which several cars are parked.
end of description
The pedestrian in the midground continues to walk from left to right across the crosswalk, moving past the parked dark van and further towards the right side of the frame. Concurrently, the white van on the far right in the midground subtly shifts, revealing slightly more of its front bumper in later frames. Towards the end of the sequence, a green street sign on the tall dark pole in the far left foreground becomes more distinctly visible.

The first frame depicts a large, brightly lit building with a central clock tower in the background at night. In the mid-ground, two people are walking left to right across a zebra crossing, with parked cars (a white SUV, a grey van, and a dark blue car) behind them, and a partial white car, a black railing, and a green street sign visible in the left foreground. end of description The subsequent frames show these two individuals continuing their walk from left to right across the crosswalk, progressing further away from the viewer's left and closer to the right side of the street, while all other objects remain stationary in their initial spatial positions relative to the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a brightly lit European-style building with a central clock tower in the background, set against a dark night sky. In the midground, a street holds four parked cars (dark red, white, grey van, dark blue) behind a black fence, while two pedestrians walk left across a crosswalk in the immediate foreground, partially obscuring the rightmost vehicle.
end of description
The two pedestrians continue walking left across the crosswalk, progressively revealing the dark blue sedan and the street behind them. They then fully exit the frame to the viewer's left, leaving the entire row of parked cars and the illuminated building completely visible.
