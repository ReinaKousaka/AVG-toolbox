A blue-grey horizontally striped wallpaper covers the background. On the upper left, a rectangular framed artwork with a dark ornate frame displays a colorful miniature painting of figures with an animal. To its right and slightly lower, a larger square framed artwork with a black frame and white mat exhibits an abstract colorful watercolor. A green and white ceramic foo dog figurine, resting on a dark red block, is partially visible in the bottom left below the smaller framed artwork.

As the viewpoint shifts down and to the left, a third framed artwork with a dark abstract painting appears centered below the large artwork on the right. Concurrently, a white decorative wall bracket emerges below the green foo dog, which is now fully revealed to be sitting on it. Further to the left, an ornate gilded oval mirror comes into view, reflecting a couch. Simultaneously, from the top right, a long, draped, light-colored object descends, revealing a pleated lampshade with a brass fitting to the right of the larger abstract painting.
