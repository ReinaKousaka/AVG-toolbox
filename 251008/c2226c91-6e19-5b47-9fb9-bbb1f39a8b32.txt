The first frame shows a narrow, cobbled street with old, light-colored buildings on both sides, leading uphill towards a bright sky. A dark scooter is visible in the foreground left, while red construction netting, scaffolding, and a traffic cone occupy the foreground right; a black SUV is parked further down the street on the left, next to potted plants.
end of description
As the camera progresses forward along the street, the scooter, netting, scaffolding, and cone disappear from the immediate foreground. Buildings on both sides, initially in the midground, are revealed in greater detail, with newly visible doorways and a clothesline laden with laundry hanging from a window on the left side of the street, further ahead of where the SUV was initially positioned.
