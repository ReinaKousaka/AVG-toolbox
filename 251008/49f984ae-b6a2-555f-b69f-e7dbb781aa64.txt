The first frame depicts a rainy urban night scene from a low vantage point, looking forward onto a wet, reflective paved surface. Several translucent cylindrical pillars stand vertically along the left and right sides of the foreground and mid-ground. In the mid-distance to the left, a yellow box sits near a pillar, with traffic lights visible further down the street. A wide street or intersection extends centrally into the hazy background, marked by faint crosswalk lines and distant vehicle lights. Tall buildings and trees are vaguely discernible in the background, obscured by rain and bright light sources, while prominent lens flares and glare dominate the upper portion of the frame.
end of description
A dark vehicle begins moving rightward across the distant intersection. In subsequent frames, this vehicle becomes clearer as it continues its movement, exiting the frame to the right. Concurrently, a red car emerges from the far right of the distant street, slowly advancing forward. Later, another light-colored vehicle with headlights appears, moving leftward across the distant street.

The first frame displays a wet, nighttime urban scene viewed through a rain-splashed pane. In the foreground, reflective pavement leads to a pedestrian crossing, bordered by clear, cylindrical decorative pillars on the left and partially obscured structures on the right. Beyond the crossing, a street with green traffic lights on the left, distant buildings, and illuminated streetlights are visible, all under a prominent, rainbow-tinted lens flare arching across the view.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, water droplets on the foreground pane continually shift, merge, and run down, dynamically altering the lens flare and light reflections. A white vehicle also briefly moves leftwards on the far right of the distant street in later frames.

The first frame displays a rainy night street scene, centered by a wet crosswalk and intersection. Two translucent cylindrical structures frame the foreground on the left and right, with illuminated traffic lights (green on the left, red on the right) and tall city buildings visible in the midground and background.
end of description. The camera slowly pans to the right, causing the left foreground structure to move out of view from its initial position. Concurrently, new segments of the street, street furniture, and pedestrians from further to the right of the first-frame viewpoint become visible, while elements like the crosswalk shift towards the left relative to their original central placement.
