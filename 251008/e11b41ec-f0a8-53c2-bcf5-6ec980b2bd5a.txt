In the first frame, a large, grey utility box occupies the right foreground, partially obscuring a silver sedan with its headlights on, visible in the mid-right. A wet, brick-paved sidewalk extends from the mid-left towards the background, bordered by a modern building with illuminated shrubbery and large glass panels on the far left. Beyond the sidewalk, a tree-lined street with wet surfaces reflects red and green traffic lights and streetlights, extending into the distant background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the large grey utility box on the right gradually moves out of the frame, revealing the parked silver sedan more fully in the mid-right, its headlights illuminated. The camera effectively pans to the left, causing the viewpoint to shift, showing more of the wet sidewalk extending further into the distance. More of the street and its distant traffic lights become visible to the right of the sidewalk as the obstruction recedes. The heavy rain continues throughout, glistening on all surfaces.
