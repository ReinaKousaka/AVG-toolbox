The first frame captures a dark, kidney-bean-shaped table with a sculptural base, sitting on a light-patterned rug. On the table, from right to left, are a green vase with leaves, a clear ashtray, a decorative box, a small tablet, and some papers.
end of description.
As the frames progress, the camera subtly pans backward, revealing a window seat with cushions behind the table, further back relative to the viewer, against a red-orange wall. Multiple windows become visible, showing an outdoor view of trees, and a colorful patterned curtain appears to the right of the windows. A tall, rectangular lamp with a central cutout also becomes visible on the left side of the table, previously obscured.
