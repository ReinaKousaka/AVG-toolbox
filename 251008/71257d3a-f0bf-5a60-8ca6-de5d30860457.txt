Two people, one with a white umbrella in the mid-ground and another with a blue umbrella further ahead, are walking away from the viewer down the street. end of description The person with the white umbrella subsequently begins to run, swiftly moving past the blue umbrella individual and continuing to sprint further away from the viewer before exiting the frame forward.
