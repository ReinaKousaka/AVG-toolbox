A narrow pedestrian street is seen looking forward, flanked by buildings. On the immediate right, a woman in a pink jacket is walking away from the viewer, while slightly to her left, another woman and a man walk towards the background. To the left, cafe tables with brightly colored chairs are visible, alongside a bicycle and a street lamp attached to a building under scaffolding. Storefronts line the right side of the street, including "Sandro Ferrone," and other pedestrians are visible in the distance.

As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward down the street. The woman in the pink jacket and the couple initially near the viewer move further into the midground and eventually out of the frame, revealing more of the street ahead. The cafe seating and bicycle on the left also recede into the midground. More distant buildings, storefronts, and pedestrians become increasingly clearer as the camera advances forward.

The first frame shows a pedestrian street extending into the distance, bordered on the left by potted plants and colorful chairs in the immediate foreground, followed by construction scaffolding and blue barriers. On the right, commercial storefronts with visible air conditioning units line the midground, as pedestrians walk along the paved street under overhead decorative lights towards distant buildings.

Over subsequent frames, a white table replaces the colorful chairs in the left foreground, while a person emerges behind the blue construction barrier holding a phone. People on the right side, initially in the midground, walk closer towards the viewer, with one man eventually passing into the immediate right foreground and out of frame.
