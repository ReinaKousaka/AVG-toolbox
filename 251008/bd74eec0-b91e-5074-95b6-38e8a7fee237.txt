The first frame depicts a bustling pedestrian street at night, with a paved walkway extending into the distance. To the viewer's immediate left, a tree trunk and a black bollard are visible, followed by an outdoor seating area with tables and chairs, and a building adorned with murals. On the right, a black fence encloses an outdoor dining space featuring black tables and chairs on artificial grass, situated in front of brightly lit buildings with red facades and prominent neon signs like "Heineken" and "Coyote Ugly Saloon." Along the center of the walkway, several bare-branched trees and additional black bollards line the path, where a person in a red and black jacket walks towards the viewer on the left, and another individual in lighter clothing walks further away in the mid-distance.
end of description
The person in the red and black jacket on the left side of the walkway steadily walks closer to the viewer and towards the left edge of the frame, eventually moving partially out of view. Simultaneously, the individual in lighter clothing, initially further down the path, also progresses forward, gradually approaching the first-frame viewpoint along the pathway.

The viewer looks down a pedestrianized street at night, flanked by illuminated storefronts and outdoor seating. On the right, tables and chairs are fenced off, behind which are businesses with red awnings and signs like 'Heineken' and 'Coyote Ugly'. On the left, bare trees line the paved path, with a man in a striped jacket walking towards the viewer in the mid-left and a woman using her phone walking away in the mid-center. Further into the background, signs for 'Greggs' and a prominent yellow 'Coral' are visible.
end of description
The man on the left side of the walkway steadily moves forward, passing the viewer and exiting the frame to the front-left, revealing a new menu board in the front-left. The woman in the mid-center continues walking away from the viewer, gradually moving further into the background along the path. By the seventh frame, she is clearly holding a white shopping bag in her left hand and has turned her head slightly towards the back-left.

The first frame presents a night scene of a paved pedestrian street flanked by buildings. On the right, a dark fence encloses outdoor seating in front of a building with a "ROYAL JUG" sign, while on the left, a blonde woman walks towards the viewer, holding a bag and a cup, past a tree and a building adorned with a mural and a "Riley's" sign. Various illuminated shop signs like "Greggs" and "Craft" are visible further down the street in the mid-ground.
end of description
The blonde woman, initially on the left side of the path, walks towards the viewer. As the frames progress, she continues moving closer, shifting her gaze to a phone she holds in her hands. She then passes the viewer's original position, exiting the frame towards the bottom left, revealing more of the paved path and the purple planters on the left that were partially obscured by her.

The first frame depicts a nighttime street scene with paved ground. To the left, a building houses "Queens" with purple planters and a bollard in the immediate foreground. In the center, a bare tree stands, with a tall, dark statue behind it. Further back, buildings with "Greggs" and "Craft" signs are visible. To the right, an outdoor seating area with dark tables, chairs, and barrel heaters is enclosed by a fence, alongside a building with "Heineken" and other red signs.

end of description

A person initially walking left in the mid-ground, near the leftmost planters, continues moving further left relative to the first-frame viewpoint. They acquire a light-colored bag around the fourth frame, gradually exiting the scene towards the far left. By the last frame, this person has fully moved out of the visible area to the left of the original viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a night-time pedestrian street scene. In the immediate foreground, a tree trunk stands slightly left of center, and to its right, a low wooden fence partially encloses an outdoor seating area with dark tables, chairs, and barrel planters. In the midground, a tall bronze statue of two figures embracing is positioned centrally on the paved walkway, flanked by a building with the neon sign "O'Malley's" and purple barriers to the left, and a building with red awnings and string lights to the right. Further back, businesses like "GREGGS" and "Croft" are visible, with a multi-story building featuring numerous illuminated windows forming the background. Several pedestrians are scattered throughout the midground and background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly moves forward relative to its initial position, causing the foreground paving to extend further. Pedestrians initially in the midground continue to move across the scene, appearing to walk further away from or across the original viewpoint's path. A large American flag poster, previously partially obscured on the right-hand building facade, becomes more prominent and clearer as the camera advances towards it.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a nighttime street scene with a tree trunk prominently in the far left foreground. A person in a dark jacket and mask walks from the left mid-ground towards the viewer, situated near purple barriers. Centrally, a tall bronze sculpture of two embracing figures stands, while behind it, illuminated buildings with "Greggs" and "Craft" signs define the background. To the right, an outdoor seating area with tables and chairs is enclosed by a fence and a red banner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the person on the left moves continuously closer to the viewer and diagonally rightward, eventually passing the tree trunk and approaching the sculpture from its left. This movement increasingly reveals the paved street behind their initial position. All other objects, including the central sculpture, background buildings, and the outdoor seating area on the right, remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A tall, bronze sculpture depicting two embracing figures stands in the center-left foreground on a paved ground. To its immediate right, a low wooden fence borders an outdoor seating area with black tables and chairs, adjacent to a red-fronted building with an American flag-themed facade (Coyote Ugly Saloon) on the far right. Across the street behind the sculpture, the 'Craft' restaurant with illuminated signage is visible, bustling with patrons both inside and outside, and further left, a 'Greggs' store with a dark facade. The background features a multi-story building with numerous illuminated windows and festive string lights draped overhead.
end of description
The camera slowly pans to the right from the first-frame viewpoint, causing all visible objects in the frame to shift leftwards. The bronze sculpture moves further towards the center-left, while the Greggs and Craft establishments gradually move out of view to the far left. Simultaneously, more of the paved street area and the building wall to the right of the 'Coyote Ugly Saloon' are revealed on the right side of the frame. Pedestrians are also observed walking along the street in front of the Craft restaurant, moving left.
