The first frame depicts a night scene on a cobblestone street lined with illuminated multi-story stone buildings. To the left, a building houses "The Amber Restaurant & Bar" with a brightly lit shopfront, and further left, another building partially visible. To the right, a more ornate building features "Old Town Chambers" above its entrance, with street lamps affixed to its facade. Several grey bollards are positioned on the street, closer to the viewer, and the front right corner of a dark car is at the far right edge. Various pedestrians walk from left to right on the cobblestone street in the midground.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the camera subtly pans right and zooms out slightly, widening the view of the street. The pedestrians continue walking from left to right, gradually moving past "The Amber Restaurant & Bar" and exiting the frame towards the right. Concurrently, the dark car on the far right slowly moves out of view, revealing more of the cobblestone pavement where it was positioned.

A dimly lit cobblestone street at night is framed by multi-story stone buildings with illuminated windows and ground-level shops and restaurants, including "ANGELS WITH BAGPIPES" and "OLD TOWN CHAMBERS." Various pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks on both the left and right sides of the street, some standing and others walking.
end of description
In subsequent frames, pedestrians on the left sidewalk move further left, while a group initially on the far right moves left into the midground. A white SUV enters from the far left, proceeds rightward along the street, and passes the walking pedestrians as the individuals near the "ANGELS WITH BAGPIPES" restaurant also shift their positions slightly.
