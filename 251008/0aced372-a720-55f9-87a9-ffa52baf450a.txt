Immediately to the viewer's left are three large Japanese banners (red text on white and yellow backgrounds). To the right, a sidewalk extends forward alongside a building with dark-tiled lower sections, topped by a blue and yellow sign. Ahead, a street contains a stationary black car on the left and a white truck further down, with a pedestrian crossing in the midground, all framed by tall buildings and an overcast sky.

As frames progress, the black car on the left moves forward and exits, while the traffic light above it changes to green. A person on a mobility scooter on the right sidewalk and the white truck in the distance also advance. A new dark taxi-like vehicle appears on the far left and proceeds forward, and an additional banner becomes visible left of the existing ones.

The initial frame presents a city street with a prominent yellow and red banner displaying Japanese text in the left foreground, partially covering a street with a crosswalk and green traffic light leading to distant buildings, while a sidewalk and building with large glass windows occupy the right. A black metal fence and white plastic bag are visible at the banner's base.

Subsequently, the yellow banner sways further left, momentarily revealing more of the street, as a cyclist enters the scene from the left mid-ground, traveling rightwards across the road. The cyclist continues to move towards the right foreground and out of view, while a black taxi simultaneously appears from the left background, also moving towards the viewer along the street.

In the first frame, two large, vertical blue banners displaying Japanese text for "RENT," "SALE," and "MANAGEMENT" are prominently visible in the left foreground, partially obscuring the street beyond. To the right of the banners, a city street extends into the mid-ground, featuring a white pedestrian crosswalk at an intersection and a black taxi (marked 'S.RIDE') moving away in the left lane. Further down the street, a white truck is parked on the right, while a green traffic light hangs above the intersection. On the right side of the frame, a sidewalk with pedestrians walking away leads past the lower levels of a multi-story building featuring storefronts, with an evergreen tree positioned slightly further back on the sidewalk. Tall modern buildings with glass facades and older structures line both sides of the street, stretching into the background under a cloudy sky.

As the video progresses, the camera slowly pans to the right, causing the two blue banners in the foreground to gradually move out of the left side of the frame relative to the first-frame viewpoint. This movement progressively reveals more of the street on the left, including additional building facades, while the black taxi and other vehicles continue to recede further away from the viewer. Simultaneously, the rightmost portion of the street and sidewalk, including pedestrians, becomes more centered in the frame, but no new major objects or scenes are revealed beyond what was initially partially visible to the right.
