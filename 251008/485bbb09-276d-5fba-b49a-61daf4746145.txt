The foreground features a cobblestone road extending towards the center of the frame, bordered on the right by a low stone wall. To the left stands a grey multi-story building with a balcony, while to the right, a light yellow building with brown shutters and a visible sign is present. In the midground, several brown multi-story buildings line the street, housing what appears to be an outdoor dining area with white umbrellas and some people. A street lamp with a green flag bearing a black symbol hangs slightly right of center, and behind the buildings, a tree-covered hill rises under a clear blue sky with scattered white clouds.

In the subsequent frames, the only dynamic change observed is the gentle unfurling and movement of the green flag hanging from the street lamp, positioned in the midground slightly to the right of the center. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the overall static environment remains unchanged.

The first frame shows a cobblestone street curving ahead, bordered by buildings: a grey/yellow one immediately left, a cream building mid-right, and dark wooden structures further ahead. A green flag flies high above the street to the right of center, with a tree-covered hillside in the background. end of description. As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the green flag and its pole shift left and appear higher within the frame. A street sign attached to this pole, initially to the right and partially obscured, becomes fully visible displaying "Post 200 m" as the camera approaches its position.

In the first frame, a cobbled street, curving from the viewer's foreground into the middle distance, is flanked by buildings under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left stands a tall building with light gray and yellow sections, featuring numerous windows with open white shutters. Further down the street, on both sides, are several traditional European-style buildings, some with dark wooden facades and balconies, including one prominent dark brown building in the mid-right displaying Swiss and yellow flags. An outdoor dining area with white umbrellas and seated patrons is visible in front of this building, and a steep, tree-covered hillside rises behind the structures on the right. Distant mountains are faintly discernible on the left horizon.

Following frames primarily show movement of people within the established scene. A man in a dark shirt and shorts walks from the left foreground towards the mid-left background along the sidewalk, while other pedestrians move further down the street. Individuals in the outdoor dining area in the mid-right also subtly shift positions. The viewpoint subtly progresses forward and slightly to the right, revealing marginally more of the right side of the cobbled street and less of the immediate left foreground building.
