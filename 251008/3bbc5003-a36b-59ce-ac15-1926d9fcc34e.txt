In the foreground, a white A-frame sign with Korean text and food images stands slightly right of center, while several people are partially visible at the bottom left and right. To the midground left, a brightly lit storefront with an awning displays "서울공예식," past which numerous pedestrians are walking. Central to the midground is a dark two-story building with large windows, a "원산해" sign, and a barber pole on its corner, fronted by a rack of textiles and more people. To the right, a narrower street leads into the background, lined with shops and clothing displays, with tall modern buildings visible against the sky further back.
end of description
Pedestrians throughout the scene continually move; people initially in the foreground shift further into the midground or exit the frame, while new individuals enter from the left and right, traversing the main street. Others continue walking along the narrower street extending to the right, deeper into the background. No new objects or scenes are revealed, with the visible environment remaining static as only the flow of people changes.
