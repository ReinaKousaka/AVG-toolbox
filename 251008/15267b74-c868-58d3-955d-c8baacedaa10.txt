The first frame shows a wet city street, with two individuals walking from left to right across a crosswalk in the midground, one holding a green umbrella and the other a blue. To the far left, the rear of a white car and a red sign are visible, while a white pick-up truck and a yellow taxi are stationary further back in the center. A white SUV is partially visible on the far right, with buildings and trees lining the background under an overcast sky.

The two individuals with umbrellas continue walking from left to right across the street, moving further away from the first-frame viewpoint, eventually exiting the frame to the right. A new person, holding a black umbrella, subsequently enters the scene from the far right, near the initial position of the white SUV, and proceeds to walk left across the crosswalk towards the viewer's left. All other elements, including the parked vehicles and background buildings, remain stationary relative to their first-frame positions.

The first frame depicts a rainy urban street intersection. In the foreground, the wet asphalt road is marked with white and yellow crosswalk lines. In the midground, a person holding a black umbrella walks left across a crosswalk, positioned in front of a white pickup truck with a black cargo rack, which is parked facing left. To the left of the pickup, a yellow taxi-like vehicle is partially visible next to a white car. Further left, a red barrier, orange traffic cones, and potted plants are situated. In the background, buildings with storefronts and green trees line the street under an overcast sky.

In subsequent frames, the person with the black umbrella continues walking left across the crosswalk, moving towards the mid-left of the scene. Simultaneously, a group of three new individuals, also holding umbrellas, emerges from the background, from behind the yellow vehicle, and begins to cross the street from right to left further into the intersection. The white pickup truck and the yellow vehicle remain stationary throughout the sequence.

The first frame captures a wet street scene under rain, with prominent white and yellow road markings, including a large arrow pointing away from the viewer, on the asphalt. To the left, orange traffic cones and potted green bushes are visible, while a white pickup truck and a white sedan are parked on the right. A person holding a black umbrella is crossing the street from the mid-right, moving away and towards the mid-left, with other pedestrians further back on a crosswalk near a yellow taxi and buildings lining the street.

Throughout the following frames, the person with the black umbrella continues walking across the street, gradually moving further away and towards the left of the frame. The distant pedestrians also progress across the crosswalk, moving further from the initial viewpoint, while the vehicles on the right remain stationary in the continuing rain.
