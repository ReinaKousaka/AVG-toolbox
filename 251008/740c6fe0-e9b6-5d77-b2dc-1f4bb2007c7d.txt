In the first frame, the viewer is on a snowy city sidewalk looking down a street. To the viewer's right, two people walk away along the sidewalk, past a modern building featuring "609 Granville" signage. To the viewer's left, a blue bus is partially visible on the snow-lined road, while a person in a pink coat holding a clear umbrella walks towards the viewer near a central lamp post adorned with colorful banners.
end of description
As frames progress, the two people on the right sidewalk continue walking further away from the viewer, revealing more of the building's facade. Concurrently, the person with the umbrella on the left sidewalk steadily approaches the viewer, moving past the central lamp post, and then eventually moving out of the frame towards the viewer's front-left. The melting snow piles on both the sidewalk and street show subtle changes in their shape and wetness, indicating continued melting.

The first frame captures a snowy city street from a sidewalk perspective, with a prominent utility pole in the central-left foreground and patches of snow on the ground. Two individuals walk away from the viewer on the midground sidewalk, a third person is partially visible further down on the left, and tall buildings with bare trees line both sides of the street.
end of description.
In subsequent frames, the two foreground individuals continue moving further away from the viewer. The third person, previously partially obscured by the pole to the left, becomes fully visible holding an umbrella as they also walk further down the sidewalk. Simultaneously, a bus emerges on the far left street and moves away, while light snow visibly begins to fall across the scene.

The first frame shows a snowy city street from a forward-looking perspective, with a dark pole close on the left and snow along the sidewalk's edge. Three people walk away on the wet sidewalk: one in pink with an umbrella is further left, while two closer figures (one in dark, one in yellow) are to the right, adjacent to modern glass buildings and a 'DAI TAI CAFE' sign.
end of description
As the viewpoint slowly moves forward, the dark pole on the far left gradually exits the frame, revealing more street and snow. All three individuals continue walking away from the viewer, progressing further into the midground and background relative to their initial positions.

First, the frame reveals a wet, snow-dusted city street and sidewalk on an overcast day, flanked by tall buildings. On the right sidewalk, two individuals (one in a dark hoodie, one in a yellow jacket) walk away from the viewer past a caf√© entrance, while further down, a person in a pink jacket holds a white umbrella, with snow lining the curb to the left.
end of description
As the frames progress, all three initially visible individuals continue walking further away from the first-frame viewpoint. Additionally, a new person in a black coat and beanie emerges from the far right edge of the frame, walking past the viewer and then ahead, moving left relative to their initial appearance. Snow continues to fall throughout the scene.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The viewer is on a wet city sidewalk, with patches of snow along the left curb. Immediately in the foreground, slightly to the left, a person in a black coat and hat walks away. Further ahead on the right, two more individuals walk away from the viewer, one in a dark hoodie and the other in a bright yellow puffer jacket, passing a stack of red chairs behind a black railing next to a glass storefront. Across the street to the left, multiple-story buildings line the street, accompanied by bare trees and a lamppost.
end of description
The person in the black coat moves forward and exits the frame to the viewer's left. As the viewpoint advances, the two people ahead and the stack of red chairs on the right shift further into the scene relative to their initial positions. A new pedestrian holding a white umbrella appears in the distance on the left side of the street, moving closer to the first-frame's position. The snowy patches along the left curb become more prominent.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a wet city sidewalk and street under an overcast sky, with patches of snow on the sidewalk to the viewer's left. In the midground, two men walk away from the viewer, one in a dark jacket, the other in a yellow puffer, past a stack of red chairs and a black railing on the right. Further down the left sidewalk, a person with a white umbrella and red coat is visible, alongside bare trees and utility poles, with buildings lining both sides of the street in the background. end of description
As the frames progress, the two men and the person with the umbrella continue moving further away from the viewer along the sidewalk. Light snow begins to fall, becoming more noticeable in the air throughout the sequence, without any significant change in the background or static foreground elements.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a snowy urban street scene from behind two individuals walking away from the viewer. To the left, a tree trunk stands beside a wet sidewalk with piles of snow, bordering a slushy street lined with multi-story buildings. On the right, a modern building with large glass windows and a glass canopy overhead runs parallel to the sidewalk, separated by a black railing. Ahead on the sidewalk, the two main figures, one in a dark hooded jacket and blue jeans, and the other in a yellow puffer jacket, walk forward. Further down the street, on the opposite sidewalk, a person with a red umbrella walks towards the viewer.
end of description
As the viewpoint gradually moves forward, the two main figures continue walking away, receding further into the midground, while light snow perpetually falls. The person with the red umbrella on the opposite sidewalk steadily approaches, eventually passing beyond a prominent utility pole to the left. The wet appearance of the sidewalk and the slush on the street persist, with new sections of the urban environment and distant buildings continually revealed ahead.
