A colorful building with yellow and blue-tiled walls, purple-shuttered windows, and a brightly lit open doorway on the far left dominates the mid-ground. Above, an ornate balcony with yellow railings is visible. To its right, a silver car is parked under a decorative wooden overhang supported by pillars, next to a small light-colored wooden fence and garage doors. In the background, a light blue building with green shutters extends to the right, and a glimpse of a red-orange building is visible behind the car. A street surface occupies the lower foreground.
end of description
The camera gradually zooms in and pans right. The bright open doorway on the far left of the main building slowly moves out of the frame. Consequently, the silver car, the wooden fence, and the garage doors become more central and slightly larger. More of the distant red-orange building behind the garage is progressively revealed.
