The first frame presents an aerial view of a picturesque town. In the foreground to the right, a large, light-colored castle-like building with prominent red roofs and a tall spired tower stands on a green, ivy-clad cliff overlooking a dark green river that flows towards the viewer's lower left. Across the river, in the mid-ground, a bridge spans the water, with a steep, rocky, tree-covered cliff rising on the opposite bank. To the left of this cliff, several multi-story white buildings with red roofs are visible along the riverbank, and further into the background, widespread residential areas with red-roofed houses extend across rolling green hills.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly pulls back and subtly shifts to the viewer's left, progressively revealing more of the residential areas and infrastructure that were previously to the left and slightly behind the initial frame. The castle and river remain visible but occupy a slightly smaller portion of the expanding scene.
