The first frame displays an urban intersection under an overcast sky. A partially visible black SUV is in the lower right foreground, with white crosswalk lines spanning the central road. To the left, a white building, parked truck, pedestrians, and a white car are visible, while the right features storefronts obscured by trees and a red circular sign. In the midground intersection, a green truck, buses, and a dark SUV turning right are present, with a navigation overlay in the top-left.

As frames progress, the foreground black SUV slightly shifts position relative to the viewer, while the top-left navigation overlay dynamically updates its route arrow, text, and a blinking hazard indicator, with all other midground and background elements remaining stationary.

The first frame displays a street intersection under an overcast sky, with white pedestrian crosswalk lines and yellow cross-hatch road markings prominent in the foreground. In the midground, a dark SUV is positioned slightly right of center on the road, with a green truck and a green and blue bus to its left, appearing stationary. To the far right, a person on a scooter is visible, and a white car is parked on the far left. The midground is flanked by buildings with shops and green trees along the sidewalks, including a multi-story building on the right, while the background reveals distant city structures. A navigation overlay occupies the top-left corner.

Following the initial frame, the dark SUV in the midground begins to turn slightly right and advance forward. Simultaneously, the green truck to its left also starts to move forward from its original position. The bus next to the truck and the scooter on the far right remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint, and no new objects or scenes are revealed.

The first frame displays an urban street scene from a vehicle's perspective. In the foreground, yellow crosshatch road markings are visible on the asphalt directly ahead. To the left, a light blue and green bus is partially seen, followed by a prominent green dump truck in the center-left. Further down the road in the center is a dark SUV. On the right, a sidewalk features storefronts, parked motorbikes, and potted plants, with the front corner of a black car visible at the far right. Overhead, a blue directional road sign is mounted, while a mix of residential and modern buildings, along with numerous trees, line the street under an overcast sky. Navigation UI elements are overlaid in the top-left.

Subsequently, the green dump truck on the left begins a right turn, advancing forward and revealing its side and eventually its rear. The dark SUV ahead of it also moves forward, slightly shifting right, while a light-colored scooter emerges from behind the SUV and proceeds forward in the lane to the right. Concurrently, a black car on the viewer's immediate right becomes progressively more visible, showing its front right side. The blue bus on the far left also progresses forward, indicating the viewer's vehicle is in motion.

From a vehicle's perspective, a large green truck occupies the immediate left foreground, while a black car's front is to the right. A crosswalk is directly ahead, beyond which a dark SUV, a scooter, a yellow taxi, and a blue bus proceed down the multi-lane city street. Buildings, lush trees, and a blue directional street sign line the right side, with a distant skyscraper on the left, all under an overcast sky with a navigation overlay in the top-left.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the green truck shifts left and disappears, revealing a second scooter alongside the first, with the taxi and bus on the left lane further ahead. The blue street sign and zebra crossing recede towards the background and eventually exit the frame to the upper right as buildings and trees appear closer on both sides. A new red/orange sign becomes visible on a building further down the right side, as the overall perspective slightly shifts right, revealing more of the main road ahead.
