The first frame displays a wide cobblestone street flanked by multi-story buildings with arched ground-floor walkways extending into the midground; the left building features green window shutters and two bicycles leaning against a pillar in the foreground, while the right building presents a grander arcade. A stone fountain stands centrally in the midground, with parked cars and a few distant pedestrians further down the street, all under a blue sky with white clouds.

No dynamic changes, newly revealed objects, or scenes are observed across the subsequent frames; the sequence appears to consist of identical still images.

The first frame displays a cobblestone street flanked by multi-story buildings with arched ground-floor walkways, extending into the distance under a blue, cloudy sky. On the left, two bicycles and a scooter are parked next to a red circular sign on a pillar, while the right features a similar building with arches and a distant passageway. A small stone fountain is positioned in the mid-ground center of the street.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward, causing the red circular sign on the left to appear slightly closer to the viewer. Concurrently, shadows on the cobblestone street incrementally lengthen and move towards the viewer's right, indicating the passage of time.

The first frame presents a cobblestone street flanked by multi-story buildings with arched ground-floor passageways under a bright blue sky. To the far left, a blue bicycle is parked, near a red and white sign, while a smaller bicycle rests near the left building's archway. A stone fountain stands in the mid-ground center of the street, with a yellow car visible through an archway of the building on the right.
end of description
The following frames are largely static until, from the seventh frame onwards, a person emerges from beneath the archway of the building on the right, in the mid-ground, and proceeds to walk towards the viewer's right.

The first frame presents a view down a cobbled street flanked by multi-story, light-colored buildings with ground-level arcades on both the left and right sides. A bicycle is parked against an arcade column on the immediate left, and another is visible further down under the arcade on the right. In the mid-ground, a stone fountain with a statue stands centrally on the cobblestones, with several cars parked further down the street beyond it, all under a blue sky with white clouds.
end of description
A person's shadow appears on the cobblestones to the right of the fountain, moving leftward. Subsequently, a person on a bicycle emerges from beneath the right-side arcade in the mid-ground, beginning to cycle towards the viewer's right. This cyclist continues moving from the mid-ground towards the foreground on the right side of the street.

The first frame shows a cobblestone street flanked by multi-story buildings under a blue sky. On the right, a cyclist approaches, while a parked bicycle rests near arched buildings on the left. A stone fountain stands in the street's center, with a person walking behind it further into the background. end of description. Subsequently, the cyclist on the right rides progressively closer to the viewer, while the person walking in the mid-background moves from left to right, eventually exiting the frame behind the building on the right. The cyclist continues towards and then past the viewer on the right, with only their rear wheel visible in the final frame as they exit to the right.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The scene displays a cobblestone street extending away from the viewer, lined on both sides by multi-story buildings under a partly cloudy sky. To the left, a light greyish building features arched ground-floor colonnades and green window shutters, with a bicycle parked in the immediate foreground. On the right, a yellowish building presents an arched entrance, balconies, and a green door; a person is walking towards this archway. A stone fountain with a lower basin stands centrally in the mid-ground, with several cars parked further down the street between the buildings.
end of description
The person on the right side of the street is seen walking progressively deeper into the arched entrance of the building, moving further away from the viewer's initial position. Over the subsequent frames, they continue to recede into this archway on the right, becoming less distinct as they move deeper inside.
