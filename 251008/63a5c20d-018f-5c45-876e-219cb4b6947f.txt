The first frame presents a wet asphalt road with a yellow-lined curb prominent on the bottom left, adjacent to a brick wall and a striped utility pole. To the right, a multi-story apartment building with numerous windows and balconies occupies the midground, with another building partially visible behind it further right. The road extends forward, curving into a path on the left and a wider street on the right, all under an overcast sky with scattered trees and bushes.

Beginning in the fifth frame, a white electric scooter gradually appears, revealing itself to be lying on its side on the ground to the left of the frame, next to the striped utility pole and the brick wall visible in the initial view.

The first frame presents a wet urban street featuring a prominent yellow and black striped pole in the left foreground, alongside which a white electric scooter lies on the ground. To the left, a brick wall extends into the distance, bordering a narrow paved path, while a multi-story apartment building with a car parked beneath it occupies the right side of the frame.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward and slightly right, the electric scooter exits the frame left, and the pole, now in the mid-ground left, reveals a blinking red light. Further along the left wall, a series of planters with green foliage become visible, and the yellow road line on the right extends further back, while the apartment building and the car within its garage remain on the right.

A yellow pole with black diagonal stripes and a red illuminated '8' is positioned prominently on the immediate left foreground. A wet asphalt street extends directly in front of the viewer, marked by a yellow line on its right side. To the viewer's left, a long brick wall with a concrete base recedes into the distance, fronted by a row of planters containing green plants, with pine trees visible above the wall. On the right, a multi-story apartment building with many windows and balconies stands, featuring an open ground-level parking area where a dark grey car is partially visible, accompanied by an orange cone. The narrow paved alley extends into the background, flanked by buildings and greenery under an overcast sky.
end of description
The camera subtly advances forward. The yellow pole on the viewer's immediate left gradually recedes and exits the frame to the left, with its illuminated number changing from '8' to '9' and then disappearing. Consequently, a blue directional sign, initially obscured by the pole, is revealed on the brick wall further to the viewer's left. The overall perspective slightly widens, progressively unveiling more of the brick wall and the pine trees above it.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a wet, paved alleyway stretching into the distance under an overcast sky. To the left, a long brick wall with a concrete base extends, lined by several green planters and topped by pine trees. To the right, a multi-story apartment building with numerous windows and balconies stands, featuring a covered parking area below where a grey car is partially visible near an orange cone.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the alley, the brick wall and apartment building on either side gradually recede and move out of view from the bottom of the frame, revealing more of the wet pavement ahead. The parked car on the right also moves further away and eventually disappears, while distant trees and structures remain in the background, showing no new revelations.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a wet, paved alleyway stretching away from the viewer, lined on the left by a brick wall with several potted plants at its base, topped by lush trees. To the right stands a multi-story apartment building featuring balconies and large windows, with a drainage grate running parallel to it along the pathway's edge. In the background, the alley narrows, revealing more distant buildings and greenery under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily moves forward along the paved alleyway. The brick wall and the apartment building on the right gradually shift towards the left side of the frame as the viewer advances, with the potted plants on the left appearing to pass by. No new objects are revealed, but the perspective continuously changes as if walking further into the scene.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a wet, brick-paved alleyway extending directly forward from the viewer. To the viewer's left, a long brick wall with a concrete base runs into the distance, with a row of potted plants on its base and trees visible above it. To the viewer's right stands a multi-story white building featuring multiple windows, balconies, and an entrance area with a small white flag hanging near it. In the background, the alley appears to narrow amidst more distant greenery and buildings under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward and slightly to the right, advancing down the alley relative to the initial position. The row of potted plants on the left and the building on the right both appear to shift slightly towards the left side of the frame, growing larger as the viewer approaches them. The foreground paved area recedes, and the section of the white building's entrance on the right becomes more prominent.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a wet, paved alleyway extending into the distance from the viewer. To the left, a long brick wall on a concrete base runs along the alley, fronted by several large planters containing green foliage. Green trees are visible above the wall further along and in the mid-distance, while to the right, a multi-story building with windows and balconies lines the path, featuring a sloped paved entrance to a parking area beneath it.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the alleyway, causing the brick wall and building on the right to progressively approach the viewer, while the planters on the left transition from the foreground to the mid-ground. The sloped entrance on the right reveals more of the underground parking area, eventually showing a white sign with blue text becoming clearer. In later frames, an orange traffic cone appears inside the parking entrance on the right, becoming fully visible as the viewer advances.
