The first frame displays a wide-angle street scene with a multi-lane road extending into the distance in the foreground and mid-ground. To the viewer's left, several cars are parked or moving slowly alongside buildings with bright, illuminated signs. On the right, a sidewalk features pedestrians walking away from the viewer, with a tall, black 'COSMO P' parking sign, marked with a white arrow pointing right, prominently near the viewer's right edge. A towering, cylindrical skyscraper dominates the left background, while other urban buildings line both sides of the street under a light, clear sky.

As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the street. The 'COSMO P' parking sign, initially on the viewer's right, gradually exits the frame to the right. Pedestrians on the right-side sidewalk are passed by the moving viewpoint, with one person in black attire walking off the right side of the frame. The distant buildings and street become closer, revealing more details of the urban environment ahead.

The first frame captures a city street bordered by tall buildings under a hazy sky. On the right, a person walks away on the sidewalk next to a parked blue bicycle, with a building signed "Garden City Hotel" further back, while the left features a multi-lane road with cars, street markings, and more commercial buildings.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward, causing the initial blue bicycle and walker to shift out of view to the rear-right as new sections of the sidewalk and street are revealed ahead. More pedestrians and parked scooters become visible along the right sidewalk, while traffic on the left road continuously changes, with a green taxi prominently emerging and passing in the mid-left. The overall perspective smoothly advances down the urban corridor.
