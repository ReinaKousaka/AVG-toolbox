The first frame depicts a vibrant city street with a wide sidewalk on the right, featuring metal grates and a tree centrally located, alongside buildings with fire escapes lining both sides. To the left, a street with a green bike lane shows a white van receding, a steam pipe emitting vapor near the center-left, and a person walking towards the viewer on the right sidewalk.

As the sequence unfolds, the white van and a newly visible silver car in the street on the left continue moving further away from the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the person on the right sidewalk steadily approaches the viewer, passing the central tree and progressing into the foreground. The steam emanating from the distinctive orange and white pipe in the street's center-left dynamically changes its form and volume.
