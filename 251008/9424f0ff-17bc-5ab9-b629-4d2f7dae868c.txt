The first frame presents a vibrant, multi-colored mural on a building wall, featuring a prominent golden-suited figure with a mustache, arms outstretched; "Faith" is visible on his left arm, while only part of "Infinity" appears on his right. Surrounding him are various portraits and scenes, including figures floating in a blue sky above and cityscapes with faces to his left and below, with a dark building facade showing a partial "CORE" sign to the upper right.

As the camera slowly pans to the right across the frames, more of the extensive mural is revealed to the right of the initial view. The full word "Infinity" on the golden figure's arm becomes completely visible, while a new section with green and brown tones featuring additional portraits emerges further to the right. A distinct female figure with a patterned headwrap, along with more details of the adjacent dark building facade and its "CORE" sign, are progressively uncovered on the far right.
