The first frame shows a bustling city street from a pedestrian's perspective. In the immediate foreground to the right, a large silver pillar adorned with white polka-dots is partially visible. Ahead and slightly to the left of this pillar, a woman in a beige trench coat holding two bags walks away from the viewer. Further to the left and closer to the viewer, a man in a green jacket and a woman in a dark jacket are walking towards the camera on the sidewalk. To the far left, a street with a white van and a yellow taxi runs parallel, lined by tall buildings, and features a traffic light, a "Wrong Way J" sign, and a digital advertising screen displaying KPOP content.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves steadily forward along the sidewalk. The woman in the trench coat continues walking away, while the man and woman initially approaching the viewer pass by on the left side. The patterned pillar on the immediate right gradually moves out of the frame as the camera advances. More of the street and distant buildings, including a street vendor cart and additional pedestrians further down the sidewalk, are revealed ahead and to the left of the original position.

The initial frame displays a city sidewalk with a digital LinkNYC kiosk on the left showcasing KPOP ads, a street with taxis and a food cart, and a dark blue storefront with windows and a menu stand on the right, all populated by several pedestrians, including a woman in a beige coat walking away from the viewer.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the sidewalk, the woman in beige moves further ahead, and a new pedestrian in a red jacket emerges from the far left foreground, passing the original viewpoint along with two other approaching men. The LinkNYC kiosk and the menu stand gradually move out of frame, now behind the viewer's original position, revealing more of the distant street and buildings ahead.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a golden-framed menu board stands in the foreground on the right, angled towards the viewer. To its left, a woman in a red puffer jacket with a patterned bag and a partially visible young man walk away from the viewer on a sidewalk. Further down the sidewalk, a woman in a light trench coat with an umbrella and handbag also walks away. To the left, a street with a black car and a distant yellow taxi is visible, alongside a vendor cart with an orange and white striped awning. Tall buildings line the street under an overcast sky.
end of description
The young man on the left moves out of frame, revealing more of the orange-and-white vendor cart and a man seated next to it, relative to the first-frame viewpoint. A new person in a teal jacket then enters from the far right foreground, moving past the original menu board location. As this new person moves forward, shop windows on the right, initially reflections, reveal more interior details like bottles on shelves. Concurrently, other pedestrians emerge from the left midground, walking towards the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame places the viewer on a city sidewalk behind a person in a grey/teal jacket, who is ahead of a red-jacketed person. To the viewer's left, two men walk towards them past a street vendor cart and traffic, while a storefront with visible bottles and neon signs borders the right.
end of description
As frames progress, the people directly in front of the viewer move forward, and the two men walking towards the viewer on the left pass by and eventually exit the scene to the viewer's left. The street vendor cart, initially on the mid-left, becomes more prominent before receding behind the viewer's forward movement. The storefront on the right remains a constant fixture, with its interior becoming progressively visible from a slightly more advanced position relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a city street with a person in a grey-green coat walking away in the foreground-right, beside a shop window, while a food cart and trash cans occupy the foreground-left. A man on a phone walks towards the viewer in the mid-ground left, and other pedestrians, including one in a blue hoodie, move away down the sidewalk towards distant tall buildings and street traffic.

end of description

From the first-frame viewpoint, the food cart and trash cans move further left and out of view, while new sections of the shop window are revealed further along the right side. The man on the phone approaches and then passes the first-frame viewpoint's left side, continuing to move towards the background left. Meanwhile, the person in the blue hoodie moves closer towards the first-frame viewpoint's initial position along the sidewalk, as the person in the grey-green coat continues to walk further away.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a person wearing a grey and teal long coat walks away from the viewer, positioned centrally in the foreground. To their left and slightly closer, another person in a blue hoodie and yellow head covering walks towards the viewer. To the far left, two black recycling bins are visible next to a sidewalk that borders a street with cars moving away into the midground. On the right, a building with large reflective windows runs parallel to the sidewalk, showing reflections of the street scene. Tall buildings line the street further into the background under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the person in the blue hoodie passes to the left of the initial viewpoint and recedes further into the distance. The primary subject in the grey/teal coat continues walking forward, advancing past the original viewer's position. Concurrently, additional sections of the sidewalk and the storefront facade of the building on the right, previously beyond the right edge of the initial frame, are progressively revealed further ahead. More pedestrians, initially positioned further down the sidewalk relative to the first-frame viewpoint, become visible and either approach or continue ahead. Cars on the street continue their movement away from the initial viewpoint, revealing new vehicles further into the background.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, the viewer looks down a city sidewalk and street. In the immediate foreground, the back of a person wearing a grey-green coat and black backpack walks away from the viewer. To their right, a group of people also walk away, positioned alongside a building with large display windows reflecting the street. To the left, a street with traffic moves away from the viewer, bordered by a green barrier and tall buildings receding into the distance.

end of description

The person in the grey-green coat and the group to their right continue walking away from the first-frame viewpoint as cars on the street also recede. Throughout the sequence, new individuals consistently emerge on the left sidewalk, walking towards the first-frame viewpoint. First, a man in a black cap, then a man in a black hoodie, and a woman in a grey cardigan appear from the left-midground, gradually moving closer. Subsequently, another man in a brown jacket becomes visible further back on the left sidewalk, also approaching the original viewpoint.
