In the first frame, a dark scooter with an orange rear fender is parked in the foreground, partially obscured by a tree trunk on the viewer's right. To the left, a white and red standing sign marks the beginning of a wet tiled sidewalk lined with buildings displaying various signs under awnings. In the midground, a wet asphalt road stretches into the distance, with a white car receding far down the road, flanked by rows of green trees on both sides. A treed hillside rises in the background on the right.

A red and black chair appears on the right side of the road in frame 4, positioned slightly behind and to the left of where the scooter was initially located, near the second tree on the right. This chair remains stationary throughout the subsequent frames. The distant white car continues to recede further down the road, and the rain persists across the entire scene.

The first frame displays a wet street on an overcast, rainy day. To the viewer's left, a prominent red standing sign is positioned near storefronts with various Korean text, a white covered object, and a red brick sidewalk lined with two trees. To the viewer's right, a wet road with painted markings and a black chair holding a red container are visible, leading to a tree-covered hillside in the background.

The camera slowly pans right, causing the red sign and leftmost buildings to move out of view to the viewer's left, while the chair and red container disappear off-frame to the viewer's right. As the pan progresses, a white car emerges from the distant right on the road, moving towards the viewer, and a red banner tied to a utility pole on the sidewalk becomes more fully revealed to the right of the second tree from the viewer's initial left.
