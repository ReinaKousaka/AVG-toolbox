Across subsequent frames, the content on the TV on the right wall dynamically changes, transitioning from a group of people to a man in a suit, then a woman in a red jacket, and finally a woman in a pink shirt. Concurrently, the viewpoint subtly shifts right, revealing a dark doorway leading to a hallway and a staircase railing, previously unseen and located to the right and slightly behind the white armchair.
