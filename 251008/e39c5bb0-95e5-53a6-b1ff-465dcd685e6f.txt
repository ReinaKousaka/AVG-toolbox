In the first frame, a woman with her back to the viewer, wearing a light sweater and plaid pants and holding a red and white bag, stands in the lower-left foreground. To the far right, a large fluted white column partially frames the scene, beyond which lies a paved street extending into the midground and background. On the left side of the street is a two-story building with light green walls and brown windows, while on the right, a corner building features a shop with a dark awning and a brightly lit sign, with other multi-story buildings visible further back.

The woman in the foreground moves towards the left and eventually exits the frame. The group of people initially in the midground walks closer to the viewer and then moves further to the right, passing the illuminated shop. A new male figure emerges from behind the column on the far right and proceeds into the midground. The view subtly expands, revealing more of the building facade to the right of the column that was previously out of sight.

The first frame depicts a paved street leading into a bustling city area, bordered by buildings under clear skies. On the left, a light green building with ornate white trim, dark windows, and a drainpipe is visible. To the right, the edge of a cream building features a sign board and a cluster of potted plants, with a man walking away from the viewer on the far right. In the midground, a corner shop with a red awning and luminous yellow signage attracts several pedestrians, while taller beige residential buildings with multiple balconies and window bars are visible in the background.

In subsequent frames, the man on the far right continues walking left, moving further into the scene past the potted plants. The two women in the center foreground subtly shift forward and pivot slightly towards the corner shop. Concurrently, other pedestrians in the midground adjust their positions, and new individuals gradually emerge from the far right and deeper down the street, all maintaining their relative spatial positions to the initial viewpoint.

The first frame presents a bustling street scene with a light-colored corner building dominating the midground, hosting a shop with bright signage and an awning on its lower level, topped by residential floors with balconies. To the left, a lighter green building frames a receding street, while a large green plant occupies the immediate right foreground. Numerous pedestrians populate the street, moving away from the viewer towards the left.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the people in the right foreground continuously move leftward out of view. Simultaneously, other pedestrians further down the midground street also progress left, altering the crowd's composition relative to the initial scene.
