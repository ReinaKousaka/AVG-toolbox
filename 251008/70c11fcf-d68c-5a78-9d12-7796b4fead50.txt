The first frame shows the viewer on a road with parked cars and a stone retaining wall with foliage on the left, while a yellow building with a garage door and a utility pole are immediately to the right. Further ahead, a black SUV follows a cyclist, with terraced buildings climbing a distant mountain and a distinct lighter building visible on the hillside.

As the viewpoint moves forward, the utility pole and the initial yellow building on the right progressively exit the frame, revealing more of the sidewalk and a decorative gate behind the building, to the right of the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the parked cars on the left move closer and reveal a white van and several other vehicles previously further down the road from the first-frame viewpoint. The black SUV and cyclist ahead also move forward, continuously revealing the road surface ahead of the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame captures a view down a paved road, looking forward. To the viewer's immediate left, a white van and several cars are parked against a stone retaining wall that gives way to a steep, green hillside. Ahead in the driving lane, a dark SUV is visible, followed by a red car further down the road. On the viewer's right, a stone pillar stands beside a light pink building with a dark fence in front, bordering a paved sidewalk. In the mid-ground and background, a large yellow terraced building and an ornate white building are nestled on the hillside, overlooked by a distant mountain peak under a partially cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the white van and the cars parked on the left gradually pass out of frame to the viewer's left. Simultaneously, a garage entrance on the building to the right becomes increasingly visible, and a street light pole emerges higher up on the right side of the road. The dark SUV ahead maintains its relative position in front of the viewer, indicating consistent forward movement.

A light blue compact car is parked in the left foreground, followed by a dark blue car and a white van along the left side of a paved road. In the road's center, a black SUV moves away from the viewer, while a light pink building with trash bins occupies the right foreground. To the left is a steep, vegetated hillside, with a large, terraced yellow building visible on a distant mountain above it. A stone retaining wall and a distinctive light yellow building are also present in the midground on the right.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the light blue car, the dark blue car, and the light pink building with trash bins on the right progressively move out of view, passing behind the viewer. Subsequently, the white van and other parked cars on the left become more prominent in the foreground before also moving out of view behind the viewer. The black SUV and other vehicles on the road continue to recede forward, indicating a steady progression through the scene.

In the first frame, a white van and a blue car are parked on the immediate left, beside a road. Further along the left, a line of parked cars fronts a steep, vegetated hillside featuring a stone retaining wall and an ornate yellow building elevated above it. To the viewer's right, a peach-colored building stands prominently. A black SUV drives away from the viewer on the two-lane road ahead.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the white van and blue car, initially on the left, recede behind the first-frame's position. Subsequently, the red SUV and other parked cars that were further down the road on the left in the initial frame approach and then also pass behind the viewer's original position. Simultaneously, the peach-colored building on the right recedes behind the initial viewpoint. The black SUV seen driving ahead continues to move further into the distance relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
