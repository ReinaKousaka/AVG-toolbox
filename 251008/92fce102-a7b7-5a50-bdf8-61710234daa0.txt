A road extends forward into the frame, with a grassy slope, a building, and a distant snow-capped mountain on the far left. To the right, a steep rocky embankment is topped with grass, a wooden fence, and a large tree, while steps lead up from the bottom right. Further down the road, a street light and a 'no parking' sign stand on the left, set against a backdrop of green hills and a blue sky with white clouds.

As the camera moves forward along the road, the rocky embankment and steps on the right pass by towards the bottom right, and a blue object appears beside the building on the far left. Concurrently, the distant mountain and cable cars on the left recede further into the background, becoming smaller relative to the viewer's advancing position.

The first frame displays a paved road extending forward, flanked on the left by a street light pole with two circular signs, green fields, small buildings, and a snow-capped mountain in the distant background. To the right, a stone wall rises with a partial building and a tree above it, while in the mid-ground, a chalet-style building, a cable car pylon, and a single cable car cabin are visible.

end of description

As the viewpoint moves forward, the street light and signs recede to the far left and eventually out of frame, while the stone wall and attached building on the right move past the viewer's original position. Subsequently, two wooden benches appear on the left side of the road, progressing closer to the first-frame viewpoint, as the central chalet, cable car pylon, and its cabin also draw nearer and shift slightly left. Further along the road, more of the chalet-style buildings on the right become visible, and another cable car cabin emerges in the far left of the sky.

The first frame depicts a paved road extending into a mountain village, flanked by a sidewalk and two wooden benches on the left, and a stone retaining wall ascending to a wooden building on the right. In the mid-ground left are houses, green fields, and a cable car pylon with a gondola suspended on wires, all beneath a blue sky with white clouds and distant mountains.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the road. Cable car gondolas traverse the sky from left to right, with a new gondola appearing from the far left, behind the initial pylon. The two benches in the left foreground gradually move out of view to the left, while the stone wall and the base of the buildings on the right become more prominent as the viewer progresses further into the scene.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a paved road extends from the viewer into the distance, flanked on the left by a paved sidewalk and a grassy area featuring two dark wooden benches. On the right, a stone retaining wall rises with a small wooden railing and a grassy slope leading up to a large multi-story house. Two prominent red and white striped barrier-like poles stand vertically on either side of the road in the midground, with a smaller building visible behind the left pole and another large wooden house integrated into the hillside behind the right pole. Further left, beyond the benches, is a traditional wooden house amidst green fields and distant mountains under a blue sky dotted with white clouds. High above, several gondola cabins are suspended by cables, moving from left to right across the sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the red and white striped poles situated centrally along the road begin to lift upwards and move outwards, progressively revealing the path ahead and structures previously partially obscured behind them. A triangular road sign, depicting a worker, becomes fully visible atop the right pole as it continues its ascent. Simultaneously, the gondola cabins positioned in the upper sky maintain their trajectory, consistently moving from the left side of the frame towards the right.

A paved road extends into the distance, flanked on the left by a sidewalk, a grassy area with three wooden benches, and traditional houses with distant mountains beyond. To the right, a partial wooden structure obscures a grey dumpster, with rising grassy slopes, evergreen trees, and more houses visible, all beneath a blue sky with white clouds.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the wooden benches on the left recede and exit the frame, while a street light with a no-parking sign approaches from the mid-left. On the right, the grey dumpster becomes fully visible then moves out of frame, as a white car appears parked on a gravel patch and gradually approaches from the mid-right.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a paved road extending forward beneath a blue sky with white clouds, flanked by green grassy areas and houses. To the viewer's left, a streetlamp with a red 'no stopping' sign stands, while a white SUV is parked on the right, backed by a grassy hill with trees and a wooden fence.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the streetlamp and sign on the left, and the white SUV on the right, gradually recede out of view. A wooden bench then appears on the left sidewalk, in the space previously occupied by the streetlamp, and a small dark signpost becomes visible on the right where the SUV was. The houses and distant landscape continuously approach, revealing two people walking further down the road on the left.
