The first frame depicts a sunny urban street scene featuring a partially visible dark blue pickup truck on the left, next to a sidewalk. In the foreground, a woman holds a phone to photograph another woman posing next to a large blue bear-like 'VIXX' statue on its pedestal, while a red fire hydrant stands in the midground to the right. Further down the sidewalk, a pedestrian walks away from the viewer, with traffic, buildings, and trees populating the midground and background.

Throughout subsequent frames, the woman posing by the statue subtly shifts her posture, and the pedestrian on the sidewalk consistently moves further away from the viewer. Meanwhile, vehicles in the background, including a dark grey SUV and an orange taxi, progressively travel away from the viewer, with new cars entering and exiting the frame.
