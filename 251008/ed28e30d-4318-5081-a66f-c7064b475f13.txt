In the first frame, the viewer looks down a dimly lit, narrow cobblestone street lined with multi-story buildings featuring illuminated shopfronts at night. Directly ahead, a man in a blue jacket with a grey backpack walks away, flanked by another man in a dark jacket holding a blue bag to the right and a partially visible person in light blue on the far left. On the right, a bright "Simit Sarayı" sign with glowing red letters tops a shop with large glass windows, beside which a man in a brown jacket stands; a bicycle is indistinctly visible further right. On the left, several more shops with window displays and a purple cylindrical bin are visible, with a crowd of people further down the street receding into the distance under overhead streetlights.
end of description
The camera continuously moves forward along the street. The partially visible person on the far left rapidly exits the frame to the left. The man with the blue backpack and the man with the blue bag continue walking away from the first-frame viewpoint. A black bicycle on the right, previously indistinct, becomes clearly visible next to the 'Simit Sarayı' entrance as the viewer passes the standing man. As the viewpoint progresses, new sections of shops and buildings on both sides of the street are continuously revealed ahead of the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a wet, brick-paved street at night, looking down a narrow passage lined with brightly lit shopfronts, including "Hunkemöller" on the left and "VAN DENIM" on the right where a bicycle is parked. Two men walk away from the viewer in the midground: one in a blue jacket with a backpack on the left, and another in a dark jacket carrying a blue bag on the right. Further down the street, more pedestrians and buildings recede into the dark background.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the two men in the midground consistently move further away from the first-frame viewpoint, proceeding down the street. Other pedestrians in the background also continue to recede into the distance, while all buildings, shopfronts, and the parked bicycle on the right remain static relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a wet, paved alley extending away from the viewer at night, flanked by brightly lit shops on the left and right, with two main figures walking away in the midground and other pedestrians further down the street.
end of description
As the viewpoint steadily advances, the two main figures continue walking further into the distance, deeper into the alley from their initial midground positions. The storefronts on both sides, initially to the left and right of the viewer, appear to move towards the sides and then progressively behind the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, new sections of the wet pavement and additional pedestrians, previously further ahead, are revealed and become clearer as the camera moves forward.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a brightly lit city street at night, lined with numerous shops on both sides, including "Hunkemöller" on the left and "WAM DENIM" on the right. Many pedestrians populate the street, with two prominent figures in the foreground walking away from the viewer: one wearing a backpack and another carrying a blue bag.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the camera slowly moves forward down the street from the initial first-frame viewpoint. The two foreground pedestrians continue walking further away, receding into the distance, as other pedestrians also move relative to the advancing viewpoint. Consequently, previously distant parts of the street and buildings further ahead become gradually closer and more prominent within the scene.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a brightly lit pedestrian street at night, flanked by shopfronts on both sides, with people walking along a brick-paved path that recedes into the distance. Visible signs include 'Normal' on the left and 'VAM DENIM' on the right, and numerous pedestrians populate the mid-ground and background.
end of description
Following frames show a man on the right, initially in the mid-ground, walking away from the first-frame viewpoint, while two individuals on the left walk towards the viewer. Other pedestrians in the mid-ground and background also shift positions, but no new scenes or major objects are revealed.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a vibrant nighttime street scene, with a brick-paved walkway stretching into the distance, bordered by multi-story buildings featuring illuminated storefronts. In the immediate foreground, a man in a black jacket and a woman in a blue jacket walk towards the viewer on the left, while other pedestrians move away into the midground and background on the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the two people on the left foreground continue walking towards the viewer, becoming more prominent. Concurrently, the other pedestrians in the midground and background subtly shift their positions further down the street or move out of view. A new person in a light brown jacket eventually enters the frame from the far left, joining the flow of people moving towards the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a bustling urban street at night, looking down a pedestrian-only thoroughfare paved with bricks. On the left, a brightly lit storefront labeled "Normal" and "Junkie" displays merchandise, with two young women in casual attire walking towards the viewer in the foreground. On the right, another illuminated shop, possibly "Easy Show," has a golden interior visible through its large windows, and a man with a blue backpack walks away from the viewer towards the background. Numerous other pedestrians populate the midground and distant background, walking in both directions along the street, which is flanked by multi-story buildings and storefronts under a dark night sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the two women in the left foreground continue walking towards the viewer and slightly to the left. Simultaneously, the man in the right midground proceeds further away from the viewer into the distance and slightly to the right. All other pedestrians visible in the midground and background maintain their trajectories, either approaching or receding along the street, relative to the initial viewpoint, without any new objects or scenes being revealed.
