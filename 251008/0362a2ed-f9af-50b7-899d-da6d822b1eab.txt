The first frame displays an asphalt road with a prominent white line along its left edge, curving gently forward and to the left under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. To the left, a forested mountainside rises in the mid-distance, while to the right, a verdant grassy slope ascends towards a small stone shed, with additional trees and houses visible on the higher incline further back.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the road ahead becomes more defined and the objects on the right, such as the grassy slope, the small stone shed, and the trees, grow progressively closer and larger, appearing to shift leftwards in the frame relative to their initial positions. More distant features of the hillside and structures further along the road are gradually brought into clearer view.
