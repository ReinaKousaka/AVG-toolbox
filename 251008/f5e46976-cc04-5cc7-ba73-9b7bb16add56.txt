The first frame displays a paved road curving gently uphill to the left, featuring a metal guardrail on the far left and a stone retaining wall immediately to its right. Lush green trees and vegetation flank both sides of the road, ascending towards a forested background under a cloudy sky. Tall utility poles with overhead lines parallel the road on the right, where a red stop sign is also visible slightly further back than the retaining wall.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the red stop sign and the initial section of the retaining wall on the right recede out of view. The utility poles and overhead lines on the right become closer and more prominent, revealing additional road markers along the right edge that were previously ahead. Eventually, a concrete structure with yellow markings is revealed on the right, where the stone wall ends, as the road continues to curve left.

A paved road with a white dashed line curves slightly to the right in the foreground, flanked by green grass and trees. A distant tree-covered mountain range lies under an overcast sky, with numerous utility poles visible along the right side of the road on a rising grassy bank.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, a secondary road intersecting from the left, along with a red-and-white yield sign, gradually appears more prominently to the viewer's left. Objects previously further down the main road, like a yellow warning sign and reflective markers on the right, advance towards the viewer before passing. The trees and utility poles on both sides continuously recede, moving further back relative to the initial viewpoint as the scene progresses along the road.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a wet asphalt road curving left, bordered by green grass verges and white-and-black roadside markers on the right. A large tree stands on the far left, while on the right verge, a yellow directional sign and a 'bumpy road' warning sign (6.5 km) are visible before a forested hillside with railway catenary poles under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the initial signs and roadside markers on the right move past to the viewer's right. Subsequently, a yellow diamond-shaped sign becomes fully visible on the right verge, further along the path from the original viewpoint, while the railway infrastructure and forested hillside continue to approach.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a grey asphalt road curving towards the right in the foreground, with a solid white line marking its center. Lush green grass and low vegetation line both sides of the road, and two small white-topped posts are visible near the edges. In the midground, a dense green forest covers hillsides on both the left and right, with a series of metallic power line poles extending into the distance along the right side. The background features darker, heavily forested hills under a cloudy sky with patches of blue.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the road and its centerline progress closer and then recede under the viewer, while the grassy verges and marker posts pass by and exit the bottom of the frame. The power line poles on the right side move closer to the viewer and shift horizontally across the frame from right to left. The distant forested hills and sky remain in their background positions as the foreground elements continuously change.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a gray paved road with a white center line, curving gently to the left and receding into the distance from the viewer's perspective. To the left, dense green trees and bushes line the road, while a grassy slope rises to the right, featuring a series of utility poles with overhead wires extending into the background. A large, densely forested mountain range fills the background under a partially overcast sky, and a small white car is visible far down the road around the bend.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the utility poles to the right and the forested hillside in the background progressively approach, revealing more detail. Newly visible roadside delineators appear on the right side of the road, emerging from the distant right and moving closer to the viewer. The distant white car also slowly approaches, increasing slightly in size.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a wet asphalt road with a central white line leading into a forested valley under a cloudy sky. To the left, dense green trees line a rising slope, with a small white car visible far down the road. On the right, a grassy bank parallels the road, featuring utility poles, overhead wires, and distant mountains.
end of description
Subsequently, the small white car on the distant left approaches the viewer, steadily growing larger and revealing itself as a dark gray Peugeot station wagon. This vehicle then passes the viewer on the immediate left, moving from its initial distant position to exiting the scene to the viewer's left.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A paved road with wet patches and a central dashed line stretches from the foreground into the midground, curving gently left. Dense forest lines the road to the left, while a grassy slope with a white marker post in the immediate foreground and several metal power line structures rises to the right. In the distant background, heavily forested hills frame a valley, revealing a dark tunnel entrance and a faint person visible ahead on the road. The sky above is largely cloudy with patches of blue.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances forward along the road, the immediate foreground objects like the marker post on the right move out of view to the side. Consequently, the tunnel entrance and the person on the road, previously in the mid-background, become progressively larger and closer to the viewer's front, along with the approaching power line structures and surrounding landscape.
