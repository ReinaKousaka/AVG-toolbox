A wet, brick-patterned sidewalk with a yellow tactile strip on its left edge extends from the foreground into the distance. To the right, a wet asphalt road with double yellow lines recedes, showing distant cars with headlights on. On the left, lush green shrubbery and trees line a raised bed, while a person with an umbrella walks away on the sidewalk. Multiple trees with green leaves stand along the right edge of the sidewalk, their bases surrounded by planters, all under a visible heavy rain.

A white car emerges from the distance on the right side of the road, driving towards the viewer through the rain. This white car then moves past the viewer, proceeding from the mid-right to the left side of the frame on the road. Concurrently, a silver car appears behind it in the mid-distance on the right, also approaching the viewer. As the silver car passes, a dark car becomes visible further back on the right side of the road, following the same trajectory. The person with the umbrella on the left sidewalk consistently moves further into the distance away from the viewer.

The first frame shows a wet brick sidewalk with a yellow tactile strip on its left, paralleled by raised planters on the far left and bowl-shaped planters and trees on the right. A wet road with a light-colored car driving away and more trees lines the right side, all under continuous rain from an overcast sky.
end of description
The light-colored car on the right side of the road moves further away, while a new dark-colored car enters from the far right and also proceeds away from the viewer. Simultaneously, a person holding an umbrella slowly walks away along the middle-left section of the sidewalk. Rain visibly splashes on all surfaces throughout the scene, maintaining heavy precipitation.

The first frame shows a wet, brick-paved sidewalk with a yellow tactile strip on the left, and a wet asphalt road on the right, both receding into the rainy distance. To the left, raised planters with green foliage and distant buildings are visible, while a line of trees and large potted plants separate the sidewalk from the road on the right. A solitary person holding an umbrella walks away from the viewer along the distant sidewalk, as heavy rain falls across the entire scene.
end of description
The person with the umbrella continues to walk further away from the viewer down the sidewalk. The rain intensifies slightly, causing more visible splashes and reflections on the wet surfaces of the sidewalk and road, emphasizing the ongoing downpour.
