The first frame displays a multi-lane asphalt highway stretching into the distance, flanked by steep, lush green mountains under an overcast sky. White road markings, including a prominent straight arrow and two turn arrows, are visible in the foreground. To the immediate left, a concrete barrier topped with green guardrails runs alongside the road, while a green highway sign is visible far ahead, centered between the mountains.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the highway, causing the white road markings to approach and then move out of view beneath the viewer. The concrete barrier and guardrails on the left also continuously move closer and pass by to the viewer's left, while the distant green highway sign steadily draws nearer.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a multi-lane highway extending directly forward from the viewer, with a large white arrow painted on the asphalt in the immediate foreground. To the left, a concrete barrier topped with green posts and a metal guardrail runs alongside the road, while a similar guardrail system is on the right. Towering, verdant mountains flank both sides of the highway, receding into the misty distance directly ahead where a green highway sign is visible under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the vehicle moves forward, the white arrow in the foreground quickly recedes and moves out of view. The concrete barrier and green posts on the left, initially in the mid-ground, slide past the viewer to the left. The distant highway sign and the mountainous valley ahead slowly approach, indicating continued forward progress deeper into the scene.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a wet highway curving slightly right, framed by two steep, forested mountain slopes under an overcast sky. In the foreground, white lane markings, including an upward arrow and a right-turn arrow, are visible on the asphalt, with metal guardrails running alongside. Distant green road signs are visible ahead where the mountains converge in a misty background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the highway, causing the foreground lane markings and guardrails to recede and exit the frame. The distant mountains and road signs grow larger, indicating approach, with the hazy conditions ahead remaining consistent throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures a wet asphalt highway winding through steep, lush green mountains under an overcast sky. White lane markings are visible on the road, flanked by double guardrails on the left and a single guardrail on the right, leading towards a green overhead sign, a vertical green sign, and a tunnel entrance straight ahead. A brown grid structure supports the left mountain slope in the midground.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, objects ahead, including the signs and tunnel entrance, visibly enlarge and approach the viewer, and white arrow markings indicating straight and right turns appear on the road. The vertical green sign on the right becomes clearer, first showing "685m" and then "5.2km" for a destination ahead, while a small white vehicle is newly revealed moving alongside the left guardrail.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a wet, dark asphalt road extending from the bottom center towards a distant tunnel entrance. Lush green, mist-shrouded mountains flank both sides, with a steep, terraced retaining wall on the left. Silver guardrails line the road, behind which a white street light/camera pole stands on the left, and a large green overhead sign indicating "Tuanjieshan Tunnel" with a length of "6268m" and instructions to "Please turn on headlights" is mounted on the right, accompanied by a circular 80 km/h speed limit sign below it.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the large green overhead sign and the red speed limit sign on the right move towards the upper right of the frame, eventually exiting by frame 6. Simultaneously, the white street light/camera pole on the left approaches and moves towards the viewer's left. The tunnel entrance, initially in the middle distance, appears larger and closer, remaining centered as the vehicle drives towards it.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a wet asphalt highway leading toward a tunnel entrance in the distant center, flanked by lush green mountains under an overcast sky. In the mid-ground, a tall utility pole with sensors stands to the left of the road, beside a striped warning sign, with guardrails lining both sides.
end of description
As the viewer advances, the utility pole and warning sign move from the mid-ground to the foreground and exit the frame to the left, while the tunnel entrance and its overhead illuminated sign grow progressively larger and closer in the distance. The text on the tunnel's overhead sign visibly transitions from yellow characters to green.
