The first frame shows a view from a wooden balcony or walkway. To the viewer's immediate right is a brown wooden railing with an ornate, lotus-bud-shaped finial on the closest post. To the left, a series of reddish-brown wooden pillars and walls define the inner edge of the walkway. Further down the walkway, two people are visible; one in a patterned skirt and dark top is closer to the left wall, and another in a blue shirt and mask is further ahead. Beyond the railing, traditional Chinese-style buildings with dark tiled roofs and red walls are spread out in the midground, with a modern city skyline visible in the distant background under a cloudy sky.

The camera slowly pans right, subtly shifting the perspective of the entire scene. As the viewpoint moves rightward, a decorative lattice window on the left wall is progressively revealed. The railing on the right also moves slightly further into the frame, with its lotus bud finial shifting left. The two individuals on the walkway maintain their relative positions, though the closer person slightly adjusts their stance, turning more towards the railing.
