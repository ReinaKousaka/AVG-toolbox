The first frame shows a busy city street on an overcast day. In the foreground, two men in dark winter jackets stand on a crosswalk slightly right of center, while a line of pedestrians walks left behind them. A long white and blue city bus is centrally positioned in the midground, its front facing the viewer, with other cars behind it on the wet street. To the left, a large clock hangs from a 'Macy's' building, and a tall street lamp with a green traffic light stands next to the crosswalk. The background features numerous tall city buildings, including modern structures and storefronts.
end of description
From the initial viewpoint, the city bus in the midground begins to move forward and left across the frame. Its front, initially facing the viewer, gradually turns to show its side as it passes the street lamp and exits the frame to the left, revealing more of the street and buildings previously obscured behind it. Simultaneously, the group of pedestrians on the left continues walking across the crosswalk and off-frame left. The two main men in the foreground mostly maintain their positions, while vehicles in the far right midground, like the white SUV and black sedan, also move forward and left, leaving the frame.

The first frame shows a bustling city street on a cold day. On the left, a large building with "Macy's" banners and a prominent clock is visible, with a black traffic light pole featuring an orange pedestrian countdown and a red vehicle light in the extreme foreground. Multiple pedestrians are crossing the street on a crosswalk in the lower-left to mid-center, moving generally from left to right. In the mid-ground, a tall lamppost with amber lights stands centrally, with another traffic light showing a green vehicle signal below it. To the right, several cars are present on the street, and a multi-story building with large glass windows and red banners ("SUPPORT THE ARTS") is visible across the road. A white bus is partially visible on the far right of the frame.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the pedestrian countdown signal on the left traffic light decreases from '8' to '0' before turning off. Concurrently, the vehicle traffic light in the mid-ground changes from red to an amber warning signal. Pedestrians continue to cross the street from left to right across the foreground. The white bus on the far right gradually moves out of the frame towards the right, revealing a grey SUV positioned behind it, which then remains stationary. The other cars on the street also show subtle forward movement away from the viewer.

In the first frame, the viewer observes a snow-dusted city street scene. To the immediate left, a large building, identified by "Macy's" banners, extends into the background, with a pedestrian traffic light (red) and a "STATE STREET" sign in the foreground. Numerous pedestrians occupy the snowy sidewalk in the foreground and mid-ground, moving in various directions. To the right, a snow-covered street holds several cars, some stationary and some in motion, with a street lamp pole (green traffic light) and a bus stop shelter centrally located in the mid-ground. Beyond the street on the right, another building with large windows and illuminated advertisements lines the street, while numerous tall buildings dominate the distant background under a bright, cloudy sky.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, pedestrians on the snowy sidewalk continuously move, with new individuals entering from the left foreground and others proceeding further into the background. The pedestrian traffic light in the left foreground transitions from red to an orange flashing hand, and then to a white walking figure, indicating a change in crossing signal. Simultaneously, cars on the right-hand street progress forward, with a silver SUV and a black sedan moving deeper into the scene from the mid-ground.

The first frame depicts a snowy city street with numerous pedestrians on the sidewalk in the foreground and left, towering buildings lining both sides, including Macy's banners on the left, and cars on the road to the right. A prominent street light pole with a green traffic signal stands in the mid-ground, slightly right of center, next to a bus stop shelter.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, pedestrians on the left sidewalk steadily advance forward, with some moving closer to the viewer and others exiting the frame to the left while new figures enter from the background. Simultaneously, vehicles on the snowy street to the right slowly progress further into the distance, maintaining their motion away from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a snowy city street scene from a sidewalk perspective, looking forward down the road. On the left, a large building with multiple "Macy's" banners stretches along the sidewalk, where several pedestrians walk away from the viewer. To the right, two individuals stand facing the street near a traffic light pole (showing a green signal) and a bus stop shelter, with cars visible on the snow-dusted street beyond them, and more buildings lining the distant right side.
end of description
In subsequent frames, pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue moving further away from the viewer, revealing more of the Macy's storefront. Concurrently, cars on the street slowly progress forward, also moving away from the initial viewpoint. The two individuals standing stationary on the right subtly shift their stances but remain in their original positions relative to the street.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A snowy city street scene features the back of a person in a dark coat in the immediate right foreground, partially obscuring a bus stop with an advertisement; to the left, pedestrians walk on a sidewalk alongside a building with "Macy's" banners, while cars and more buildings line the distant street.
end of description
The dark-coated person in the immediate foreground moves progressively out of view to the viewer's right. Subsequently, a new individual in a light coat and hat appears from the far right, entering the foreground area. This new person then walks left across the scene, passing in front of the bus stop from the first-frame viewpoint, before exiting the frame to the viewer's far left. Meanwhile, other pedestrians on the far left sidewalk continue moving away, and vehicles on the street subtly change positions.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a snowy urban street scene, featuring a bus stop shelter with an advertisement in the right foreground and a large Macy's building on the left, where several pedestrians walk away from the viewer on the slushy sidewalk. Bare trees, a street lamp, and cars on the road receding into the distance are visible, flanked by tall city buildings under a bright, overcast sky.
end of description
Subsequent frames show the viewpoint subtly pulling back and slightly widening, revealing a broader expanse of the street and adjacent buildings. The pedestrians continue walking away along the sidewalk to the left, and vehicles move further down the street to the right, all maintaining their spatial positions relative to the initially established viewpoint.
