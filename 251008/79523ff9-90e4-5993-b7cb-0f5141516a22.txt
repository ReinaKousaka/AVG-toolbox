The first frame displays a night street scene where two men walk away from the viewer on a sidewalk. To the left, a brightly lit store with large glass windows reveals rows of white gashapon vending machines inside, with a yellow sign partially visible at the bottom left. To the right, other pedestrians walk along a street with moving cars and multi-story buildings illuminated by city lights and advertisements, extending into the background.

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward, following the two men walking away from the viewer. On the right sidewalk, several pedestrians, including a woman in a dark jacket holding an umbrella and a woman in a brown top with a white bag, move towards the viewer from the first-frame's midground, steadily approaching and then passing the initial camera position. The cars on the street and the distant buildings maintain their positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint while the foreground shifts.

The first frame depicts an urban street scene at night. In the immediate foreground, two men walk away from the viewer: one in a dark blue jacket and shorts is slightly right of center, carrying a bag, and another in a black t-shirt is to the left, looking down at a white object. Along the sidewalk to the viewer's left are multiple illuminated gashapon machines, followed by storefronts with glass windows. To the viewer's right, a street with cars, including a black minivan, runs parallel to the sidewalk, marked by a crosswalk. A woman in a camouflage shirt walks towards the viewer on the right side of the sidewalk, behind the two men. Tall, illuminated buildings line both sides of the street, extending into the background.

As the viewpoint progresses, the camera moves forward along the sidewalk. The two men in the foreground continue walking away from the viewer. The woman initially in the midground, walking towards the viewer, passes to the right of the two men and exits the frame to the viewer's right. The gashapon machines to the viewer's left gradually move out of view as the sidewalk continues, revealing more of the building facade. The street, vehicles, and buildings further down the road progressively approach the viewer's position.
