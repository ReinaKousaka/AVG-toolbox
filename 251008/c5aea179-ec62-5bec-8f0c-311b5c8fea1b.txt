First frame displays a man with a black umbrella walking away on the left foreground, while a woman approaches in the mid-left holding a blue bag. Further back, three men walk away from the viewer, with a street and buildings visible in the distant background. To the right, a reflective storefront, featuring a barbershop pole and an overhead 'VIETNAMESE' sign, lines the sidewalk.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the umbrella man moves out of view to the left. The woman with the blue bag moves closer to the viewer and further left, while the three men move further away from the first-frame viewpoint, joined by an elderly person with a walker who appears from the left and continues moving away. The overhead sign to the left of the walking group dynamically changes to display "BÁNH MÌ" then "I PHỞ".
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
In the first frame, a dark building facade with a large, reflective window occupies the right foreground, with a bright yellow "BÁNH MÌ Ẫ PHỞ" sign hanging slightly above it. To the left, a sidewalk extends into the midground, where three men are walking away from the viewer; the leftmost man uses a blue and black walker. Further left, a multi-lane road with cars driving and parked stretches into the distance, bordered by buildings with blue awnings and taller residential buildings in the background. The sky above is overcast, and bare trees are visible along the street.
end of description
The three men on the sidewalk, including the one with the walker, steadily proceed away from the viewer and further down the street to the left. As the viewer subtly advances, the reflective window on the right reveals a broader reflection of the street and cars, along with the interior shop environment which appears to the right inside the window. The "BÁNH MÌ Ẫ PHỞ" sign, initially to the upper right of the viewer, gradually moves further to the left and recedes into the midground. The dark building facade on the viewer's right progressively obscures more of the reflective window as the viewer moves past it, revealing more of the solid wall.

The first frame shows the viewer on a sidewalk, with part of a person visible on the far left and a wooden pole with stickers on the far right. Directly ahead, two men walk away, while to their left is a street with moving cars and buildings, including a "Royal Bank" sign. To their right, a white van and other parked cars are visible next to a building with a blue "BMO" sign, all set against an urban background with a tall building and bare trees under an overcast sky. end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward, causing the right-side pole to recede and revealing more parked cars, including a white sedan, to the right of the white van. Simultaneously, the two men on the sidewalk continue walking further away from the initial viewpoint, and the person on the far left of the first frame exits the view.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts an urban street scene with a sidewalk occupying the foreground, where two individuals walk away from the viewer on the right side. To the left of the sidewalk, a street carries multiple cars moving away, while parked vehicles and a blue building displaying "BMO" line the right side further down. Various other buildings, including one with a "Royal Bank" sign and tall residential towers, are visible in the background under an overcast sky. end of description
In subsequent frames, the two individuals on the sidewalk continue walking further away from the viewer, receding into the midground. Simultaneously, vehicles on the street also progress forward, moving further away from the viewer's static position.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, two individuals in hoodies walk away from the viewer on a sidewalk to the right, alongside a parked white van and a blue-faced BMO bank; to the left, a street filled with moving cars extends past a bare tree, with various buildings including a tall structure visible in the background. end of description. The two individuals continue walking rightward, progressively exiting the frame and revealing more of the white van's multi-shelf rack (still to the right of the initial viewpoint), while cars on the street to the left proceed forward relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a street scene from a sidewalk perspective. To the immediate right, a white utility van with a large metal rack is parked in front of a blue BMO bank building. To the left, a street with several cars, including a dark SUV and a black sedan, extends into the distance, with a "Royal Bank" building and a tall apartment building visible further along the left side. On the sidewalk in the mid-ground, a bare-branched tree stands to the left of two pedestrians walking towards the viewer, under an overcast sky.
end of description
The two pedestrians on the sidewalk move progressively closer to the viewer. The pedestrian on the right is then revealed to be on a skateboard. Concurrently, a new green car appears further down the street, positioned behind the black sedan, indicating traffic movement away from the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a street view with a bare-branched tree on the left, a white van partially visible on the far right, and a prominent blue BMO bank building occupying the right side. On the sidewalk, a woman in a dark coat walks away from the viewer on the left, while a man on rollerblades moves ahead of her on the right; a street with moving cars and distant buildings, including a Royal Bank, extends on the left.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, both the woman and the rollerblading man continuously advance further away from the viewer along the sidewalk. The man on rollerblades slightly outpaces the woman, gradually increasing the distance between them as they recede into the scene, while cars on the adjacent street also continue moving away from the viewer.
