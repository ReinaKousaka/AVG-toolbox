The first frame displays a street scene from a pedestrian's perspective on a sidewalk. To the left, a grocery store features a long awning, windows stocked with fruits and vegetables, shopping carts, red crates, and a chalkboard sign, with several people near its entrance. In the mid-ground, three pedestrians—a woman in a black dress, a child in a grey hoodie, and a woman in a light top—walk away from the viewer along the sidewalk, with other pedestrians further ahead. To the right, a street is lined with parked cars, including a silver minivan closest to the viewer and a black sedan behind it, alongside a street pole with a blue and red bus stop sign. Buildings and trees are visible in the background.

As the viewpoint progresses forward along the sidewalk, the three main pedestrians in the foreground continue walking away, gradually receding further into the mid-ground of the original viewpoint. On the left, a man in a black shirt becomes more visible as he moves past the initial foreground space, pushing a shopping cart near the store entrance. Simultaneously, on the right, the silver minivan recedes from view as the camera moves past its initial position, revealing more of the black sedan parked behind it and a brown street sign. Further down the store frontage on the left, a large wooden fruit stand laden with produce becomes more prominent, and more distant pedestrians and vehicles emerge into view on the street ahead.

A black car is parked to the viewer's right, while a busy city street with moving traffic and distant pedestrians stretches into the background.

As the frames progress, the three foreground figures advance, revealing more of the grocery store's fruit displays to the left and introducing a man in a black shirt who appears near the bins. Vehicles and pedestrians in the mid-distance continue their movement along the street, maintaining their spatial positions relative to the initial viewpoint.

The first frame captures a street scene with the viewer slightly behind and to the right of three people walking on a sidewalk. To the viewer's left, a fruit stand under an awning displays produce like watermelons and oranges, with a store entrance visible further back. Straight ahead on the sidewalk, several pedestrians including two individuals and another pushing a cart are visible, while a busy street with cars and a crosswalk stretches to the viewer's right, leading into the background.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the two pedestrians and the person pushing a cart, initially straight ahead on the sidewalk, steadily advance towards the viewer's immediate position. Simultaneously, vehicles on the street to the right of the viewer and a pedestrian on the crosswalk continue their respective movements across the mid-ground.
