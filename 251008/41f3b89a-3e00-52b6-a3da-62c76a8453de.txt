To the right, a red train carriage with black railings is partially visible, curving along tracks that recede into the distance. A lush green grassy field occupies the lower left and center, bordered by bushes near the tracks. In the midground, a cluster of tall, leafy trees stands prominently, with a small brown wooden building nestled behind them towards the right. Towering green mountains, some with visible rock faces or mist, dominate the background from the left to the right, under a clear blue sky.

As the train progresses, the entire landscape, including the field, bushes, trees, and the small building, continuously scrolls from right to left relative to the viewer's moving perspective. The red train carriage remains to the right as the scenery recedes into the distance and moves out of frame to the left, revealing new sections of the verdant mountain landscape from the right.

The viewer is positioned on a train, with its red side partially visible along the right edge of the frame. In the foreground, a bright green grassy field stretches across the left and center, meeting dense green bushes that extend towards the mid-right, adjacent to the train tracks. Two prominent trees stand in the center-left midground, with a small brown wooden building nestled amongst more trees behind the bushes in the center-right midground, all set against a backdrop of vast, tree-covered mountains under a clear blue sky.

As the train moves forward, the immediate foreground elements like the grass and bushes recede to the right. The entire landscape shifts left relative to the initial viewpoint, revealing more of the distant valley and mountainous terrain to the left of the previously visible building.
