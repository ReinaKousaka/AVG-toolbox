The first frame captures a rain-soaked, uphill street at night. In the foreground, a wet asphalt road features yellow double lines on the left and white crosswalk stripes on the right. To the mid-ground left, a building with illuminated windows and a large red banner displaying Korean text stands beside the road, with two white scooters parked nearby. On the right, a green-painted path runs parallel to the street, bordered by a dark fence and trees. Numerous streetlights cast reflections on the wet surface, leading up to a distant vehicle with red taillights in the background.

In the following frames, the scene remains consistent, with no new objects or locations revealed relative to the first-frame viewpoint. However, the intensity of the rainfall appears to fluctuate, causing more visible ripples and streaks of water on the wet road surface and in the puddles. The reflections of the streetlights also subtly shift with the changing water flow.

The first frame displays a wet, dimly lit street at night, viewed from a low angle looking forward and slightly downhill. To the viewer's immediate left, a large red banner with Korean text hangs from a building, below which are two yellow sandwich board signs and two scooters parked on the curb. To the right, a green bicycle lane runs alongside a fence and some foliage, with distant vehicle taillights visible further down the road.

Subsequent frames show a progressive increase in water flow and accumulation on the street, particularly in the lower-center and right portions of the road, where puddles gradually form and expand. The visible streaks of rain also become more pronounced, indicating an intensification of the downpour.

In the first frame, a wet, reflective asphalt street stretches from the foreground into the background, flanked by buildings under night lighting. On the immediate left, a building displays a red banner and a dark signboard with Korean text, in front of which stand two yellow A-frame signs and a yellow pole with a red no-smoking symbol. A white scooter and a darker scooter are parked along the left sidewalk behind the pole, with stairs ascending further back. The road features yellow lines and a prominent red-painted central lane with a white '20' speed limit marking, while a manhole cover is visible on the bottom right. To the right, a green-painted lane borders the street, followed by building walls, some foliage, a yellow and black barrier further back, and trees in the upper right corner. In the distant background, the street is lit by numerous streetlights, and the taillights of a vehicle are visible. Heavy rain is visibly falling.
end of description
The scene undergoes a slow, continuous forward camera movement. This movement causes stationary objects like the yellow no-smoking sign, the parked white scooter on the left, and the '20' speed limit marking on the road to gradually enlarge and appear closer to the viewer. Throughout the sequence, the heavy rainfall persists, creating visible streaks of light from the overhead street lamps illuminating the wet asphalt as the viewpoint advances.
