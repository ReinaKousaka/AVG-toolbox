The first frame shows a wet city street at night during heavy rain. In the foreground, a dark pole stands prominently on the left, with a purple electric scooter parked at its base. A crosswalk with white stripes spans the wet road directly in front of the viewer, reflecting city lights. A dark car with headlights on is in the middle ground, approaching the crosswalk from the right, while a white SUV and another dark car are parked on the left side of the street. To the viewer's immediate right is a brightly lit building with large glass windows. Buildings and storefronts with various signs and traffic lights are visible in the background and across the street.
end of description
A white car emerges from the left of the frame in the third image, driving across the wet crosswalk towards the right side of the street. This white car continues moving away to the right, gradually exiting the frame by the sixth image. In the ninth frame, a green umbrella is newly introduced in the upper left foreground, partially obscuring the view, suggesting a person holding it has moved into the viewpoint's immediate proximity.
