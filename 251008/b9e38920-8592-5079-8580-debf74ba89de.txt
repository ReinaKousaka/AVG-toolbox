The first frame displays a picturesque outdoor setting with rough stone steps leading uphill in the foreground and midground. A large tree trunk occupies the far left, while the steps are flanked by rocks and abundant green foliage, particularly dense on the right slope. Several people are visible ascending the steps, including a woman in a grey cardigan and blue skirt standing on the left side of the steps, and a man in a blue shirt walking up centrally. Higher up, behind these individuals, a stone balustrade and wall with three dark umbrellas suggest an elevated area, accompanied by a black lamppost to the right of the steps. The background reveals more lush green trees and a hazy sky, with distant figures scattered on rocky terrain to the right.

In the following frames, the woman on the left turns her head slightly to her left, looking away from the camera's initial viewpoint. The man in the blue shirt and other individuals behind him continue their ascent up the stone steps, moving further away from the viewer. Similarly, figures positioned on the rocky terrain to the right of the path exhibit minor shifts in their postures and positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The collective movement depicts people steadily progressing upwards along the path.

In the first frame, two women are visible in the foreground on the left, with one in a grey hoodie closer to the viewer and another largely obscured by her. To their right and further back, a group of people ascends stone steps, led by a man in a blue plaid shirt facing away from the viewer. To the right of the steps, a rocky, vegetated slope rises upwards, with several people visible climbing or walking on it. A black lamppost stands prominently in the mid-ground, slightly to the right of the center. In the background, a stone wall or bridge structure with ornate carvings spans the upper left, topped by three dark umbrellas and a railing, with dense green foliage and trees filling the upper right.

As the sequence progresses, the two women on the far left gradually move out of the frame to the left. This movement increasingly reveals a large circular stone carving on the wall in the mid-left, which was previously partially obscured. Concurrently, the group of people on the stairs continues to ascend further away from the viewer and towards the center-left. The individuals on the rocky bank on the right also continue their upward movement, deeper into the scene towards the upper right.
