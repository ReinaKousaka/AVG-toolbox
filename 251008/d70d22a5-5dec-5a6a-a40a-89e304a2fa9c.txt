The first frame depicts a narrow paved road ascending into a mountain village under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's left, a steep, partially snow-covered slope of dry grass rises, featuring a large bare tree trunk and branches in the upper left and dense pine trees beyond. On the right side of the road, a dark car is parked next to a wooden building, with several other structures, including a prominent white multi-story building, visible further up the road. end of description.
As the viewpoint gradually moves forward, two individuals, one in a blue jacket, and a small white dog on a leash emerge from behind the parked car on the right side of the road. They then steadily walk towards the viewer, progressing along the right side of the road past the stationary vehicle.
