In the first frame, a narrow paved street extends from the foreground to the background. To the immediate right, a vibrant food stall with a red and yellow striped awning features a large poster of red fruit and an orange cart with a white stool. Further down on the right is a multi-story building with a shop displaying "029" signs, numerous outdoor lights, and an artificial green turf area adorned with a large person-shaped cutout, small white tables, and stools under a clear canopy. Several pedestrians are walking away from the viewer along the street on the left, which is lined with buildings, utility poles, and wires against a clear blue sky.

The viewpoint progresses forward along the street. The red and yellow striped food stall on the immediate right moves out of the frame. The shop marked '029' on the mid-right becomes closer and more detailed, revealing more signs, benches, and a Coca-Cola poster on its exterior. Concurrently, people walking ahead on the left side of the street recede into the distance and eventually exit the frame.

The first frame depicts a narrow street under a clear blue sky, flanked by buildings housing shops and restaurants. On the immediate right, a restaurant with a red-bricked facade, "029" signage, red benches, and a large menu board stands, with a partially obscured cardboard cutout and pink curtain to its far right. A person in dark clothing and white pants is visible walking away from the viewer down the street on the left, next to a building with green foliage.

As the frames progress, this person continues to move further into the distance along the street, appearing smaller relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
