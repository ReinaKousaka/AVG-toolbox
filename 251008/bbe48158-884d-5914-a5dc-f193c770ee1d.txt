A paved road extends forward from the viewer, bordered by stone walls to the left and right, with a sidewalk to the right. On the right sidewalk, a tall pole displays multiple blue, green, and brown directional signs pointing left and right, with a smaller blue sign featuring a cross symbol below them, and a red fire hydrant near the wall. In the distance, a silver SUV and a white car drive away on the road, while buildings with red roofs and trees are visible in the background under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint steadily moves forward along the road, the cluster of directional signs on the right gradually exits the frame to the right, while the silver SUV ahead draws closer. Concurrently, a blue sign with a cross on the pole, initially somewhat obscured on the right, becomes fully visible, revealing text, and a new "L'ORBE" sign emerges on the right wall, having been situated further ahead along the path from the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a silver SUV directly to the viewer's immediate left on a paved road featuring a white dashed line. Straight ahead, a white car is visible in the distance, while a large pink building with a prominent red roof, tower, and Swiss flag, alongside other structures and trees, stands on an elevated bank to the left, behind a stone and metal bridge railing. To the right, a similar bridge railing lines the road with more trees and buildings further back, all under a cloudy sky.
end of description
The silver SUV on the immediate left proceeds forward and out of frame, while the distant white car approaches steadily, passing the viewer's position on the left side of the road.

In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a gray asphalt road with white dashed lines, likely on a bridge, flanked by stone railings on both sides. A white car occupies the foreground to the left, partially obscuring the left railing as it moves away from the viewer. Further down the road, on the left, stands a prominent multi-story pink building with red awnings and a red roof, displaying a Swiss flag, with other buildings and green trees receding into the background. To the right, beyond the railing, more red-roofed buildings and trees are visible, while a tall evergreen tree and a street light pole stand in the mid-ground over the road. Overhead, the sky is predominantly covered with dense grey clouds, with patches of blue visible.

end of description
In subsequent frames, the white car continues to move away from the viewer, eventually exiting the left side of the frame. Simultaneously, the viewpoint advances slightly forward and shifts subtly to the right, revealing more of the street light pole which was previously partially obscured, now showing multiple informational signs attached to its upper section. The background buildings and trees to the left and right remain largely in their original spatial positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint, appearing slightly larger as the viewpoint approaches them.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The viewer is positioned on a road, likely a bridge, looking straight ahead towards a town under a cloudy sky. Stone balustrades with decorative posts line both sides of the asphalt road, which features a dashed white center line. To the left, beyond the railing, is a parking area with cars in front of a multi-story, peach-colored building with red shutters and various commercial signs, with a spire visible further left. On the right, a large coniferous tree stands prominently, partially obscuring a house with a red-tiled roof and red shutters, while a tall grey pole adorned with multiple white and blue parking signs is partially visible on the far right.
end of description
The tall grey pole with parking signs, initially on the far right of the first frame, progressively moves further to the right and out of view across the subsequent images. By the fifth frame, the pole is no longer visible to the right of the original viewpoint. This indicates the viewer is moving forward along the road, causing stationary objects on the immediate side to exit the frame from the initial perspective.
