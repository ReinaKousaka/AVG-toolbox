The first frame depicts a sunlit, narrow European alleyway. To the left, a bald man in a blue hoodie and tan pants stands near a shop entrance marked "Bar Molo," partially obscured by another person in a black jacket; a yellow building with green potted plants is visible behind them. To the right, a man in a dark jacket and jeans sits on a stone bench under a white umbrella, eating from a cone, with a yellow cushion visible next to him. Further down the alley, away from the viewer, a couple walks, and the alley recedes between buildings.

Chronologically, the bald man in the blue hoodie proceeds further left, approaching the shop entrance, and the person initially obscuring him moves out of the frame. Simultaneously, the man on the bench continues to eat his ice cream, while the couple in the distant alley walks further away from the first-frame viewpoint. As the bald man moves, more of the yellow building and its features, including another door and additional potted plants, become visible on the left side of the alley.

A young man eating an ice cream cone sits on a bench in the foreground right, partially obscured by a white umbrella and plants above him. To his left and slightly behind him, another man in a blue shirt stands facing left, while a woman with a backpack walks away from the viewer up a narrow, cobbled street in the midground center. On the left, a yellow building features a grey door, a red mailbox-like object, and three potted plants, with a dark doorway framing the extreme foreground left. The street recedes uphill into the background, flanked by buildings, revealing a glimpse of trees and sky.

The person in the blue shirt on the far left quickly moves out of the frame. The young man with the ice cream slowly shifts his position and exits the frame to the right, revealing more of the white umbrella and green foliage that were previously behind him. Concurrently, the man in the blue shirt walks to the right and also moves out of view behind the plants and umbrella. The woman in the pink scarf continues to walk further up the street, receding into the distance.
