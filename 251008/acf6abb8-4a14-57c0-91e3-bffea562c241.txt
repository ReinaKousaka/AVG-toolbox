The first frame presents a rainy city street scene; a wet paved sidewalk on the left features a person in a yellow top and black umbrella walking towards the viewer, flanked by a green vegetated slope. To the right, a dark metal railing separates the sidewalk from a wet multi-lane road where a red bus and several umbrella-wielding pedestrians are visible further down, with distant buildings obscured by the rain.

In subsequent frames, the person in yellow walks closer to the viewer and exits the frame to the left, while another woman in shorts and light boots, holding a light umbrella, enters from the mid-ground left and approaches. Concurrently, the red bus on the right side of the road slowly moves further right and out of view, as other pedestrians continue to navigate the rainy street.

The first frame captures a rainy street scene with a wet sidewalk running from the foreground left towards the mid-ground, bordered by a dense green hedge on a slope. A partially visible person with a black umbrella is in the far left foreground, while further down the sidewalk, several other pedestrians with umbrellas walk towards the viewer. Multiple tree trunks are spaced along the sidewalk, with two prominent ones to the right of the main pedestrian path. To the right of these trees, a metal railing separates the sidewalk from a wet road where a red and white bus and other vehicles are present, along with a red traffic light in the mid-ground right. Blurry buildings rise in the misty background.

The camera slowly pans to the right, revealing more of the wet street to the right of the initial viewpoint while the person on the far left exits the frame. The prominent tree trunks shift left within the new view, while the red and white bus on the mid-ground road moves further right and out of sight. More vehicles appear on the road, traveling to the right of the original viewpoint. Concurrently, the pedestrians on the sidewalk continue walking towards the first-frame viewpoint, passing the now more central tree trunks.

The first frame shows a rainy urban street: a wet sidewalk on the left, flanked by green foliage, features three individuals walking with umbrellas, with the closest person in the left foreground carrying a blue bag. A large tree trunk stands centrally, next to a yellow-striped post and a metal railing that separates the sidewalk from a multi-lane wet road on the right, where cars and a red bus are visible in the distance at a traffic light.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the person initially in the left foreground moves past the viewer and out of frame to the left. The other two individuals on the sidewalk continue walking away from the viewer, with the person originally in the mid-left advancing into the foreground, followed by the person who was furthest. Crucially, a black bicycle becomes newly visible, leaning against the railing to the right of the central tree in the mid-right of the frame.
