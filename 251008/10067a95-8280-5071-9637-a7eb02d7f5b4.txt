A paved street extends from the viewer towards a distant church tower, flanked by buildings, trees, and potted plants on both sides. Cafe tables with red checkered cloths and chairs occupy the right foreground, while a person sits near a blue door on the left; a man in red shorts and a woman in a blue dress walk away from the viewer in the street's center.

The couple continues to walk further into the distance along the street, remaining in the center. A black sandwich board sign becomes newly visible on the right side of the street, positioned behind the initially seen cafe tables and slightly to the right of the now more distant couple. The man and woman then pause and turn slightly towards the right, remaining ahead of the viewer in the middle-distance.

The first frame shows a paved street stretching into the distance, lined with buildings and trees on both sides, culminating in a church bell tower under a bright sky. In the midground, two people stand with their backs to the viewer, positioned centrally on the path but slightly towards the right, flanked by potted plants and shopfronts.
end of description
The two individuals subsequently walk away from the viewer, moving further down the street. As they advance, more of the street's midground features, including outdoor seating and building facades on both the left and right, are progressively revealed relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
