The first frame shows a scenic view from a train, with green grassy fields in the foreground and mid-ground. A dirt path leads left towards hillside houses, while train tracks run parallel to the viewer on the right, past a building with an excavator, and distant snow-capped mountains rise under a clear blue sky.

As the viewer moves forward, a red and white striped barrier briefly appears and rapidly passes from the mid-right. The building and excavator in the mid-ground gradually reveal more of their structure as they recede towards the mid-left, while the distant houses and mountains shift further left in the background.

In the first frame, a partial wooden house occupies the immediate foreground on the left. A vast green grassy slope fills the midground, ascending towards multiple traditional houses nestled on a hillside under a blue, cloudy sky, while a dark mountain range looms in the far background on the right, with train tracks visible along the bottom right edge.

As the scene progresses, the foreground house on the left moves out of frame. Simultaneously, the viewpoint advances forward, revealing more of the hillside to the right, where additional houses, a substantial stone wall, and several dark rectangular solar panels progressively emerge from the right side, becoming more centrally positioned relative to the initial viewpoint.
