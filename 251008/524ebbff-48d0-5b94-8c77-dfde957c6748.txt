The first frame captures a concrete sidewalk extending into the distance, bordered on the right by a large, light-colored building featuring dark windows and a line of silver metal barricades positioned closest to the viewer. To the left of the sidewalk, a street with parked cars, silver bollards, green trees, and a prominent streetlamp with a red sign are visible under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The camera slowly advances forward, causing the initially visible barricades and bollards on either side to recede and exit the frame behind the viewer's new position. This forward movement continuously reveals more of the building's facade and new sections of the street and sidewalk that were further ahead in the initial frame. An additional streetlamp appears further down the street on the far left, and distant pedestrians on the sidewalk ahead slowly approach the viewer as the scene unfolds.

The first frame depicts a sunny street scene with a large, light-colored building on the right, alongside which silver metal barricades are stacked in the immediate foreground. A paved sidewalk extends from the foreground into the distance, bordered on the left by a row of silver bollards, separating it from a street containing parked and some moving cars further down. A black streetlamp with a red sign is positioned to the mid-left, while trees and additional buildings are visible along the street and in the background-left. Several small figures are discernible walking on the sidewalk in the midground.
end of description
Across the subsequent frames, the scene remains largely static. No significant dynamic changes or newly revealed objects occur; the cars, people, and the entire environment appear almost entirely still from the initial viewpoint.

The first frame captures a sunlit city sidewalk looking forward, featuring a large, light-colored building on the right, and a street lined with cars and trees on the left, separated by cylindrical bollards and a lamppost with an American flag. end of description. Throughout the following frames, the scene is mostly static, though a black car on the street to the left subtly inches forward, and distant pedestrians on the sidewalk exhibit minor walking movements, accompanied by negligible shifts in shadows.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a wide concrete sidewalk extends from the foreground directly in front of the viewer, leading into the distance. To the left, a series of silver bollards line the sidewalk, separating it from a multi-lane street where several cars are visible, including a dark car closest to the viewer and a white car behind it, all heading away. Further left, a line of trees with green foliage stands, and in the distance, other buildings and streetlights are visible under a clear blue sky. To the right, a large, light-colored building with multiple windows dominates the frame, with metal barriers positioned closer to the viewer along its base. Several pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk far ahead on the right.

end of description

As the frames progress, the cars on the street to the left of the viewer move forward, driving away into the distance. Similarly, pedestrians on the sidewalk to the right of the viewer continue walking away. No new objects or scenes are revealed from outside the initial frame's view; the changes observed are primarily the ongoing movement of vehicles and people within the established street scene.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
A wide sidewalk extends towards the distant center, bordered on the right by a large, light-colored stone building with many windows, and on the left by a street with several cars. In the immediate foreground, silver bollards and a curved railing are on the left adjacent to the street, while metal barriers are on the far right; pedestrians are visible further ahead on the sidewalk.
end of description
The camera subtly advances forward, revealing more of the pavement directly ahead relative to the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, the black car on the street drives further left and out of the scene, while the pedestrians on the sidewalk progress further into the distance.

In the first frame, a wide concrete sidewalk extends from the viewer's foreground into the midground. To the left of the sidewalk, a row of silver bollards lines a street with several parked and moving cars, and a black lamppost stands prominently in the far left foreground. Along the left side of the sidewalk, several trees with green foliage recede into the distance. On the right, a large, multi-story building with a grey and white facade and tall windows dominates the midground, with a person in dark clothing standing on the sidewalk in front of it. A metal barricade is partially visible in the bottom right corner, and a clear blue sky spans the top of the frame.
end of description
No discernible dynamic changes or newly revealed objects occur in the subsequent frames; the scene remains static with no movement of the person, cars, or any other elements.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a concrete sidewalk leading into the distance with a large, light-colored building on the right, and a road to the left lined by silver bollards and trees. A street light pole is on the far left, and a person in dark clothing stands on the sidewalk by the building on the right.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the person on the sidewalk to the right slowly walks forward, approaching the viewer's position. Simultaneously, the text "JEROME AVENUE" appears in the bottom-left corner of the frame. The surrounding environment, including the building, road, and trees, remains static relative to the initial viewpoint.
