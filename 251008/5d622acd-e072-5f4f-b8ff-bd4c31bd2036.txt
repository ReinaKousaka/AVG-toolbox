In the first frame, a bustling city sidewalk extends from the immediate foreground into the distance under a clear blue sky. To the left, a dark green delivery scooter is parked, partially obscuring a green subway station entrance structure, which has 'Main Street' and '7' visible and pigeons perched atop it. Directly in front of the subway entrance, a grey pole with a blue bus stop sign stands on the sidewalk. Numerous pedestrians populate the mid-ground, walking in various directions; a woman in a green shirt carrying a bag walks towards the viewer, while two men, one in a red shirt and one in a blue shirt, walk away. To the right, a large brick building with glass windows displays a "Macy's" sign, and an awning extends over the sidewalk. On the far right foreground, a person's arm and shoulder are partially visible. In the background, a street with moving vehicles, including a silver car, and more buildings are visible.

The person partially visible on the far right foreground becomes a fully visible woman in a dark t-shirt, walking leftward across the frame before continuing towards the viewer and eventually exiting the frame to the right of the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the man in the red shirt and the man in the blue shirt continue walking further away from the viewer into the mid-ground. The woman in the green shirt, initially in the mid-ground, walks significantly closer towards the viewer, approaching the foreground. On the far left, an older woman with a cane emerges from behind the bus stop pole and walks closer towards the viewer. The general crowd of pedestrians in the background also shifts, with individuals moving deeper into the scene or out of view.

A city sidewalk scene features a woman in a green shirt and an older woman in a blue hat moving towards the viewer on the left. A man in a blue shirt and others walk away towards the right background, past a Macy's store with large windows. A green subway station entrance and parked bicycles are visible on the far left background.
end of description
As frames progress, the woman in green moves closer and then out of the frame to the left, while the older woman with the blue hat becomes more prominent in the left foreground, now holding a cane. Other pedestrians continue to walk along the sidewalk, moving both towards and away from the first-frame viewpoint, revealing more people in the midground.
