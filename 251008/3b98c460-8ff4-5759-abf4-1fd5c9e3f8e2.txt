In the first frame, a city street extends into the distance, lined on both sides by parked cars and multi-story apartment buildings. To the viewer's left, a dark SUV and a grey SUV are parked alongside a light-colored building with balconies. To the right, a row of cars, mostly SUVs, is parked along a sidewalk bordering a light yellow building and a dense green tree partially visible on the far right. Far down the street, slightly right of center, a vehicle with illuminated headlights approaches, while distant mountains rise above the city in the background under a cloudy sky.
end of description
The approaching vehicle with its illuminated headlights steadily moves closer to the viewer along the street in subsequent frames. As it advances, its size increases and its features become more discernible, with the headlights appearing brighter. No new objects are revealed, and the static viewpoint remains unchanged.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame presents a street scene with a dark SUV driving towards the viewer in the midground, its headlights brightly illuminated. To the right, a row of parked cars, including a dark SUV and silver sedan in the foreground, lines a cream-colored building with multiple balconies. On the left, a grey SUV is parked near a building partially covered in white sheeting, with additional buildings and distant mountains visible in the background.
end of description
The dark SUV continuously moves closer to the viewer, growing larger, then passes into the foreground left and exits the frame. All other objects, including the parked cars, buildings, and distant landscape, remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame captures an uphill city street at dusk, with parked cars lining both sides. A white car occupies the immediate right foreground, while a dark car is partially visible on the left. The road ascends between multi-story buildings, including one on the left covered in white construction netting, towards distant mountains.
end of description
As the viewpoint steadily moves forward and uphill, the cars in the immediate foreground exit the frame to the left and right. This forward progression reveals more of the street, the continuous rows of parked vehicles, and previously more distant buildings along the winding road.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a narrow city street ascending uphill, flanked by parked cars on both sides. A building covered in white scaffolding rises on the left, while multi-story residential buildings with balconies line the right, leading up to distant structures under a dusk sky.

end of description
As the viewpoint gradually moves forward, the cars initially closest to the viewer on both sides slowly exit the frame, revealing newly visible vehicles and objects further up the street. On the right, a white car drives out of view, exposing a series of parked motorcycles and a distinct row of orange shared bicycles beyond them. Simultaneously, on the left, a red car comes into clearer view as the viewpoint passes the initial parked vehicles.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows an inclined street with white lane markings and a pedestrian crossing in the foreground. Parked cars and scooters line the left, behind which scaffolding and a stone retaining wall are visible, while rental bicycles, a pedestrian sign, and a light-colored building occupy the right. Further up the street, multiple buildings ascend into the background.
end of description.
As the viewpoint moves forward, the red car on the immediate left, the person on the right, and the pedestrian crossing sign all move out of the frame to their respective sides. The scaffolding on the left gradually recedes and moves out of view, revealing more of the stone wall and a building behind it. Simultaneously, a traffic cone appears on the right curb in front of the blue car, and the parked cars previously in the midground become closer and more central.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows an urban street scene looking down a gentle incline. In the immediate foreground, a grey asphalt road with white markings extends towards the background. To the viewer's right, a prominent blue car is parked, with a red and white traffic cone nearby. Behind it, a line of cars is parked along a pale yellow building with ornate windows that recedes into the midground. To the viewer's left, a row of parked motorcycles and scooters extends from the foreground along a tall stone wall, which is partially covered by scaffolding near the viewer and has arched recesses further back, with some foliage growing on its upper edge. In the distant background, modern high-rise buildings rise above the street, framed by a cloudy sky with a mountain visible on the right.

end of description

The viewpoint steadily moves forward down the street. The blue car initially on the far right shifts out of frame to the right, replaced by new white cars becoming prominent in the foreground on the right side. Concurrently, the parked motorcycles on the left move further to the left and out of view, revealing more of the stone wall and additional parked cars along the left. A pedestrian briefly appears walking on the right sidewalk in the midground before disappearing from view. The street and all buildings ahead progressively appear closer as the viewer advances.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows an asphalt street with white markings, curving gently downwards, flanked by parked cars on both sides. To the viewer's left, a tall stone retaining wall with arched sections, topped by foliage, runs parallel to the street, with a lighter wall featuring recessed arches below it. To the viewer's right, a multi-story, light-colored building with windows and balconies lines the street. In the background, modern high-rise buildings and a distant hillside are visible.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses forward along the street, causing the parked cars on both sides, including the white Smart car on the immediate right, to move closer and then partially out of the frame. A blue parking sign on the right side becomes more distinct as the camera approaches it. Briefly, between frames 3 and 5, flashing blue and red lights appear from behind a parked car further down on the right, indicating a stationary object while the viewer moves past. The street and buildings ahead become more detailed and closer as the camera continues its forward motion.
