The first frame displays a sunny city street with a prominent multi-story building featuring blue windows and green foliage on the midground left, alongside an entrance to an underground parking garage. On the right, a checkered sidewalk is lined with parked cars, including a dark SUV, and several trees, with tall glass buildings and a brick building receding into the background under a bright blue sky. Dappled shadows from the trees are cast across the street and sidewalk, while a black pole is partially visible in the immediate foreground left.

As the viewpoint progresses forward and slightly right, the foreground pole and the building on the left quickly exit the frame, revealing more of the street ahead. The parked cars on the right are gradually passed as the trees lining the sidewalk reveal additional buildings further down the street, accompanied by an increased sun glare in the upper right.

The first frame displays a city street with a patterned brick sidewalk on the right, extending into the distance, bordered by a black fence and lush bushes with a partially visible green sign. To the left of the sidewalk is an asphalt road lined with parked cars, including a dark SUV with a bike rack in the midground, and numerous trees with varying foliage, some bare and some leafy, casting dappled shadows. In the background, modern glass skyscrapers rise on the left, while an older brick building is further down the street under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly advances forward along the sidewalk. This forward movement causes the previously partially obscured green sign on the right to become more fully visible, clearly revealing the text "PRIVATE PROPERTY" as the foreground foliage shifts past the viewer. The dappled shadow patterns on the sidewalk and road also subtly extend forward with the viewer's progression, maintaining their relative position to the viewer's immediate foreground.

The first frame captures a sunlit urban street, with a dark SUV parked on the left street-side, flanked by distant high-rise glass buildings and traffic signals. A paved sidewalk extends from the bottom-center towards the background, bordered on the right by a black fence, green bushes in a planter, and a "NO ACCESS PRIVATE PROPERTY" sign attached to a concrete pillar beside a reflective modern building.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk; the parked SUV and the "NO ACCESS PRIVATE PROPERTY" sign on the right gradually recede and pass behind the initial viewpoint. More of the sidewalk and the modern building's facade become visible directly ahead, as the streetscape continues into the distance.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a sunlit sidewalk stretching forward, bordered on the left by parked cars, including a dark SUV closest to the viewer, and beyond them, tall city buildings. On the right, a black fence runs parallel to the sidewalk, fronting a building with trees and a "NO ACCESS PRIVATE PROPERTY" sign attached to a structure in the mid-right.
end of description.
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly advances forward along the sidewalk. The dark SUV and other parked vehicles on the left gradually recede, while the fence and building on the right become more prominent, revealing the number '555' below the sign and more of the building's facade.
