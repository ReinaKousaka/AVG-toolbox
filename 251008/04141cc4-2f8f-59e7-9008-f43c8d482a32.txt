In the first frame, a thick grey pole with a dark blue sign displaying Korean text "불곡로 33" and the number "33" is prominent on the far left. To the right, a wet asphalt road features white zebra crossing stripes in the foreground, a double yellow line, and a "30" speed limit circle painted further ahead. A delivery scooter with a wooden box is parked on the sidewalk to the mid-right, bordering a street light pole and a building with large windows. On the road, a black SUV is moving away from the viewer and a silver car is partially visible to its left; in the background, buildings, trees, and traffic lights (showing yellow and a blue left-turn arrow) are visible.
end of description
The silver car to the left moves forward and exits the frame, while the black SUV drives further away from the viewer, its brake lights briefly illuminating. Concurrently, the traffic lights in the distance change from yellow and a blue left-turn arrow to red. A white delivery motorcycle, initially behind the SUV, becomes fully visible and proceeds down the road, moving away from the viewer. A person is also seen walking along the sidewalk on the far right, moving further from the first-frame viewpoint.
