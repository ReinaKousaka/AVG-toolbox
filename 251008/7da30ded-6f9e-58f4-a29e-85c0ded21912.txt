Over subsequent frames, the orange hatchback and adjacent cars remain largely static in their positions relative to the viewer. A red double-decker bus, initially on the far left, slowly moves further into the scene, appearing to travel ahead and to the left of the viewer's current position. No other new objects or significant scene changes are revealed.

As frames progress, vehicles ahead gradually advance, most notably the red double-decker bus, positioned to the left of the orange car from the first frame's perspective, which moves significantly forward. This movement reveals more of its side, including 'SBS Transit' branding and its license plate, while the adjacent cars and pedestrians show minor forward shifts.

As frames progress, all cars in view, including the orange and white cars ahead and the viewer's vehicle, slowly advance forward. The red and white bus on the far left moves forward, gradually revealing a traffic light on the left side of the road, which changes from red to green. The dark SUV on the far right also progresses, revealing more of the right-side sidewalk and its storefronts. A silver car begins to appear from the far left as the viewer's car continues to navigate the urban street.
