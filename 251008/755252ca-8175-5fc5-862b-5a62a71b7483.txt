The first frame shows a wet urban sidewalk and road under heavy rain. In the immediate foreground, a dark grey sidewalk with a white border on the left and a yellow tactile paving strip runs towards the mid-distance, where a metal railing separates it from a multi-lane asphalt road on the right. Along the left edge of the sidewalk, a hedge borders a low wall topped with a white fence, and several trees with dark trunks stand between the viewer and the road. On the sidewalk, to the left of the trees, a person in blue shorts holds a black umbrella, facing away from the viewer. On the wet road, in the mid-ground, a red bus and several cars are visible, along with multiple pedestrians carrying umbrellas further down the street to the right. Distant buildings, traffic lights, and streetlights are hazy in the background.

end of description

Heavy rain persistently falls throughout the sequence, creating visible splashes on the wet surfaces. The red bus in the mid-distance slowly moves forward along the road, passing to the right of its initial position. Pedestrians on the far side of the road also gradually walk from left to right, while the person with the black umbrella on the sidewalk remains largely stationary, only shifting their posture slightly.
