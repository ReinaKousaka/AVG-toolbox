In the first frame, the viewer is on a street with yellow lines, facing forward. To the left, a brick building and a utility pole are visible, while to the right, a white brick wall with ivy, a white railing, and a black building with large windows line the road. A black car is parked further ahead on the left, as the street extends into the distance between several more buildings.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera moves forward down the street; consequently, the buildings and the black car on both sides gradually move past the viewer's initial position, revealing new portions of storefronts to the left and the road further ahead in front.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a narrow urban street looking forward, flanked by buildings. To the left is a brick building with a grey storefront and a utility pole, while to the right is a black building with "ANDREW KWO STUDIO" and a white railing. A dark car is parked further down the street on the left, with more buildings receding into the distance under an overcast sky, and yellow lines marking the asphalt road.
end of description
The viewer's perspective steadily moves forward down the street. As the viewpoint advances, the dark car, initially further down the street on the left, appears to move towards and past the original viewpoint. A blue sign on the left building and manhole covers on the left sidewalk gradually become larger and closer to the viewer's original position, revealing more detail as the camera progresses along the street.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The viewer is positioned on an asphalt street marked with yellow lines along its edges. To the left, a red brick building with a large circular window is visible, fronted by a utility pole and a concrete sidewalk with two manhole covers. To the right, a dark storefront labeled "ANDREW KWO STUDIO" runs along another sidewalk. Further ahead, a black car is parked on the left side of the street, facing away, while various buildings line both sides, and overhead power lines crisscross against a light sky.
end of description
Around frame 8, a small orange object, resembling a car, emerges far down the street beyond the parked black car and slightly to the left of the distant street's center. In the final frames, this orange object subtly shifts further to the right within the distant streetscape, indicating slight movement further away from the viewer's original position.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a narrow city street looking ahead, with buildings lining both sides under an overcast sky. In the foreground left, a utility pole stands before a brick building with a storefront; a black car is parked mid-street on this side, beyond which an orange car is visible further down the street.
end of description
As the viewer advances down the street, the utility pole moves out of view to the immediate left, and the brick building and parked black car become relatively closer to the viewer's right as the viewpoint passes them. The orange car in the distance disappears, and a large white truck with a blue stripe emerges further down the street from the initial background, gradually moving closer towards the viewer. The scene continually updates as the viewer proceeds further into the street that was initially in the background, revealing more of the buildings lining both sides.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a narrow urban street extending into the distance, flanked by buildings. On the left, a reddish-brown brick building with large display windows, one circular and one rectangular, is visible, displaying 'LITTLENECK' text. A black sedan is parked on the left side of the street, facing away from the viewer. On the right, a multi-story building with a light facade stands, and yellow lines mark the edges of the asphalt road.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, a subtle leftward camera shift occurs, slightly widening the view of the brick building on the far left. Concurrently, the black car's license plate, initially indistinct, gradually becomes clearly visible on its rear as the car subtly shifts further away from the viewer, maintaining its position on the left side of the street.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a street scene looking forward, featuring a black sedan parked on the left side of a paved road, facing away from the viewer. To the immediate left is a brick building with multiple large, framed windows, some containing round translucent inserts, and a partially visible "LITTLE NECK" sign. On the right, various multi-story buildings with windows and signs like "AON" are visible, along with a distinctive red booth-like structure. The street, marked with double yellow lines, recedes into the background where more buildings and overhead power lines are seen under a light sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the street. The black car, initially parked on the left in the mid-foreground, gradually recedes towards the viewer's relative background, eventually moving past the camera's initial position. Concurrently, new sections of the street and building facades, previously further down the road, are continuously revealed into the viewer's immediate foreground and sides.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a narrow city street lined with multi-story buildings and utility wires overhead. On the left, a brick building with a "LITTLE NECK" sign leads to a grey wall, in front of which a black sedan is parked facing away from the viewer. To the right, another building features an "ALLOY" sign and a red booth.
end of description
The black sedan then slowly reverses down the street, moving further away from the first-frame viewpoint and revealing more of the asphalt and distant buildings on the left that were previously obscured.
