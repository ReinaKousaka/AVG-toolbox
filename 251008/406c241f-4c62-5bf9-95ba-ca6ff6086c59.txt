The first frame displays a city street at twilight, with the viewer standing on a patterned sidewalk next to a crosswalk; several pedestrians are positioned on the sidewalk to the viewer's left and near the crosswalk, while a white car moves from left to right across the street towards illuminated multi-story buildings directly ahead.

Subsequently, the white car exits the scene to the viewer's right as the pedestrians previously on the left sidewalk and crosswalk begin to advance across the street. Concurrently, new pedestrians emerge further down the right sidewalk and cross the street. Other vehicles continuously drive away from the viewer in the far background throughout the sequence, maintaining the initial viewpoint and twilight ambiance.
