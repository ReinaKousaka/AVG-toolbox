The first frame displays a wet city sidewalk with a yellow tactile strip, bordered by green planters to the left and right. A modern glass building with a parking garage entrance dominates the left, while a wet asphalt road and more trees line the right, all leading towards distant high-rise buildings under an overcast sky.

As the viewpoint moves forward, the bollards and planters recede, revealing more storefronts along the glass building on the left. Concurrently, a dark blue vehicle appears on the road ahead, gradually moving closer and then past the changing scene on the right, as road markings become more prominent.

The first frame depicts a wet urban street scene on an overcast day. In the immediate foreground, a grey paved sidewalk with prominent yellow tactile paving strips extends into the midground, bordered by several orange-capped bollards. To the viewer's right is a wet asphalt road with white markings and a yellow line, alongside a low planter containing sparse green foliage. The left side of the frame is dominated by a modern building with glass and metallic panels, featuring storefronts and a bright green illuminated sign. Further into the midground, more bollards line the path, and a longer planter separates the sidewalk from the road. The background is filled with numerous tall city buildings, with a bus visible in the distance down the road.

The viewpoint consistently advances forward along the sidewalk, causing the initial bollards and yellow tactile paving in the foreground to recede and exit the frame at the bottom. The green illuminated sign and the building on the left slowly move towards the left edge of the frame relative to the original position. Continuously, new sections of the sidewalk, road, and additional bollards are revealed further ahead in the foreground, expanding the visible path. The overall effect demonstrates a steady forward progression through the urban environment.

The first frame shows the viewer positioned on a wet, tiled sidewalk in a city, looking forward down a street. To the left, a modern glass-paneled building houses storefronts, including one labeled "FOURB," with a green digital sign near the bottom left. Separating the sidewalk from a planted median with greenery are several orange and black bollards extending forward. To the right is a wet asphalt road with a faint white bicycle symbol, curving slightly right and bordered by a raised landscape with trees. In the distance, numerous tall city buildings are visible under a light sky.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly to the right over the subsequent frames. A person appears walking from left to right on the wet pavement near the left building, moving further away from the viewer. A faint white car briefly appears on the distant road before vanishing. Subsequently, a bright reddish-pink light emerges in the distant upper-right, reflecting on the wet road. Additionally, yellow ground markings near the bollards become more pronounced and defined due to the perspective change.
