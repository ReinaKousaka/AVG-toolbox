In the first frame, a large, dark-wood building with a lighter lower level is visible in the mid-left, set back from a paved road that occupies the center-right foreground. To the right of the building, a tall evergreen tree stands beside the road, which is bordered by a gabion wall on the far right. Rolling green hills rise in the background, topped by a blue sky with scattered white clouds and a bright sun casting rays from the upper-center-left.
end of description
The camera moves forward along the paved road. The large, dark-wood building on the left gradually moves past the initial viewpoint and recedes to the viewer's left, revealing more of its side facade and a mural. Simultaneously, the tall evergreen tree and the wooden fence initially to the right of the building also pass by, moving towards the left side of the initial viewpoint. The gabion wall on the far right similarly moves past the viewer's original position, receding to the left. As the viewpoint progresses, the visible section of the paved road continuously changes, extending further ahead.
