The first frame shows a town square with a paved road curving right in the foreground, featuring a pedestrian in an orange jacket near a central roundabout. A large, ornate building stands prominently on the left, partially under a tree's foliage, while a hedged park borders the right. In the midground, various buildings line the street, with distant snow-capped mountains and flags visible against a blue sky.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the pedestrian in orange walks across the roundabout and exits to the left. Concurrently, a new ornate building on the far right, including a fountain in its park, becomes increasingly visible, while the initial building on the left is also more fully revealed. The entire perspective gradually shifts forward through the square.
