The first frame captures a rainy night street scene with a wet asphalt road reflecting city lights. In the foreground, a dark pole stands on the far left, alongside two purple electric scooters parked on a sidewalk. A small tree is visible slightly to the right of the pole, while to the viewer's immediate right, a brightly lit storefront with large glass windows occupies the corner. In the midground, a black car with headlights on approaches an intersection featuring a white crosswalk, with other parked cars further left. Buildings and street signs, including green traffic lights and a '60' speed limit sign, line both sides of the street under a hazy, rain-filled sky in the background.
end of description
A white car swiftly emerges from the viewer's immediate left, speeding across the wet crosswalk toward the right midground, kicking up water. It then continues moving further right and recedes into the distance. Near the end of the sequence, a green and yellow umbrella briefly appears in the top-left corner, close to the viewer.
