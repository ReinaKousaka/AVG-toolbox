From the viewpoint on a street, a road extends forward, flanked by a sidewalk with a yellow edge and a lamppost on the near left. Behind this, a multistory building with ground-floor shops and an awning stretches along the left side. To the right, a silver sedan is partially visible in the foreground, parked alongside a row of cars extending into the distance, beyond which is a treeline with another lamppost. Directly ahead in the mid-distance, a large grey building marks the street's end, all under an overcast sky.

Following the first frame, the silver sedan on the right moves forward and exits the scene to the right. A dark hatchback, previously somewhat obscured behind the sedan, becomes fully visible to the right of the viewer. Subsequently, a dark grey van enters the frame from the far right, moving forward and passing the hatchback, becoming the closest vehicle on the right side of the street relative to the viewer.

The first frame displays a street scene with buildings lining the left side, where an outdoor cafe with tables, chairs, and seated patrons under an awning is visible in the mid-ground. To the right, a row of parked cars extends along the curb, backed by trees and a street lamp, all leading towards distant buildings at the end of the road under an overcast sky. end of description.
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street; the foreground cars on the right exit the frame, replaced by new ones approaching from the right, while the street lamp also shifts out of view to the right. Concurrently, a person walking away from the viewer on the left sidewalk moves further along, and a white, arched structure or fountain becomes newly visible further down the street on the left, past the cafe.

A street extends forward from the viewer, flanked on the left by a sidewalk with an outdoor cafe under an awning, a multi-story building, and a woman in red pants walking away. To the right, parked cars line the street, partially obscured by trees, with a black car visible at the far right edge; a large grey multi-story building dominates the center midground ahead.
end of description
The black car on the far right moves forward and out of view, progressively revealing a white car, then a dark sedan, both of which also move forward and exit the frame from the right. Concurrently, the woman on the left sidewalk continues walking further away as the viewer moves forward down the street. This progression reveals a wider plaza area to the right, and a series of white decorative arches on a structure to the viewer's left become fully visible.
