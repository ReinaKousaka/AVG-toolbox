The first frame shows an urban alleyway at dusk, flanked by multi-story buildings adorned with numerous illuminated Korean signs. To the immediate left, a vertical banner with a food image and Korean text is visible. Further down the left, a "CRAFT BEER" establishment with large windows, outdoor seating, and neon signs is prominent. Centrally, a person in dark clothing walks away from the viewer down the paved alley. On the right, a building features several storefronts, including a large vertical white sign depicting a person in a blue suit and a "4.8%" graphic. The alley extends into the background, revealing more buildings and distant illuminated signs under a twilight sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the alley. The "CRAFT BEER" establishment on the left and the vertical sign with the person in a blue suit on the right become larger and more detailed as the viewer approaches them, with the latter eventually moving out of frame to the right. New illuminated signs and storefronts are continuously revealed further down the alley on both sides, progressively coming into view from beyond the initial visible horizon. The person walking ahead maintains their relative position, receding further into the scene with the viewer's advance.

The first frame presents a narrow city alley at dusk, flanked by brightly lit restaurants with glass storefronts, numerous advertising banners, and prominent Korean signs on both the left and right. A person in dark clothing walks away from the viewer in the center of the alley, heading into the illuminated distance.
end of description.
As the video progresses, the viewer's perspective moves forward, causing the walking figure to continuously recede further down the alley, away from the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, previously more distant buildings and signs appear to advance towards the initial viewpoint's location, becoming more detailed as the viewer approaches them.

The first frame depicts a narrow, dimly lit alleyway extending into the distance, flanked by buildings featuring various illuminated signs and storefronts under a darkening sky. On the left, a large red and white Korean sign hangs above a brightly lit entrance and a vertical display stand with food images, while two pedestrians walk away from the viewer down the center of the alley. To the right, a building with a 'HOTEL PEANUT' sign displays multiple advertising banners and Korean flags near the top.
end of description
Across subsequent frames, the viewpoint steadily advances forward into the alley. Consequently, the pedestrians move further into the distance, while the storefronts and advertising banners on both sides become closer and progressively reveal more details as the camera passes them, shifting their relative positions from the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a woman in a mask and a light coat walks towards the viewer on the left side of a narrow, neon-lit urban alley, passing a display board of food items. To the right, a prominent "HOTEL PEANUT" sign sits above an open entrance revealing a dimly lit interior, flanked by a large advertisement board showcasing hotel rooms. Further down the alley, a person walks away from the viewer, while various building signs and structures recede into the distance under a dusk sky.
end of description
Subsequently, the woman continues her movement towards the viewer's left, gradually exiting the frame, as the person further down the alley proceeds away from the viewer. Concurrently, the elevator door within the "HOTEL PEANUT" entrance on the right slowly closes, eventually obscuring the interior and revealing additional 'Welcome to Peanut' banners on the adjacent window panels.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, the viewer is positioned in an urban alleyway at dusk, looking forward. To the immediate left, a light-colored scooter is parked against a textured stone wall. On the right, a building entrance with a red frame, displaying "HOTEL" above and vertical banners reading "GRAND OPENING" and "WELCOME TO PEANUT," extends towards the midground. A person with a backpack is seen walking away from the viewer down the center of the alley, while another person crouches low on the right side near the entrance banners. The alley is lined with buildings, signs, and lights, receding into the background under a dusky sky.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the person walking in the midground continues to move further down the alley, receding towards the background relative to the static viewpoint. The individual crouched on the right side also shows subtle shifts in their body posture and position. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the primary dynamic changes are the minor movements of these two figures within the existing alleyway scene.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A narrow, illuminated alleyway at dusk shows a white scooter partially parked against a stone-walled building on the immediate left, and a bright, vertical "HOTEL PEANUT" sign prominently on the right. Further down, a person walks away from the viewer, and another crouches near the right side, with buildings adorned with various signs and lights receding into the distance under a pale sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint slowly moves forward, the scooter (initially foreground-left) and the bright "HOTEL PEANUT" sign (initially foreground-right) gradually recede from view, revealing previously obscured storefronts and details deeper down the alley on both sides. The walking person continues further into the distance within the alley. The final frame introduces a blurred overlay effect, superimposing new, indistinct textual and visual information onto the mid-ground left area of the scene, creating a transitional composite view.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A narrow, dimly lit city alley stretches into the distance, flanked by buildings adorned with numerous glowing signs, predominantly in Korean. A large yellow sign is partially visible on the far left, while a brick building with reflective shutters dominates the right side. A person crouches on the ground near the right wall in the foreground, and another person walks away in the midground, all under a translucent overlay effect.
end of description
The initial translucent overlay progressively diminishes across subsequent frames, revealing clearer details of the alley. The crouching person on the right side of the foreground disappears entirely, while the walking person in the midground continues to move further down the alley. A blue barrel becomes visible against the right brick wall as the viewer's perspective slowly advances forward.
