In the first frame, a viewer is on a rocky, unpaved path that recedes into the distance, curving slightly to the right. To the immediate left of the path, a calm body of water extends towards distant, forested hills in the left background. The right side of the path is bordered by dense forest with numerous tall, slender pine trees and thick undergrowth, where sunlight pierces through from the upper right. An overlay in the top right shows "Pace 6:20/km", "GRADE -1%", "DISTANCE 4.0 KM", and a small map.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the rocky path, revealing new sections of the path and the water's edge ahead. Objects previously in the immediate foreground, like the initial rocks and foliage, recede and move out of view below the viewer. The dense forest on the right passes by the viewer, shifting in perspective as the forward motion continues. The overlay shows the 'Pace' changing to 6:30/km and then to 6:35/km, while the 'GRADE' adjusts from -1% to -0%.
