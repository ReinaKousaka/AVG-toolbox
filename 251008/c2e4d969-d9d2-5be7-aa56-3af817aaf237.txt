The first frame displays a snow-covered forest slope with multiple tall, brown tree trunks rising from the white ground, scattered across the midground and right foreground. Evergreen foliage dusted with snow fills the upper frame and background, with patches of bright sky visible through the canopy above and a distant hazy landscape glimpsed through trees on the mid-right.
end of description
The camera slowly pans right, causing the initial left-side trees and slope to move out of view to the left, behind the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, more of the forest and a wider vista of the distant landscape, previously located to the right of the initial scene, are gradually revealed and shift into the central view from the right. A prominent tree trunk on the far right of the first frame shifts to a central position, while another on the far left moves entirely out of the frame.
