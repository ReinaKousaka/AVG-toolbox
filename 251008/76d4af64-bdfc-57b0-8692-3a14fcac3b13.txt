The first frame shows a wet city street on an overcast day, leading into the distance. In the left foreground, a person walks away from the viewer, holding a white umbrella, just past a green covered stall. Tall buildings with numerous illuminated signs in Korean text line both sides of the street, with a multi-story structure on the right featuring balconies and storefronts. Several small trees are spaced along the center of the pedestrian area, and a large metal structure is visible in the background against the sky.

The person with the white umbrella moves progressively further away from the viewer along the street, past the green stall on the left and then towards the center-left midground. They continue moving into the background, becoming less distinct, and eventually exit the frame entirely.

The first frame shows a wet, paved urban street extending away from the viewer, flanked by buildings under an overcast sky. To the left, a green market stall with clear plastic covers is in the foreground, with numerous commercial signs and taller buildings receding into the distance. On the right, a multi-story building with illuminated storefronts and outdoor seating defines the mid-ground. Several small trees are interspersed along the central walkway, leading towards distant figures and smaller kiosks, while a large metal structure stands tall in the far background.

As the frames progress, the entire scene subtly brightens, enhancing the ambient light and the reflections on the wet pavement. A person with an umbrella, initially in the mid-ground to the left of the center path, slowly moves further down the street away from the viewer, while other distant pedestrians also show slight positional changes.

The first frame shows a wet, brick-paved pedestrian street stretching into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings under an overcast sky. To the left, a green-tented stall stands before various commercial signs, while to the right, storefronts with illuminated interiors and outdoor seating are visible, punctuated by several small trees. A few pedestrians walk further down the street towards the background, where a large metal tower and more buildings with glowing signs are present.

As the frames progress, the visibility of rainfall intensifies throughout the entire scene, with raindrops becoming more distinct and splashing more noticeably on the wet ground. Concurrently, pedestrians continue to move further down the street, and some are seen holding umbrellas more prominently as the rain increases.
