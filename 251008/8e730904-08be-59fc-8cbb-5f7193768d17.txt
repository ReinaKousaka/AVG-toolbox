First, the initial frame depicts a snow-covered urban scene with two women walking towards the viewer on a sidewalk; the woman on the left is closer, pulling a dark suitcase and carrying a purple bag, while the woman on the right carries a dark handbag. To their left, a landscaped area with evergreens and warm lights runs alongside the path, and a snow-dusted street lamp stands centrally between them and distant illuminated skyscrapers. end of description. As the frames progress, both women continue walking past the first-frame viewpoint, moving from the center-foreground towards the left and eventually out of the scene. This movement gradually reveals more of the snow-covered sidewalk and additional concrete benches in the midground, previously obscured by the women, now visible to the left of the original women's path. The background urban landscape, with its illuminated buildings and the central street lamp, remains consistently visible relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The initial frame depicts a snow-covered urban scene at dusk, with a paved path extending away from the viewer, flanked by snow-dusted bushes and concrete benches on the left and a snow-covered ledge on the right. A tall pole is prominent in the immediate right-center foreground, while pedestrians walk further along the path towards illuminated skyscrapers in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the path, revealing more of the snow-covered street and the city environment stretching ahead, further from the initial camera position. Pedestrians continue walking further away, and the falling snow becomes slightly more visible against the dusk sky.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a snow-covered urban pedestrian path extending from the viewer into the distance, flanked by two long concrete benches and snowy bushes to the left, and a wider snow-covered area with a dark recessed section to the right. Several people, including one with an umbrella, walk ahead in the midground, with illuminated building windows visible behind them on the left. Tall, lit office buildings rise against a twilight sky in the far background, directly ahead and to the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the path, causing the initial benches and bushes on the left to recede towards the viewer's left and out of frame. The people in the midground walk further into the distance, and new sections of the snow-covered pathway and surrounding urban landscape further ahead are revealed to the viewer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The initial frame captures a snow-covered urban pathway at dusk, flanked to the left by a modern glass-fronted building with warm internal lights and snow-dusted bushes, while a dark railing borders the path on the right. A person holding an umbrella and another figure walk away from the viewer down the center of the path, which shows some wet patches. In the distance, numerous illuminated tall city buildings rise against the twilight sky.

end of description
Across the subsequent frames, both individuals steadily proceed further down the path, gradually moving away from the first-frame viewpoint. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the primary change is the continuous forward motion of these figures.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a snow-dusted urban walkway at dusk, extending away from the viewer with a paved path in the center. To the left, a modern glass building with illuminated interiors and bare, snow-covered trees lines the path, while to the right, a dark railing separates the walkway from a lower area. Two individuals walk away from the viewer on the central path, with snow-covered bushes and benches bordering the route, and numerous lit high-rise buildings form the city background.

end of description

As the frames progress, the two individuals on the central path continue walking further away from the viewer, gradually receding into the distance. The person initially closer, in a dark coat, remains slightly right of center while moving forward. A dark vehicle briefly appears and moves from right to left in the mid-distance, behind the railings on the right side of the frame, before exiting the scene.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a snow-covered urban pedestrian path leading away from the viewer, flanked by buildings under a twilight sky. To the left, a modern glass building with illuminated windows and snow-dusted trees is visible. To the right, a dark railing borders a snow-covered area, with a large building in the far right background. Two figures holding umbrellas walk away from the viewer on the path, towards a cluster of distant, illuminated city skyscrapers.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the two individuals with umbrellas continue to walk further along the path, moving away from the viewer. Light snowflakes begin to visibly fall across the scene from above, becoming more apparent in the later frames.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a snow-covered urban pedestrian area at dusk, featuring a paved pathway running towards the background. To the left, a modern glass building with illuminated interiors lines the path, while snow-dusted bushes and a light-colored bench are in the foreground. Two individuals, one holding an umbrella, walk away from the viewer on the pathway, flanked by a black metal railing to the right and tall city buildings in the distant background. end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective advances steadily along the pathway, moving forward from the initial viewpoint. The two pedestrians continue to recede into the distance relative to the first frame's position. The snow on the path in the immediate foreground gradually appears more melted and wet as the camera progresses, revealing more of the underlying pavement and the black railing that was previously to the right.
