frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame shows the viewer on a multi-lane road, with a large cable-stayed bridge extending from the upper left across the frame and supported by a prominent tower ahead and to the right. A white car drives ahead on the road, flanked by dense green foliage, fences, and yellow road signs on both sides, all beneath a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the bridge's main structure and associated signs on the left, along with a streetlamp emerging on the right, become progressively closer and larger, indicating the vehicle is passing beneath them. The white car ahead maintains its distance, while the overhead bridge components and side barriers recede toward the rear of the first-frame viewpoint as the journey continues.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a multi-lane asphalt road extending forward, with a prominent elevated bridge structure spanning overhead from the upper left, supported by numerous suspension cables leading to a twin-pylon tower on the upper right, all under a clear blue sky. Green slopes, trees, and guardrails line both sides of the road, with several yellow caution signs and a red circular sign visible on the left, and a chevron sign on the right. Several vehicles are driving ahead on the road.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward on the road, causing the elevated bridge, its suspension cables, and the twin-pylon tower to become significantly closer and larger, transitioning from primarily overhead to more directly in front of the viewer. Simultaneously, the vehicles ahead are approached and passed, while the warning signs on both the left and right sides move from the mid-ground to the foreground before passing out of view behind the viewer. The road markings continuously change directly in front of the viewer as the scene advances beneath the bridge.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The viewer is on a multi-lane asphalt road with white markings, including diagonal stripes on the left and a solid line on the right, flanked by metal guardrails. An elevated bridge stretches across the midground overhead, with supporting cables and two pylons visible towards the upper right. Lush green trees and hillsides line both sides of the road, beneath and beyond the bridge, and several cars are visible ahead, moving away from the viewer.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The overhead bridge structure appears to move closer and expand, eventually dominating the upper half of the frame as the viewer passes beneath it. The vehicles ahead continue moving further into the distance, while the surrounding trees and hillsides recede and move past the viewer's sides. The bridge's shadow on the road also shifts and progresses backward relative to the viewer's advancing position.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows the viewer on a multi-lane road beneath a large concrete overpass that occupies the upper right portion of the frame. To the left, a densely wooded green hillside runs alongside the road, while a concrete wall with some foliage is visible to the far right. Ahead on the road, a white SUV, another white car, and other faint vehicles are seen in the distance, driving away, with prominent white chevron road markings in the foreground.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward beneath the overpass, causing the overhead structure to recede and revealing more of the sky and the road ahead. Vehicles in the distance continue to move away, while a light blue truck enters the frame from the far left, gradually moving alongside the viewer's position. The surrounding landscape, including the hillside and the concrete wall, also recedes as the perspective shifts forward.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a multi-lane highway under a clear blue sky, viewed from a vehicle moving forward. To the left, a teal and silver truck is partially visible, driving alongside a steep, heavily forested hillside. An elevated concrete overpass with its underside visible dominates the upper right, with a concrete wall and guardrail below it, while several vehicles and a distant bridge are seen further ahead on the road.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer's vehicle moves forward on the highway. A dark red car emerges from behind the viewer on the far left, slowly overtaking the teal truck. Simultaneously, a yellow diamond-shaped sign depicting a truck on a slope becomes fully visible on the right, attached to a street light pole in the middle distance.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a multi-lane highway under a clear blue sky, viewed from a vehicle. Immediately ahead and slightly to the left, a red SUV travels in front, with a large light-colored truck paralleling it on the far left lane. Further down the road, several white cars are visible, and the highway is flanked by lush green forested hills on both sides, with a street light pole visible to the left. An overpass crosses the highway in the mid-distance with a green sign beneath it, while a tall white structure and a yellow diamond sign are visible on the far right.
end of description
As the viewer's vehicle moves forward, the red SUV, truck, and other cars in the lanes ahead gradually recede into the distance. The yellow diamond sign and the upper part of the tall white structure on the far right move out of view behind the viewer. Simultaneously, the overpass ahead and the green sign below it become progressively closer and larger as the vehicle approaches them. The street light on the left also moves further back and out of the frame relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a multi-lane highway under a clear blue sky, flanked by tree-covered hills. An overhead pedestrian bridge spans the road ahead, with a light blue truck to the viewer's left and a red SUV with other vehicles in the lanes ahead.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the highway, causing the overhead bridge to recede behind the viewer. Simultaneously, a large white truck emerges from the far right foreground and quickly overtakes the viewer, moving forward out of frame.
