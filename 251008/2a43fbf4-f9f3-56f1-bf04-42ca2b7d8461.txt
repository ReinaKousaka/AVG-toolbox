In the foreground to the left is a black planter filled with colorful flowers. A wet, tiled pathway extends from the foreground into the background, flanked on the left by a green area with a wooden bench and an advertisement banner, and on the right by multiple outdoor exercise machines and a grassy patch with trees. Four individuals, each holding an umbrella, walk away from the viewer along the pathway, with a person holding a black umbrella on the far right, another with an orange and white umbrella in the center, and two more further left with a blue and white umbrella and a yellow umbrella. Buildings and more trees are visible in the distant background.

The four individuals continue walking away from the viewer along the wet pathway. The person on the far right with the black umbrella progresses further down the path, eventually moving out of the frame to the right. The other three individuals also continue receding into the background from the initial viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a wet, tiled outdoor path extending away from the viewer under an overcast sky, with numerous puddles reflecting the surroundings. To the mid-right, a man walks away from the viewer, holding a large reddish-brown umbrella, alongside an outdoor exercise area with equipment and benches. To the mid-left, a covered walkway structure with a curved roof runs parallel to the path, behind which several other pedestrians with various colored umbrellas (yellow, blue, white, black) are walking away. Lush green trees line both sides of the path, with distant buildings faintly visible in the background.

In subsequent frames, the man holding the reddish-brown umbrella in the mid-right steadily walks further along the path, receding away from the viewer. Simultaneously, the group of pedestrians on the mid-left, with their black, yellow, blue, and white umbrellas, also moves forward and further away. Their positions relative to each other subtly shift as they progress along the wet path. The visible streaks of falling rain persist throughout the scene, maintaining the dynamic, rainy atmosphere.

The first frame depicts a wide, wet tiled pathway stretching into the distance under heavy rain, flanked by trees and greenery. On the left, a curved covered structure shelters a group of people with umbrellas, while further down, a person with a white umbrella walks away from the viewer. To the right, park benches and exercise equipment are visible, with a person holding a striped umbrella walking centrally away from the viewer in the mid-ground.
end of description
Progressing through the frames, the central figure with the striped umbrella and the individual with the white umbrella on the left continue walking further away from the viewer. The group under the shelter on the left shifts, and additional pedestrians are seen moving in the distant background.
