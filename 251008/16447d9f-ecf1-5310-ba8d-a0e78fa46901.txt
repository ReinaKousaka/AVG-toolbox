A paved road with a continuous yellow line on the left extends forward, curving slightly left into the distance. Concrete guardrails flank the road, with a shorter one on the left and a longer, weathered one on the right, below which some green growth is visible. Steep, densely forested hills rise on both sides, featuring dark green trees on the left and vibrant bamboo and other trees on the right, all beneath a clear blue sky with two utility lines overhead.

As the viewpoint moves forward, the road and surrounding landscape dynamically approach and recede. A white road sign on the left, initially partly obscured, becomes more distinctly visible, while the green barrier beneath the right guardrail extends further into the foreground. The tall evergreen tree, initially in the midground on the right, also appears to move closer and shift its position relative to the center of the road.
