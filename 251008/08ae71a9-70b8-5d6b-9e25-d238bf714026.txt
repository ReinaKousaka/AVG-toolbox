The first frame depicts a road scene from a forward-facing perspective. In the foreground, an asphalt road extends into the distance with white lane markings. On both sides of the road, rows of lush green trees and manicured bushes line grassy medians. A white car drives in the right lane ahead in the midground, while further ahead on the left, a cyclist and pedestrian are visible. Tall modern buildings rise in the far background under a cloudy sky, and a navigation map overlay is present in the top-left corner.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses forward along the road. The dark asphalt patch, initially in the midground, moves under the viewer and then disappears behind them. The rows of trees and bushes on both sides gradually shift from the midground to the foreground, eventually being left behind the viewer. The white car ahead maintains its position relative to the viewer, while the distant buildings in the background slowly appear larger. The navigation overlay indicates continuous forward movement as the blue pointer advances along the displayed route.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a straight asphalt road extending into the distance, with the viewer positioned on it. Lush green trees line both sides of the road, forming dense canopies, with shorter green bushes beneath them. Ahead, a white sedan is visible in the right lane, while a person on a motorcycle is further ahead and to the left of the sedan. In the background, beyond the trees, several tall buildings rise against an overcast sky. In the top-left corner, a semi-transparent blue and green augmented reality overlay shows a navigation path and a directional icon.
end of description
The viewpoint continuously advances forward along the road. The white sedan and motorcycle ahead move further into the distance, while the roadside trees and distant buildings shift backward relative to the viewer. A black car progressively enters the frame from the bottom right, moving forward alongside the viewer, eventually revealing its full rear side. New road markings, including white arrows indicating turns, appear on the asphalt as the viewpoint moves, and an overhead gantry structure with traffic lights becomes more prominent further down the road. The navigation overlay in the top-left also updates, showing the green path extending as the journey progresses.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a multi-lane road stretches into the distance under a cloudy sky. In the immediate foreground to the lower right, the rear of a black sedan is partially visible. White lane markings, including straight and left-turn arrows, are painted on the asphalt. Lining both sides of the road are numerous green trees, creating a leafy canopy, with a white car and a moped further ahead in the middle ground, nearing a crosswalk. In the background, a cluster of tall buildings and skyscrapers is discernible beyond the trees, surmounted by an overhead gantry with traffic lights. An augmented reality navigation overlay appears in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the road. The black sedan in the foreground shifts slightly right, fully revealing its license plate "E N952H", while the white car and moped ahead also proceed forward, with the moped moving left across the intersection. The overhead traffic signal for the straight lane turns green. A pedestrian with a bag becomes visible on the left sidewalk, further ahead and moving away from the viewer. The buildings and trees lining the road recede backward relative to the viewer's advancing position.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows the viewer on a paved road, looking towards an intersection under an overcast sky. Immediately ahead and slightly to the right is a black car, with a white car further ahead in the left lane, and a three-wheeled motorcycle even further left. White road markings, including a straight arrow and a left-turn arrow, are visible on the asphalt. Green trees line both sides of the road, a pedestrian walks on the far left sidewalk, and an augmented reality overlay with navigation graphics is in the top-left corner. In the mid-distance are a zebra crossing, traffic lights (green), and several tall buildings forming a city skyline, including a modern glass building on the left and a white/grey building on the right.
end of description
The viewer's perspective moves forward and slightly to the left, entering the intersection. The black car, white car, and three-wheeled motorcycle all advance away from the viewer. The pedestrian on the left sidewalk walks further away and eventually exits the frame to the left. As the view progresses, the street's curvature to the left becomes more apparent, revealing more of a reddish-brown building on the far left and yellow-striped road dividers closer to the left. The AR overlay dynamically updates in the top-left corner, adjusting with the changing viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a city street scene under an overcast sky. In the immediate foreground, a black sedan is positioned towards the lower right, with a white sedan further ahead and slightly to its left on the road. The road is bordered by a tree-lined median to the left and a sidewalk with more trees and streetlights to the right. In the background, multiple tall buildings dominate the skyline: a reddish-brown building on the far left, two prominent glass skyscrapers in the center, and a tall dark building with a grid pattern on the far right. An augmented reality overlay, depicting a blue and green map-like graphic with an arrow, is visible in the upper-left corner.
end of description
Throughout the sequence, both the black and white cars move forward from their initial positions. The traffic light on the right side of the intersection transitions from red to green, allowing traffic to proceed. A person on a small, three-wheeled vehicle emerges from the right side of the frame, moving across the intersection and eventually passing the initial position of the black car. The augmented reality overlay in the upper left also exhibits subtle animations.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame features a multi-lane city road with a pedestrian crosswalk directly ahead. A black sedan and white car are positioned centrally further down the road, while a person on a moped with a cart is to the viewer's right, near a green traffic light. Trees line both sides of the road, leading to distant skyscrapers under an overcast sky, with an AR navigation overlay showing a blue river graphic and a right-pointing arrow on the far left.

end of description

Initially, the traffic light on the right changes from green to yellow. The viewer then moves forward, revealing new white arrow markings on the road directly ahead where the crosswalk previously was, as the black sedan and white car proceed further away, centrally. The traffic light subsequently cycles to green, then yellow, while a red sign becomes partially visible to the viewer's left, behind the roadside trees. Concurrently, the AR navigation overlay on the far left shifts to indicate a right turn.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, the viewer looks down a multi-lane road marked with white arrows on the asphalt, with a dark blue car directly ahead and two white cars further in the distance. To the left of the road, a green grassy median with manicured bushes and numerous trees extends alongside a partially visible red sign on the far left, while an overlay showing a blue and white navigation icon is in the upper left corner. To the right, more trees line the road, partially obscuring tall buildings under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the dark blue car and white cars ahead to maintain their relative positions in front of the viewer while the surrounding environment scrolls by. The trees and median on both sides of the road appear to approach the viewer and then recede behind, gradually revealing more of the tall buildings on the right. Concurrently, the green line within the navigation overlay on the upper left corner steadily extends upwards, indicating ongoing progress.
