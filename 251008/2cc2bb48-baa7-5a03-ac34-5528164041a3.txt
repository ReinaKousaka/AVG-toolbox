The viewer is situated on a paved pedestrian street flanked by multi-story buildings. To the viewer's left, a light-colored building with a covered walkway supported by grey pillars displays illuminated shopfronts, metal railings, and dark planters filled with purple flowers. To the right, another building featuring a lighter blue facade and a covered walkway shows various shop displays, with a large grey planter containing purple flowers and a prominent white sign indicating pedestrian and bicycle zones located immediately to the right. In the distance, the street recedes, revealing more buildings, and several people are seen walking away from the viewer along the street's centerline under a clear sky.

As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward along the street. The sign and large planter on the right recede out of view, revealing more of the shopfront behind them. The buildings to the left and right become closer and more detailed, with new sections of their facades and interiors becoming visible. The pedestrians previously in the distance move further away, while new figures become visible ahead, continuing to walk away from the viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a paved street leading into the distance, bordered by multi-story buildings. On the left, a building with an arcade reveals a shop named "Heustock" behind pillars, planters, and a railing. To the right, another building with shopfronts lines the street, while in the middle distance, a distinctive white building with an arched entrance and wooden canopy stands on the left, with pedestrians walking further down the street.
end of description
Across subsequent frames, two men prominently walk from the middle distance towards the viewer, growing larger in the foreground. Other pedestrians further down the street also continue their movement away as the viewpoint subtly advances forward, making previously further objects appear closer.
