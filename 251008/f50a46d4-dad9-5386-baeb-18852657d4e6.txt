The first frame depicts a wet, uphill street or alley, with a white car partially visible on the right foreground. To the left, a light-colored brick wall is covered with green vines and orange flowers, while a white building with brown brick accents and windows lines the right side. Further up the street, a grey SUV is parked, preceded by a row of orange and white "No Parking" signs on the right.

In subsequent frames, the white car on the immediate right moves away from the viewer, fully revealing the row of orange 'No Parking' signs further up the street. Simultaneously, the camera perspective slightly widens, showing more of the brick wall on the left and the building on the right, relative to the initial viewpoint.

A wet asphalt road, leading away from the viewer, occupies the center. To the left, a traditional patterned stone wall covered in green foliage and orange trumpet flowers extends into the mid-ground. On the right, a white building with brown brick accents and traditional dark roof tiles runs parallel to the viewer, featuring several orange "No Parking" signs along its edge. Further down the road, in the mid-ground, a silver SUV is parked facing away, with white and blue traffic cones positioned near it on the right. Dense green trees form the background, with a glimpse of another building further in the distance.

The subsequent frames reveal a subtle leftward panning of the camera. This motion gradually brings more of the intricately patterned traditional wall and a prominent wooden post on the viewer's left into the frame. Concurrently, the parked SUV, traffic cones, and the building on the right side of the road shift further towards the right edge of the frame relative to the initial viewpoint, subtly altering the composition.

A wet, narrow asphalt road stretches uphill between a traditional Korean-style wall adorned with foliage and pink/orange flowers on the left, and a white house with brown bricks on the right. Two orange "no parking" signs stand on the road to the right, followed by three white traffic cones in the center, and a silver SUV parked further up the road, with a dense green wall of ivy and trees in the distance.
end of description
In the following frames, the two orange "no parking" signs on the right and the three white traffic cones in the road's center are dynamically removed, clearing the foreground of the street while the silver SUV remains stationary further ahead.
