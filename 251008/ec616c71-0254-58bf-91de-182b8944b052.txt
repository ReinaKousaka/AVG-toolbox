The first frame depicts a wide urban plaza lined by towering buildings adorned with numerous bright billboards and digital screens, extending into a busy street beyond. In the foreground, three dark planters with small trees are positioned center-right, leading the eye towards distant city lights and traffic, while pedestrians populate both the plaza and street.

Over the subsequent frames, a pedestrian in dark clothing walks from the mid-ground on the left towards and past the viewer. Simultaneously, a white FedEx truck and other vehicles move away into the mid-ground street, and the traffic light on the left transitions from green to red, while billboard content subtly changes.

A bustling city street scene is dominated by three dark grey planters in the foreground-center, receding slightly to the right. To the left, a pedestrian crosswalk features people walking, alongside a white FedEx truck and another white car on the street, all positioned before a backdrop of towering buildings adorned with numerous vibrant digital billboards, including a "W 45" street sign on the far left. The right side shows a building with large reflective windows displaying advertisements.

The white FedEx truck and white car initially visible on the street (to the left of the planters) move away from the viewer and further down the street. Concurrently, various pedestrians continuously cross the street on the crosswalk (to the left of the planters) and walk on the sidewalk. As frames progress, new vehicles, including a yellow taxi, appear further down the street behind the planters and also move away from the viewer. The illuminated advertisements on the numerous surrounding billboards (front and background, left and right) dynamically change their content. Shadows on the ground subtly shift due to slight camera movement, but no new major areas or static objects are revealed.
