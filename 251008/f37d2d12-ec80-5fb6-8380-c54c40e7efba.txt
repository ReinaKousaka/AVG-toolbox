In the foreground on the left, a large yellow spherical sculpture with blue eyes and a smile is partially submerged in a grey, rocky base. The wet, tiled ground extends across the mid-ground towards a modern building with a curved glass facade ahead. A central glass door with "ON AIR" above it and a large blue digital display to its right are visible through the glass. To the far right, a person holding a black umbrella and wearing a mask is partially visible, walking left. Taller buildings rise in the background on both sides of the main glass structure.
end of description
The masked person holding the black umbrella incrementally moves from the far right edge of the initial frame further into the scene and across the mid-ground. They steadily walk towards the left, passing in front of the reflective glass building and its blue display, eventually nearing the large yellow sculpture from the right side of the viewpoint. No new objects or scenes are revealed in the subsequent frames.
