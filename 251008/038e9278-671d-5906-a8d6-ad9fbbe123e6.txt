The first frame depicts a wet, asphalt street with yellow lane markings, illuminated by an overhead light source amidst heavy rainfall. To the viewer's left, a light-colored building stands near a black and yellow striped utility pole, while to the right, a multi-story building features an open garage housing a dark grey SUV and a silver car partially visible further to the right.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the intense rainfall continues to fall across the entire scene. The silver car on the right progressively backs out, moving almost entirely out of view to the right of the frame.
