In the first frame, the viewer faces a narrow street at night, with a light-colored stone building corner occupying the center-right. An ATM is embedded in this wall, and a small potted plant sits on the ground below it. To the immediate left of this corner, a person in a dark shirt and shorts walks away from the viewer, past closed dark metal shutters on a shop. To the right of the ATM, more dark metal shutters line the building, receding into the distance.

The camera smoothly moves forward, advancing down the street. The walking person and the ATM recede from view to the left as the perspective shifts further into the alley. More closed shops appear on both sides of the street, and additional pedestrians emerge in the mid-ground walking away from the viewer. A person is revealed sitting on a ledge to the right, and a Starbucks logo becomes visible on a shop front further down the right side of the street.

The first frame displays a narrow, cobblestone alleyway at night, receding into the distance. On the left, a series of closed shops with dark metal security grates and awnings stretch from the foreground to the mid-ground. On the right, a building featuring a prominent Starbucks logo on its upper right side has a person sitting on the ground near its base in the mid-ground. Further down the alley, two individuals walk away from the viewer, positioned centrally, with another person visible deeper in the darkened background. An overhead streetlamp illuminates the scene from the mid-distance.

The two individuals walking away in the middle of the alley consistently move further into the distance, away from the viewer, as the frames progress. The person initially visible in the far background also recedes further down the alley. The individual seated against the wall on the right side near the Starbucks remains largely stationary. As the scene subtly shifts, the Starbucks logo eventually moves out of the frame towards the right side.
