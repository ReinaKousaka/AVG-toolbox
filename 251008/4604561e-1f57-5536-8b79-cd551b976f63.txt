A person on a bicycle rides away from the viewer on a road with a guardrail to the right, while a bright yellow car approaches on the left lane in the foreground. To the left, a rocky, netted hillside rises, and a silver car is parked further down the road. In the background, green hills and mountains are visible under a blue sky.
end of description
The yellow car moves past the viewer and exits the frame to the left. A white van subsequently appears behind the stationary silver car, further down the road to the left, also parked on the left shoulder, as the cyclist continues riding away from the viewer.
