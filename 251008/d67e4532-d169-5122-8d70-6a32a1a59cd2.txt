In the first frame, a wet, reflective street and sidewalk extend into the distance under a dark sky, illuminated by numerous city lights. A tall utility pole stands prominently in the lower-middle left foreground, featuring yellow and black stripes near its base. To the left, buildings with storefronts and trees line the street, while on the right, a person holding a light-colored umbrella walks away on the sidewalk, past two yellow A-frame signs, with more buildings and storefronts lining that side. Traffic lights in the midground display green, red, and yellow, reflecting brightly on the wet asphalt.

From the third frame, a silver car emerges on the street to the left of the utility pole, moving away from the viewer. It proceeds to drive further into the distance past the utility pole, while the individual with the umbrella continues walking away on the right sidewalk. By the eighth frame, a new person appears on the left sidewalk, walking towards the viewer from the background. This new individual approaches closer to the viewer in the ninth frame, as the person with the umbrella moves almost out of view on the far right.

The first frame shows a wet city street at night, receding into the distance, with a dark pole partially obstructing the left foreground. On the right, a wet sidewalk displays a yellow A-frame sign and a person holding a white umbrella, facing away from the viewer, while buildings with illuminated signs line both sides of the street under a dark sky.

The person with the white umbrella on the right sidewalk gradually moves closer to the viewer, then continues walking further right and exits the frame. Simultaneously, a new person carrying a dark umbrella appears on the left sidewalk and proceeds to walk away from the viewer, further down the street.

The first frame presents a nighttime view of a wet city street, likely after rain. In the immediate foreground to the right, a yellow A-frame sign with Korean text "행운 부동산" stands on the sidewalk. The wet asphalt road, reflecting numerous colorful lights from surrounding establishments, extends into the distance, marked by double yellow lines in the center. On the left sidewalk, two people stand near a storefront, one holding a white umbrella, while another individual walks further away from the viewer. On the right sidewalk, a person with a white umbrella is seen walking towards the viewer; buildings, illuminated by various shop lights, line both sides of the street, with streetlights and distant traffic lights (showing yellow and green signals) visible in the mid-ground.
end of description
The person with the white umbrella on the right sidewalk walks forward past the yellow sign and exits the frame to the right, moving towards the viewer. On the left sidewalk, the person initially walking away from the viewer continues further down the street. The person standing under the white umbrella on the left begins walking towards the viewer, passing another individual who walks towards the left foreground, eventually revealing a dark umbrella appearing from behind them. The distant traffic lights consistently display a green signal.
