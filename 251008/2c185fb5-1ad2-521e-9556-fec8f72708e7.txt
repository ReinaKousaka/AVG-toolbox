The first frame shows a narrow city street receding into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings with various shops; those on the left are mostly shuttered, while the right features open stalls and a "ZACK Bicycle Shop" in the foreground. A person walks away from the viewer on the left side of the street, which has white directional arrows on its patterned paving near the viewer.

end of description

As the viewer moves forward through the subsequent frames, the street's perspective shifts, causing the initial buildings and objects, including the white arrows, to recede from the foreground. The walking person moves further down the street ahead, and new sections of the urban landscape appear, revealing more distant shops and architectural details relative to the initial viewpoint.

The first frame shows the viewer on a paved urban street flanked by multi-story buildings, which recede into the distance under an overcast sky, with numerous blue banners hanging from overhead poles. On the left, a shuttered storefront with a red awning is visible, while on the right, a red vending machine and merchandise displays are seen next to a building; a person in a blue shirt walks away from the viewer in the left mid-ground, and other figures are further down the street.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the person in the blue shirt walks further ahead and eventually out of frame to the left of the viewer. Simultaneously, the red vending machine and merchandise on the right move closer and then out of the bottom right, revealing more of the storefronts and a dark blue bench ahead on that side. The street pavement and the buildings on both sides continually advance into the foreground, bringing previously distant details closer.

The first frame presents a pedestrian street in Japan, lined by multi-story buildings receding into the distance under a light sky. To the viewer's immediate left, a closed storefront with a red awning is visible, while further down, a person in a blue shirt walks away; to the right, "The Beauty Shop" displays items outside, next to a red vending machine closer to the viewer.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves steadily forward down the street. The initial foreground objects, like the red vending machine and the person in blue, recede and eventually move out of frame as new sections of shops and buildings, including a newly visible cat poster on the left, are revealed ahead of the original viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a pedestrian street stretching directly away from the viewer, flanked by multi-story buildings containing shops. On the immediate left, a shop front with a white awning features a large vertical sign displaying a white cat, positioned beside a dark pole near the viewer. To the right, shops with display windows and some items on the sidewalk line the street. A person in a blue shirt walks away from the viewer in the mid-ground, slightly to the left of the street's center, while other pedestrians and bicycles are visible further down the street, which is paved with white lines and diamond shapes.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewpoint advances forward along the street. The person in the blue shirt, initially in the mid-ground, moves further away from the first-frame viewpoint. The shop with the white cat sign on the left and the storefronts on the right become closer and more detailed, eventually passing by the viewer's relative position. The distant buildings, streetlights, and banners gradually approach, revealing new sections of the street that were previously only visible in the background from the initial perspective.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a paved street stretching away from the viewer, flanked by multi-story buildings housing shops and residences. On the left, a light-colored building has a prominent shopfront near the viewer, featuring white decorative elements. On the right, a darker building hosts several shops with parked bicycles in front of them, and a masked pedestrian is visible further down the street. Multiple streetlights with blue banners line the street, leading towards a distant horizon under a light blue sky, with several pedestrians and a scooter rider also visible in the mid-ground, moving away from the viewer.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the person in the blue shirt and shorts, initially closer on the left, moves further away down the street. Simultaneously, the person on the scooter, originally in the mid-ground, advances towards the viewer, becoming more prominent. The masked pedestrian on the right side also progresses further away from the viewer along the sidewalk.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a paved street stretches into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings with storefronts on both sides. To the immediate left, a man in a blue shirt faces away from the viewer, standing near bicycles, traffic cones, and a metal barrier. On the right, a man in a white shirt and mask walks towards the viewer, with parked bicycles and storefronts extending beyond him. Further down the street in the middle, a person on a bicycle approaches the viewer, with more pedestrians, streetlights, and blue banners visible in the receding perspective under a pale sky.

end of description

The person on the bicycle, initially in the middle distance, steadily moves closer towards the viewer. Simultaneously, the man on the right side of the street also walks towards the viewer, passing by the viewer's right periphery by the final frames. Meanwhile, the man on the left remains largely stationary throughout the sequence, observing the area around him.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A paved street extends into the distance, flanked by buildings housing shops. In the immediate foreground, a person in a blue shirt and camouflage shorts walks away from the viewer, slightly left of center, carrying a black bag. To the far left, orange cones, a barrier, and several bicycles are parked alongside the storefronts. Buildings with awnings and banners line both sides of the street, with a shop displaying "BOOKS" on the right, and more pedestrians are visible further down the road.
end of description
The person in the blue shirt continues walking forward, progressively moving further into the midground and to the right of the original center from the first-frame viewpoint. As the scene progresses, the bicycles and orange cones on the left recede towards the left and behind the original viewer's position. Simultaneously, the shop buildings and banners on both sides of the street appear to move past the viewer, shifting towards the periphery and behind the initial viewpoint. New sections of the street and more distant pedestrians gradually emerge into the foreground and midground, moving closer to the viewer's original position.
