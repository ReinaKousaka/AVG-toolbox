The first frame depicts a paved road curving to the right in the foreground, bordered by green grass on the right and a sidewalk with a concrete barrier and wooden fence on the left. On the left midground, traditional wooden buildings stand, with a person in green walking left in the foreground and another on a small scooter near a flag pole; a snow-capped mountain dominates the background under a clear blue sky. end of description.
In subsequent frames, the person in green moves out of frame to the left, while the person on the scooter also proceeds forward and left, eventually exiting the scene from the left midground. A new person in blue appears on the left sidewalk, walking towards the midground and then alongside the road to the left of the viewpoint. Concurrently, the dark car initially in the midground drives closer to the viewer, moving forward and slightly to the left on the road, passing a streetlight on the left side.
