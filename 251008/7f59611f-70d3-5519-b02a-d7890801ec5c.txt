The first frame depicts a stone-paved courtyard with a brick building on the left featuring an arched doorway, a wooden door, windows with open shutters, and potted plants. Four cars are parked from left to right: a silver station wagon in the foreground, followed by a dark hatchback, a light yellow compact car, and a red-brown car partially visible on the far right near a stone staircase, with a stone wall and more buildings in the background. end of description
Subsequently, a new red SUV appears on the far right of the first-frame viewpoint, slowly maneuvering into the parking space next to the red-brown car. The red-brown car subtly shifts forward to accommodate the newly arriving vehicle.
