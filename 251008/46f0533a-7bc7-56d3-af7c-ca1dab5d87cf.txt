In the first frame, two individuals walk towards the viewer on a brightly lit sidewalk: a man in an orange jacket is to the immediate left, and a woman in a dark coat is slightly right and central. To their left, a building with large glass storefronts extends, featuring an overhead awning and decorative potted plants. To the right, a street runs parallel, showing a parked white SUV, part of a maroon van, and distant cars, with sparse trees adorned with small lights along the median. Tall dark buildings with glowing windows rise in the background against the night sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the man and woman on the sidewalk move past the viewer and out of frame to the lower left. Simultaneously, the maroon van on the right side of the street is replaced by a moving blue and white city bus that travels from the right towards the left. A "Sale" sign becomes fully visible on the left storefront as the foreground pedestrians clear the view, revealing more details of the building.

To the viewer's left, a "Sale" sign is in the foreground, followed by a brightly lit storefront displaying "40% OFF" and "CLUB MONACO," with a sidewalk where several pedestrians walk away. To the right, a white SUV is parked, while a black car and a large bus featuring "Vancouver Symphony" move past, set against distant tall buildings and overhead trees adorned with twinkling lights.

end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the pedestrians on the sidewalk, including a person in pink and a white dog, continue moving further away from the viewer. Simultaneously, the black car and the Vancouver Symphony bus on the street steadily progress to the right of the first-frame viewpoint.

In the first frame, a bustling city street at night is visible. To the immediate right, a white SUV is parked, facing away from the viewer. A tree adorned with string lights stands further right, with a streetlight behind it. On the left, a storefront with large glass windows displaying merchandise extends into the midground, with a 'CLUB MONACO' sign overhead. Several pedestrians are on the sidewalk to the left: a woman in a pink jacket with a white dog on a leash is closest to the viewer, followed by a woman in a white outfit and yellow hat, and another in a black jacket, all walking towards the viewer. In the midground, more pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk, and on the street, a bus/trolley is moving from right to left, with other vehicles parked and moving. Tall buildings with illuminated windows define the background.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the pedestrians on the left sidewalk move chronologically past the viewer, with the dog, the woman in pink, and the woman in white and yellow hat exiting the frame to the viewer's immediate left. The bus/trolley on the street continues its movement from right to left, passing behind the lit tree and gradually disappearing from view further to the left. The stationary white SUV remains in its position on the right, while other cars on the street shift slightly, suggesting traffic flow in the midground.

The first frame depicts a night city street from a low perspective on a sidewalk. To the left, a bright building with large glass windows and potted evergreen trees stands, with two men walking away from the viewer on the adjacent sidewalk. A tree trunk covered in string lights is positioned mid-right, partially obscuring a white SUV parked on the street. Further down the street, more parked cars line the right, and a red bus is visible behind them, while other pedestrians walk along the distant sidewalk. Storefronts like 'Sephora' and 'Athleta' are illuminated in the background-right, beneath tall buildings and overhead string lights.
end of description
The two men on the left sidewalk walk further away, eventually moving past the first-frame viewpoint to the left. A person pushing a stroller is progressively revealed, moving from a position further down the street towards the first-frame viewpoint along the sidewalk. The white SUV on the right moves past the first-frame viewpoint, disappearing off the right side of the frame. Simultaneously, a grey Jeep and other parked cars become more visible further down the street, beyond the initial parked cars.

The first frame captures a nighttime street scene, looking down a city block. To the left, a bright building with large display windows and a dark awning lines a sidewalk, where a man pushes a child in a stroller, both moving away from the viewer. Further along the sidewalk, numerous other pedestrians are visible. To the right of the sidewalk, a street features a silver SUV prominently parked in the mid-ground, with a parking meter in the foreground, and other cars parked behind it. A red bus and additional vehicles are moving further down the street, while buildings with illuminated signs like 'SEPHORA' and decorative yellow lights span the street overhead. The background reveals towering, illuminated city buildings against a dark sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the man pushing the stroller and the child progressively move to the left and out of the frame's foreground. Simultaneously, the silver SUV on the street begins driving forward, moving further away from the viewer and revealing more of the vehicles behind it. Pedestrians on the sidewalk and other traffic on the street continue their movement further into the distance relative to the initial viewpoint.
