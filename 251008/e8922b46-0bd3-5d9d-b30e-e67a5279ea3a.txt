The first frame displays a two-lane asphalt road with dashed white lines, extending forward and curving slightly right towards distant green mountains under a cloudy sky. To the left, a grassy hill ascends, featuring a multi-story house and a small tree, while a wooden building and a guardrail flank the right side; ahead on the road, a white SUV is visible, with a dark car further behind it.

end of description
As the camera moves forward from its initial position, the dark car and the white SUV, originally visible ahead on the road, approach the first-frame viewpoint's location, eventually passing it on the left side. Simultaneously, the house on the left hillside moves closer to the original viewpoint and becomes more detailed, while the guardrail and grassy area on the right recede behind the first-frame viewpoint.

The viewer is on a two-lane road, curving right, with white dividing lines. To the immediate left is a steep grassy hill with a utility pole at its crest, and a black Mercedes van approaching in the left lane. To the right, a flatter grassy area precedes a light-colored car receding on the right lane, with trees and traditional houses visible further back against a backdrop of green mountains and a blue, cloudy sky.
end of description
The black Mercedes van passes the viewer, moving to the left and eventually out of the frame. Simultaneously, the viewer progresses forward along the road, causing the light-colored car to recede further into the distance on the right, while the surrounding landscape of hills, houses, and mountains shifts slightly in perspective relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
A paved road with a dashed white center line stretches from the viewer into the distance, framed by lush green hills under a partly cloudy sky. To the immediate left, a steep grassy slope features a wooden house and pole at its crest, while a second traditional house and an approaching white car are visible further along the road to the right.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, white roadside markers on the right edge progressively appear and pass the viewer. Simultaneously, a stone wall on the left side of the road becomes increasingly prominent and approaches, while the white car continues to draw nearer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a paved road stretching forward, bordered on the left by a stone retaining wall leading to a grassy slope with trees, and on the right by a green field containing a distant brown house and a white roadside pole. A white car is visible ahead on the road, with forested mountains and a cloudy sky completing the background.
end of description.
As the viewpoint moves forward, the stone wall and left slope pass, progressively revealing a wooden fence higher on the slope and then another building and parked cars along the left side of the road, relative to the initial viewpoint. The white car, initially ahead, moves closer and then appears further to the left as the viewer passes it. The brown house and distant mountains on the right also appear closer while remaining to the right of the viewer's forward path.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a paved road gently curving left in the foreground, with a rough stone wall and dense green foliage on the left, and a narrow strip of green grass bordering a brown chalet-style house on the right. In the mid-ground, another chalet-style house stands on the left, with parked cars partially visible further along the road, all leading towards distant forested hills under a blue sky with scattered clouds.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the house on the left becomes fully visible to the left of the road, revealing a white lower section with garage bays and multiple parked cars now clearly seen in front of it, displaying an "Auto Schoenbach" sign. Concurrently, the house on the right of the road expands in view, and a stack of white hay bales becomes visible behind it to the right. Further along the road on the right, a street sign pointing left, inscribed 'Kehrichtmuhle', emerges into view. A black and white striped roadside marker pole also appears on the immediate right of the road, closer to the viewer's initial position.
