The first frame shows a traditional Chinese-style covered walkway. To the viewer's left, a red building wall with gridded windows and ornate gold-patterned red doors sits on a grey brick foundation. A grey stone-tiled floor extends forward, bordered on the right by a raised stone platform along which several red pillars support a colorful, decorated overhead structure. In the far background, an archway reveals distant green foliage and a white wall.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly advances forward along the pathway. The first red door on the left gradually opens inward, revealing a dark interior, while new sections of the building and more red pillars slide past to the viewer's left and right, respectively. Concurrently, a stone ramp and steps on the right side of the path become more prominent and closer, eventually revealing a decorative white stone railing further along that side.
