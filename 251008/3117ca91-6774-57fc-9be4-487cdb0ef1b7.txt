The first frame displays a rain-slicked city street at night. Closest to the viewer, at the bottom of the frame, is a dense green hedge. Extending away from the viewer from left to right is a wet asphalt road, reflecting numerous bright lights and featuring white arrow markings on its left side. To the viewer's left, a large, multi-story modern building with illuminated windows and a curved structure dominates, with bare trees along its base. In the mid-right distance, several vehicles with visible headlights and red taillights are stopped at a traffic light, which appears red, while other urban lights and darker buildings recede into the dark background.

Initially, several vehicles with bright headlights and red taillights are stopped at a traffic light in the mid-right distance. The traffic light then transitions from red to green, causing these previously stopped vehicles to proceed forward and exit the scene into the far background. Subsequently, a white SUV enters the frame from the far left foreground, rapidly driving across the wet road from left to right, creating splashes as it moves towards the mid-right background.

A wet urban street scene at night shows a white SUV moving from left to right in the midground, reflecting on the rain-soaked asphalt. To the left, a large modern building with numerous illuminated windows occupies the background, while further right, distant vehicle lights and streetlights are visible under heavy rain. Red and white road markings are present in the foreground.

The white SUV proceeds further right, its brake lights becoming more prominent. A dark blue compact car with a white roof box then enters the frame from the left, moving right in front of the SUV. Subsequently, a white delivery truck with "coupang" branding appears from the far left, traveling right and passing the blue compact car and the white SUV. A dark pole on the right side becomes more visible as the scene slightly widens.
