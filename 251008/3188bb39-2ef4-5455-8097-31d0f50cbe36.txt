The first frame displays a landscape under an overcast sky. In the foreground, several bare-branched trees and shrubs are centrally positioned. Behind them, a broad field of yellowish-brown grass stretches across the midground. The background features dark, tree-covered mountains to the left, their peaks partially obscured by clouds, with a small village visible at their base across the field. To the far right, a large, light-colored building with a reddish roof stands on a slight rise. Teal banners with a logo and "GLOBAL CITIZEN TRAVELS" text frame the top and bottom of the image.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint shifts consistently to the right, causing foreground elements to move rapidly out of the frame to the left. The cluster of bare trees quickly exits the left side, revealing more of the expansive yellowish-brown field that was initially to their right. Consequently, new portions of the distant village and additional buildings at the base of the mountains are progressively unveiled towards the right side of the scene. The large building on the right also moves left relative to the viewer, revealing more landscape to its right as the scene advances.

The first frame presents a wide yellowish-brown field in the midground, with several bare trees positioned in the foreground to the left and slightly right of center. Behind the field, a scattered village featuring light-colored buildings is visible, backed by dark, mist-covered mountains that dominate the background on both the left and right, all under an overcast sky.

As the frames advance, the viewer's perspective moves rightward, causing the foreground trees to shift out of view to the left, while new elements are progressively revealed from the right. The midground field and background village buildings also steadily move left, uncovering more of the mountain range and forested terrain on the right side of the scene. Subsequently, fresh clusters of bare trees emerge into the left foreground, continuously replacing those that have passed.
