In the first frame, a light-colored sofa with various throw pillows is positioned in the lower left foreground. A dark rectangular coffee table, adorned with decorative items including bottles and glasses, occupies the lower right foreground. In the mid-ground, a dark wooden desk with two blue chairs sits centrally, facing a large window with patterned curtains behind it. To the right of the window, a "Mad Men" poster hangs, and further right, a dark credenza with two boxes on top is visible. On the far left wall, a framed black and white picture of men is displayed.

As the frames progress, the view slowly pans to the right. The sofa and coffee table move out of view to the viewer's left, while the desk and window shift towards the left side of the frame. A large, reflective black panel, resembling a TV or art, mounted on the wall above the credenza, becomes fully revealed, along with an additional silver tray holding a glass jar and other items appearing on the far right of the credenza, which was previously unseen.
