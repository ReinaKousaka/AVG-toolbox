The first frame depicts a wet city street at night from the perspective of a person standing on a sidewalk. To the left, a wide street reflects ambient lights, bordered by bare trees and distant buildings, with a prominent building featuring horizontal stripes. To the right, a tall building with reflective glass panels mirrors the vibrant streetlights and city glow, extending into the background, while streetlights and a kiosk are visible ahead on the sidewalk.

Throughout the subsequent frames, rain is visibly falling, causing numerous small splashes on the wet ground directly in front of the viewer and enhancing the shimmering reflections across the street and sidewalk. Notably, between frames 5 and 6, two electric scooters previously standing upright on the sidewalk to the left of the kiosk appear to have fallen or been pushed over, now lying horizontally on the wet pavement.

The first frame depicts a wet, rainy city street at night from a low-angle perspective. In the immediate foreground, a reflective, tiled sidewalk extends from the viewer's position. To the left on this sidewalk, several electric scooters are parked, and across the middle, a wide, wet road reflects numerous streetlights and distant building lights, with a few bare trees adorned with lights separating the sidewalk from the street on the left. Further down the street on the left, multi-story buildings and traffic signs are visible. On the right, a large modern building with reflective glass panels dominates the entire right side of the frame, extending into the mid-distance. In the far background, a tall illuminated skyscraper stands prominently against the dark sky.

The viewpoint subtly advances forward and shifts slightly to the right. The reflective glass facade on the right side of the viewer gradually slides leftward, revealing more of the building and the prominent "STARBUCKS" sign further along its exterior. Simultaneously, the parked electric scooters on the left move progressively out of the frame to the left, bringing new sections of the wet pavement and street closer to the viewer. Briefly, a pedestrian appears on the mid-distance sidewalk to the left, walking away from the viewer, before disappearing behind the trees as the camera continues its slight forward motion.

The first frame displays a rainy city night, featuring parked electric scooters in the left foreground next to a bare tree and a dark kiosk, with a tall illuminated building beyond. To the viewer's right, a modern reflective structure stands, mirroring the streetlights and distant buildings visible along the wet path leading into the background.

From the fourth frame, a red car appears in the far distance on the wet road to the left, gradually approaching. It continues moving towards the viewer, passing the tree in the mid-ground on the left, before exiting the frame in the bottom left foreground by the final frames.
