The first frame shows a wet street at night, looking down a multi-lane road from a sidewalk viewpoint. In the foreground, a tree with a red ribbon stands centrally, with a striped crosswalk to its left and a wet sidewalk with an umbrella and bags to its right. The midground features the reflective road lined with streetlights and red traffic signals, leading to distant buildings and trees in the background on both sides.

A yellow delivery scooter emerges from the right midground, traveling left across the wet road in front of the viewer. Subsequently, a blue van appears further back on the right midground, also moving leftward along the same road, passing the initial tree trunk on the right.

The first frame shows a rainy urban street at night, viewed from a slight elevation. In the immediate foreground-left, a wet crosswalk with white stripes and a right-pointing arrow abuts a red painted lane. To the foreground-right, a sidewalk holds a dark pole with a red traffic light, and at its base are white and blue bags along with white rolls. An outdoor dining area with a white umbrella is visible further to the right. The midground features a wet multi-lane road where a blue van is visible moving leftward, along with a partially visible yellow scooter on the far left. Numerous streetlights illuminate the scene, reflecting on the wet asphalt, and more red traffic lights and distant vehicle headlights are visible down the road under a dark, rainy sky.

The blue van, initially in the midground-left, proceeds leftward and exits the frame to the far left. Simultaneously, the yellow scooter on the far left of the midground also moves out of view to the left. Distant vehicles in the midground-center continue to move along the wet road, their headlights illuminating the rain, while the heavy rainfall persists throughout the scene.
