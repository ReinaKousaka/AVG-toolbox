The dark car, initially further ahead but behind the white van relative to the first-frame viewpoint, moves significantly closer to that initial viewpoint, eventually passing it to the viewer's left side. Concurrently, the white van and all buildings, including the 'Grindelwald' building on the left and the hotel on the right, also move closer to the initial first-frame viewpoint, revealing more of their facades and the immediate street environment.

The camera steadily progresses forward along the paved road. The white van, initially in the mid-center, recedes further into the distance ahead of the viewer. Concurrently, the person on the right sidewalk walks closer to the viewer, passing the parked cars, and eventually moves out of frame to the viewer's right. As the viewpoint advances, the buildings on both sides appear to draw nearer and then recede, revealing more of their facades, while a sidewalk drain on the right moves from the mid-right into the immediate foreground and passes beneath the viewer.
