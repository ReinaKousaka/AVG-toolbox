The first frame depicts a vibrant street scene with a white crosswalk directly in front of the viewer, leading away between multi-story buildings under a blue, partly cloudy sky. To the viewer's left, buildings house shops with an array of goods displayed on the sidewalk, including a large white umbrella covering a stall, and balconies adorned with flowers above. On the right, a building with shops and a blue container in the upper right corner is partially obscured by a wooden fence-like structure, while several pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks and one person with a hat is crossing the street from right to left in the mid-ground.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the person with the hat continues walking left across the crosswalk and exits the frame, while other pedestrians from the right side of the street move onto the crosswalk. Simultaneously, people on the left sidewalk progress further down the street, and a motorcycle emerges from the far right, approaching the intersection.

The first frame displays a vibrant street scene with multi-story buildings lining both sides; those on the left and center feature shops on the ground level and residences above, adorned with flower boxes, beneath a blue sky. To the far left, goods are stacked near a shop entrance, while on the right, a prominent pharmacy facade stands next to market stalls with people gathered around them. A pedestrian crossing is visible on the road in the mid-ground, where a trolley carrying a large white bag is positioned on the left sidewalk.
end of description
In the following frames, people on the left sidewalk continuously move both towards the viewer and deeper into the scene, while a person in blue walks from the mid-ground left towards the right sidewalk. The individuals gathered around the market stalls on the right show slight shifts in their positions, maintaining an overall active street environment without significant changes in the background buildings.

In the first frame, a bustling street scene unfolds with a large grey bag on a trolley in the immediate foreground, left. To its right, a crosswalk stretches across the mid-ground, leading towards multiple buildings that line both sides of the street. On the left sidewalk, two individuals in blue uniforms stand near a storefront, while farther right, several people are seated near a pharmacy recognizable by its green cross sign. Dominating the background on the right is a multi-story building with colorful windows, behind which a taller residential building is visible.
end of description
A red scooter, initially in the mid-ground center, begins moving forward and right across the crosswalk. Simultaneously, a person on the far right, near the pharmacy, starts walking further right and away from the viewer. The two individuals in blue on the left sidewalk also begin walking towards the right, and another pedestrian crosses the street from mid-ground left towards the background right. The red scooter continues its path, and the person on the far right moves towards the edge of the frame.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures a street scene with a red scooter carrying two children in the foreground-left, positioned before shopfronts and a multi-story building with colorful facades lining the left side. A pedestrian is mid-crossing the street from mid-left to mid-right, flanked by active sidewalks with people and vendors on both sides, with tall buildings rising in the distant background.
end of description
As frames progress, the red scooter and children move out of view to the left of their initial first-frame position, along with two boys previously on the left sidewalk. The pedestrian continues walking across the street from their mid-ground starting point towards the right, while the viewpoint slightly advances, revealing more of the street ahead.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a bustling urban street scene looking forward, flanked by multi-story buildings. On the left, a sidewalk features two individuals in construction gear, various storefronts, and parked motorcycles, backed by buildings with diverse colored facades. The right side has people seated at outdoor tables, a yellow warning sign, and a red 'no parking' sign, with buildings displaying red flowers in window boxes. The grey asphalt road, marked with white characters, leads into the midground where pedestrians and vehicles are visible, receding towards taller structures.

end of description

A person initially on the road, mid-right relative to the first-frame viewpoint, moves across to the right sidewalk and bends down by frame five. Concurrently, the two construction workers on the far left of the first frame exit the view to the left as a subtle forward camera movement reveals more of the street ahead, maintaining the buildings and parked motorcycles in their relative positions on either side.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a bustling urban street extending into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings. On the left, a sidewalk features parked motorcycles, pedestrians, and shops beneath a yellow building with many windows, while a street light stands prominently. On the right, a sidewalk hosts more pedestrians, market stalls with produce, and shops adorned with red and green facades and floral decorations. In the paved road's foreground, white arrows point forward, with a silver SUV in the midground and a very tall, light-colored high-rise building visible in the far background.
end of description
A person on a dark scooter, initially on the left side of the road near parked motorcycles, moves forward towards the distance. Concurrently, the silver SUV in the midground and a red vehicle further down the street also proceed away from the viewer. Pedestrians on both sidewalks move dynamically; notably, a small child and an adult on the right sidewalk become more prominent as they walk towards the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a bustling city street extending away from the viewer, lined on both sides by multi-story buildings with storefronts. On the left, buildings with blue and yellow facades feature storefronts, red lanterns, and planters, with pedestrians walking along the sidewalk. On the right, buildings with red and brown facades display flower boxes, signs including "XINHUA BOOK," and more pedestrians walking. A white SUV is parked on the left side of the road in the mid-ground, while a red vehicle and another car are visible further down the street, and tall residential-style buildings rise in the background.
end of description
The white SUV on the left side of the road slowly moves forward and away from the viewer, eventually showing its rear door slightly ajar. Pedestrians on both sidewalks continue walking away from the viewer, notably a person with a small child on the right. A bicycle becomes visible parked on the right sidewalk further down the street, and additional red lanterns become more prominent on the building facades as the scene progresses.
