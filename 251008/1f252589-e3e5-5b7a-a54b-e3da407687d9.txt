The first frame shows a dark, rain-soaked street at night, receding into the distance. A white decorative fence borders a sidewalk on the left, extending into the mid-ground, with a utility pole prominently in the far left foreground. On the right, another utility pole with yellow hazard stripes stands near a dark parked car, both in the foreground. The wet asphalt street with yellow edge lines reflects ambient light, and distant streetlights dimly illuminate more houses through the heavy rainfall.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the primary dynamic change is the continuous, heavy downpour, visible as intense streaks of rain constantly shifting and falling across the entire scene, causing reflections on the wet ground to shimmer, with no new objects or scenes revealed beyond the persistent precipitation.

The first frame captures a narrow, wet asphalt street at night, receding into a misty distance under heavy rainfall. To the viewer's left, a low concrete wall topped with a white and gray metal railing extends along the sidewalk, with greenery at its base and buildings beyond. On the right, a black car with a white roof is parked, its rear facing the viewer, adjacent to a yellow barrier, with other dark vehicles further down the street. The road features two yellow lines and leads towards a distant, misty streetlamp illuminating the falling rain.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the primary dynamic element is the continuous, heavy rainfall, visible as numerous streaks and droplets falling across the entire scene, reflecting light from the streetlamps. The individual rain streaks constantly shift and animate, creating a persistent sense of motion within the otherwise static street view, while all other visible objects and their spatial positions relative to the viewer remain fixed.

The first frame displays a wet, narrow street at night, looking forward from the viewer's perspective. On the left, a low fence with vertical bars runs along a grassy verge, leading to buildings further down the street. To the right, several dark cars are parked against dark residential buildings, one showing a brightly lit window on its upper floor. The road, marked by faded yellow dashed lines, recedes into a hazy, rainy distance, illuminated by a bright streetlamp where the street gently curves left. Numerous raindrops are visible falling throughout the air.

In the subsequent frames, the primary dynamic change is the continuous fall of raindrops, seen as shifting streaks and points of light across the scene, particularly highlighted against the distant streetlamp's glow. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the static elements like buildings and cars remain constant relative to the initial viewpoint, with only the rainfall depicting movement.
