The first frame shows a snow-covered wooden bridge railing extending from the lower left towards the center-left. Beyond the railing and below the viewer is a partially frozen river with visible water amidst snow and ice chunks, flowing from the foreground towards a dense, snow-covered evergreen forest in the background. The banks on both sides of the river, as well as the forest, are heavily laden with snow.
end of description
In the following frames, snow is observed dynamically falling and blowing from the branches of the snow-covered evergreen trees, primarily on the right side of the river and further into the background forest, creating a subtle, continuous downward movement.
