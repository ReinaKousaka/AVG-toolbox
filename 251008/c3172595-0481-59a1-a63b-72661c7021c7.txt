The first frame displays a street scene with a paved road extending into the distance, bordered by sidewalks and multi-story buildings. On the left, a building adorned with red and white striped awnings and multiple hanging flags houses shops. The right sidewalk features a black 'COMBO MENU' sandwich board, a red table with white chairs, and a tree with vibrant green leaves further ahead. A dark grey car is visible on the street in the midground, moving away from the viewer, with mountains forming the backdrop under a bright sky.

Initially, the dark grey car on the street recedes further away from the viewer. Subsequently, a person on a bicycle, wearing a purple jacket, enters from the left side of the street and proceeds across the midground towards the right, moving further into the distance. A dark grey SUV then emerges from the left, following the bicyclist down the street. Both the bicyclist and the SUV continue to recede into the distance, with a white car becoming visible further behind them on the street.
