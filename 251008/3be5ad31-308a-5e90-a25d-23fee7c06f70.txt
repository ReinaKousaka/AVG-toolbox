The first frame captures a stone-paved walkway extending away from the viewer, bordered on the right by a rough stone wall with two arched window openings and on the left by a red metal railing overlooking a body of water filled with numerous small boats. In the distance, hazy mountains are visible beyond the water, and two people walk away from the viewer on the walkway towards a red-facaded building with a white awning further down the path.

In the following frames, the two individuals continue to walk further away from the initial viewpoint, receding into the distance. Concurrently, the camera subtly advances forward and shifts slightly right relative to the first-frame viewpoint, causing the stone wall on the right to become more prominent and revealing a small yellow sign attached to it. The boats on the left remain docked, their perspective subtly changing with the camera's forward movement.

In the first frame, a textured stone wall occupies the right foreground, featuring two arched openings, one partially visible. To the left, a paved walkway extends into the distance, bordered by a red railing overlooking a body of water with numerous small boats docked below. Two individuals, one in a dark jacket and one in a light jacket, walk away from the background on the paved path, with a red building displaying a "GELATERIA" sign and a white awning to their right. In the far background, hazy mountains rise under an overcast sky, with a long red pier-like structure visible across the water.

The two individuals continue walking along the paved walkway, steadily approaching the viewer's first-frame viewpoint from the midground. They pass the red building with the "GELATERIA" sign on their right. The scene otherwise remains static, with no new objects or areas becoming visible.
