frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame depicts a street scene from a crosswalk beneath an elevated concrete structure. A person's back, wearing a dark coat, is in the immediate right foreground, and a masked person on a phone is to the left; buildings, signs, and distant pedestrians are visible straight ahead.
end of description
The foreground figures begin walking forward across the crosswalk, revealing more of the street and buildings directly ahead. The masked individual moves left of the original viewpoint, while the person in the dark coat moves further right. More pedestrians emerge onto the crosswalk from the left and right, crossing the path relative to the first-frame viewpoint, including a person with a backpack becoming prominent as they cross from left to right.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
In the first frame, three people walk away from the viewer on a crosswalk in the foreground, positioned right of a large white pillar on the viewer's left. An elevated structure spans overhead, and beyond the people, a pedestrian walkway leads into the distance towards city buildings featuring prominent billboards.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward, accompanying the pedestrians as they continue down the walkway, thereby revealing more of the street scene to the left of the initial pillar. The foreground individuals recede further into the midground, and new pedestrians emerge from the distant street ahead, approaching the viewer's original position from the right.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows the viewer under a concrete overpass, looking down a sidewalk flanked by a pillar on the left and a fence on the right, with a man and woman walking away in the foreground towards a distant city street lined with buildings, advertisements, a blue truck, and parked bicycles.
end of description
As the camera slowly advances, the foreground pedestrians move further into the distance, and more individuals are revealed walking along the street ahead. A new person also emerges from the right side of the frame, walking away from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures an urban street under a concrete overpass, with pedestrians walking away from the viewer on a central sidewalk. To the left, parked bicycles and a partially visible blue bus are present, with buildings displaying signs like 'ヨドバシ' further down, while a black fence lines the sidewalk on the right leading towards distant buildings, bare trees, and a clear sky.
end of description
Subsequently, the camera subtly advances as the initial foreground pedestrians continue moving further away. The two women, originally located in the distant background, progressively approach the viewer, becoming more prominent. Simultaneously, a cyclist emerges from the far right behind the fence, moving closer towards the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a busy urban street scene unfolds. To the immediate left, a light-colored pillar stands vertically, partially obscuring two women walking away from the viewer towards the right; the woman closer to the viewer has dark hair and a fluffy collar. Ahead, three individuals walk away from the viewer on a paved sidewalk, with a black metal fence running parallel to their right. In the midground, a zebra crossing spans a street bustling with pedestrians and bicycles, flanked by tall buildings on the left with visible Japanese signage and a large billboard advertisement. Further down the street, more buildings of varying heights and colors are visible under a clear blue sky.

end of description

As the viewpoint moves forward through subsequent frames, the two women initially on the viewer's left exit the frame to the right. The pillar on the far left recedes, revealing more of the street and sidewalk to its left, while the three people walking ahead move further into the distance. A blue truck, previously further down the street to the left of the viewer's path, becomes more prominent and closer as the viewpoint approaches the pedestrian crossing, expanding the visible street scene.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, two silhouetted figures with their backs to the viewer stand on a crosswalk in the immediate foreground, facing a bustling city street. To the far right, a black metal fence-like structure is visible. Beyond the crosswalk, a busy sidewalk to the left hosts pedestrians and parked bicycles, while a blue truck is partially visible on the far left. A large building with blue and white signs (including 'MEGA' and 'カラオケ') and a prominent advertisement dominates the mid-ground, with other buildings and bare trees extending down a street to the right, under a clear blue sky. Taller buildings and skyscrapers form the background on the right.
end of description
The two main foreground figures continue to walk forward across the crosswalk. A third, smaller silhouetted individual, initially partially obscured, emerges to walk between and slightly behind them, moving towards the mid-ground relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The rightmost foreground person momentarily turns their head towards the newly revealed central figure as they all progress. Concurrently, a white van on the street to the right gradually drives further away into the distance. Other pedestrians on the mid-ground sidewalk also exhibit minor movements.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
Three individuals are prominently in the foreground, seen from behind, standing on a white crosswalk. To the left, a multi-story building displays large signs, including 'マルチメディア', 'P' for parking, and 'カラオケ', with an advertisement featuring faces, and pedestrians including a person on a bicycle on the sidewalk below. To the right and center, a street extends into the distance, with a white van parked on the far right and other buildings and bare trees lining the road under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The three foreground figures begin walking forward across the crosswalk, moving away from the viewer. The traffic light on the left side, above the sidewalk, changes from red to green. Concurrently, the person on the bicycle on the far left proceeds forward. A fourth individual emerges from the viewer's right side, joining the group on the crosswalk and walking forward with them.
