The first frame presents a nighttime city street scene, with illuminated buildings towering on both sides. To the left, a building prominently displays an "Abercrombie & Fitch" sign, while to the right, a large facade features vibrant abstract art and a "Dior" sign. A street runs down the center, traversed by a white car moving left-to-right across a pedestrian crossing in the mid-left, with other distant vehicles further down the road. On the right-hand sidewalk, a pedestrian in light clothing stands near the foreground, facing away from the viewer.

The white car proceeds further to the right, moving past the pedestrian crossing. A dark car emerges from the left in the mid-ground, following the same path rightward. Concurrently, a new pedestrian, an older man, enters the frame from the far right on the sidewalk, walking left towards the viewer. The dark car continues across the pedestrian crossing as the older man becomes more visible in the right foreground.
