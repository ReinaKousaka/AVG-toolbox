The first frame depicts a wet city sidewalk at night, extending into the distance on the left, reflecting overhead lights. A tall dark pole with a white 'MONTHLY PARKING AVAILABLE' sign is prominent in the foreground to the right. To the left, a building facade features large windows, one displaying a white circular blue 'P' parking sign and "Garage Parking Elevators", followed by a section with colorful abstract graffiti, all beneath an overhead glass canopy. On the right, a wet street reflects lights, with a dark car, its headlights on, driving away from the viewer, while string lights adorn trees lining the street. Tall, dimly lit city buildings rise in the background, with a green traffic light visible further down the street on the right.

The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the wet sidewalk. The tall pole in the foreground on the right gradually moves out of frame to the right as the camera advances. As the camera progresses, the parking signs and colorful graffiti on the building facade to the left become increasingly prominent and closer. The street, illuminated trees, and the car to the right continuously scroll past, maintaining their relative positions ahead as the viewer moves forward.

The first frame depicts a wet city street at night, looking forward along a sidewalk to the left. A building facade on the left features large white panels and a vibrant pink wall with a blue and teal mural, covered by an overhead glass awning reflecting lights. To the right, a tree wrapped in fairy lights stands next to a glistening wet street where a dark car with headlights on is visible in the midground, reflecting on the pavement.

As the viewpoint progresses forward, the building facade and mural on the left move past the viewer and recede behind, revealing more of the sidewalk and storefronts further down the street. The tree adorned with lights and a blue signpost to its right also move past the viewer, with a small bench becoming visible beside the tree's base. The wet street and the dark car ahead appear to draw closer as the perspective shifts, deepening the view into the urban landscape.

The first frame depicts a wet city street at night with glowing reflections. To the left, a building with a colorful mural and a neon green wall is covered by a glass canopy, while on the right, a lamp post and an A-frame sign stand beside a dark blue car with headlights on a wet road with a green bike lane.
end of description
As the camera moves forward and slightly to the right from the initial viewpoint, the muraled wall on the far left gradually moves out of view. Simultaneously, a garage entrance with a prominent 'P' sign overhead becomes fully visible on the left. The A-frame sign on the right moves further back and right, as the car on the street continues to drive forward and slightly right, revealing more of the illuminated city street ahead.
