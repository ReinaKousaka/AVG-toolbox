In the first frame, a man in a dark coat walks right across the sunlit sidewalk in the foreground, passing a silver fire hydrant; behind him, to the left, steps lead to a brick building where another person sits, while further right in the midground, multiple individuals are seated outside a storefront, with a digital display and distant vehicles visible on the far right street.

Over subsequent frames, the man in the dark coat continues walking right across the foreground, while shadows on the sidewalk progressively lengthen and shift rightward across the midground. A new man, in a light shirt and hat, then emerges from the far right midground, walking left past the storefront with a bag, as more pedestrians appear further down the street.

In the first frame, a man in a dark coat walks towards the viewer on the left, while another man in a t-shirt, khaki pants, and cap walks away to the right, carrying a white bag, positioned in the midground. To the left, a brick building with storefronts and steps lines the sidewalk, and on the right, a pole with a digital display board stands. The background shows a street with cars and pedestrians further down.

In the following frames, both men continue walking: the man in the dark coat moves further left, and the man with the bag moves further right, away from the first-frame viewpoint. Other pedestrians and vehicles on the street also progress along their paths relative to their initial positions.
