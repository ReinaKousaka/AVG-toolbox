In the first frame, a bustling city street scene unfolds under a clear blue sky. In the immediate right foreground, a person with long wavy hair, wearing a black jacket and grey pants, strides left across a striped crosswalk, carrying a light-colored tote bag. To the viewer's left, a storefront with large reflective windows showcases a yellow A-frame sign on the sidewalk promoting "VEGAN BURRITO." Further down the sidewalk on the mid-left, another person in a leopard print coat walks away from the viewer, while slightly ahead and closer to the street, a third person in a dark jacket and jeans also walks away. A blue mailbox stands by the curb in the mid-right, adjacent to a street pole bearing traffic lights and signs for "W 26th ST," "ONE WAY," and "1st AVE." Numerous multi-story buildings line both sides of the street, stretching into the background where more distant skyscrapers are visible, with several parked cars on the street between the pedestrian and far buildings.

As the frames progress, the person in the right foreground continues walking left across the crosswalk, moving further into the scene and gradually exiting the lower left of the frame. The other two pedestrians (the person in the dark jacket and jeans in the mid-center, and the person in the leopard print coat on the mid-left) also advance further away from the viewer down the street. The crosswalk in the immediate foreground becomes clearer, and more of the sidewalk directly to the viewer's left is revealed. The buildings and street furniture like the traffic pole and blue mailbox remain spatially fixed relative to the first-frame viewpoint, appearing slightly more distant as the scene subtly pans forward.

In the first frame, a bustling city sidewalk is visible, with a woman in a black jacket and grey pants walking away from the viewer in the foreground-right. To her left, a blue mailbox stands, and further left are two other pedestrians also walking away from the viewer. On the far left, a yellow 'VEGAN BURRITO' sandwich board sign stands before storefronts, while to the right, a street with parked cars, a crosswalk, and tall city buildings under a clear blue sky extends into the background.
end of description
The woman in the foreground continues walking away from the viewer, moving past the blue mailbox which remains stationary to her left. Concurrently, the other pedestrians in the midground also progress further down the sidewalk away from the viewer. A yellow taxi cab appears on the street to the right, gradually moving from right to left across the frame.

In the first frame, a sidewalk with pedestrians walking away from the viewer occupies the left half, with storefronts and buildings lining the left side. A woman with long brown hair, wearing a black jacket and grey pants, walks away from the viewer slightly right of center, holding a light bag. To her immediate right is a blue USPS mailbox, and further right is a green bike lane next to a street with parked and moving cars, including a yellow taxi/van and a white sedan. Tall buildings stand in the background under a blue sky, with a yellow traffic light high on the right. A partially visible yellow sign is in the far foreground to the left.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the sidewalk, causing the yellow sign on the far left to disappear and the blue mailbox to gradually move to the far right of the frame, partially exiting it. The woman in the foreground continues walking away, her figure remaining largely centered as the street and bike lane open up more to the right. The pedestrians ahead on the left sidewalk recede into the distance, and a white SUV previously obscured by the white sedan on the street becomes visible further down on the right. The white sedan moves forward on the street, passing other vehicles, as the overall urban scene progresses with the viewer's movement.
