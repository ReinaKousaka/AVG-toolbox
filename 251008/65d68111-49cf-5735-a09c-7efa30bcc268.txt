The first frame shows a rainy street scene with a wet sidewalk and road. To the left, a storefront with "kt" signage and a colorful balloon arch is visible, with two people walking away from the viewer under clear umbrellas. Further down the sidewalk, to the left of the viewer, another person walks with a dark umbrella. To the right, a traffic light post with a green pedestrian signal displaying "3" stands beside a wet road where a white truck and several cars with headlights on are driving away from the viewer. Four black bollards with yellow tops are positioned on the sidewalk, two to the left and two to the right, closest to the viewer.
end of description
The pedestrian traffic light to the right of the viewer progressively counts down from "3" to "0" and then turns off. Simultaneously, the two individuals with clear umbrellas, initially in the mid-ground walking away on the left sidewalk, continuously move further down the street, gradually closing the distance to the third person with a dark umbrella. The white truck on the far right of the street, moving away from the viewer, also proceeds further into the distance. By the final frame, all three people and the truck have moved significantly farther from the initial viewpoint.
