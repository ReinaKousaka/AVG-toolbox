A living room is shown with a dark red recliner chair on the left and a long matching sofa extending to the right, both facing the viewer. Behind them, large glass sliding doors and patterned curtains overlook an outdoor patio, while a media console with a TV and shelves lines the right wall. A small wooden side table and a wall-mounted lamp are also visible on the left side.

The view slowly pans to the right, causing the entire scene to shift left across the frame. As the camera pans, more of the right-side wall and a white door, initially beyond the media console, are revealed relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, a remote control and magazines become visible on the small wooden side table, which is situated between the recliner and the sliding doors.
