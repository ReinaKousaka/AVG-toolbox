In the first frame, a person wearing a white cap, red vest, and blue shorts, holding trekking poles, is running away from the viewer on a light brown dirt path that gently ascends. To the right of the path, a grassy bank leads to a dense treeline, while to the left, a steep green hillside slopes down to reveal a building nestled among trees and further forested hills in the distance. Overlays showing distance progress on the left and speed/time data on the bottom right are visible.

In the following frames, the runner continues forward on the same path, moving further away from the initial viewpoint, with the surrounding landscape of green hills and dense forests receding proportionally. The view remains consistent, indicating steady progression through the mountainous terrain located ahead and to the sides of the viewer. The data displayed in the bottom right corner updates to reflect minor changes in pace and the increasing elapsed time, with no new objects or scenes becoming visible.
