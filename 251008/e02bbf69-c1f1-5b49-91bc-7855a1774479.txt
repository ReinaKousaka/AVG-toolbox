The first frame shows a forward-facing view down a set of train tracks, receding into the distance and curving gently to the left, flanked by green vegetation and forests under an overcast sky. To the immediate left, a dense forest of tall evergreen and some deciduous trees lines the track, while to the right, a sloped area with tree stumps and sparse green growth leads to a denser evergreen forest further back. A wooden utility pole with overhead wires stands to the right of the tracks in the midground, and distant hills are visible beyond the forests. "Vmax: 100KM/H" is displayed in the bottom left corner.
end of description
As the train moves forward, the landscape rushes towards and past the viewer, with the tracks continuously appearing directly in front. A yellow-lit railway signal post, initially distant and slightly right of the track center, progressively approaches and moves past the viewer's left side. Simultaneously, the utility pole, first to the right of the tracks, approaches and passes the viewer's right. The surrounding forests and ground on both sides continuously shift from the distance towards the viewer's periphery. A small fox head icon also appears in the bottom-right corner and remains static through subsequent frames.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a first-person perspective view looking down a set of railroad tracks that extend into the distant horizon. On the immediate left, a blurred signal pole with yellow signs stands, flanked by a dense forest. To the right, a grassy embankment borders a clear-cut forest area that transitions into dense forest further back. A utility pole with overhead wires is visible in the mid-right, and the distant background features hills under a cloudy sky. The text "Vmax 100KM/h" appears in the bottom left corner.

end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the signal pole on the immediate left quickly passes out of view. The railroad tracks and adjacent green embankments continuously appear from the foreground ahead and rapidly move under and to the sides of the viewer. The utility pole initially visible in the mid-right approaches, passes to the viewer's right, and new segments of dense forest on the left and clear-cut land on the right are continuously revealed ahead. Another utility pole then emerges and passes to the right, as the distant forested hills and sky in the background remain relatively stable while closer elements rush past.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays train tracks extending directly forward into the distance, flanked on the left by a dense green forest and on the right by a mix of forest and a cleared area. Overhead, power lines and a distant pole are visible, all beneath a blue-grey sky, while 'Vmax 100KM/H' appears in the bottom-left corner.
end of description
As the viewpoint rapidly moves forward along the tracks, the landscape on both sides continuously shifts. New sections of dense forest on the left and varying terrain on the right appear from the distant foreground, pass by the viewer, and recede behind, with a power pole also passing on the right.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a straight train track receding into the distance, flanked by dense forests; evergreens are on the left, a mix of trees on the right. Overhead, multiple power lines converge under a light blue-gray sky, with a faint distant mountain range visible. Gravel and green vegetation line the tracks in the foreground, accompanied by a speed indicator 'Vmax: 100KM/H' and a logo.
end of description
The following frames show the train moving rapidly forward along the tracks. Objects like the yellow marker initially to the left and a power line support pole on the right approach, pass by the viewer, and recede behind the first-frame viewpoint. The surrounding forests and trackside vegetation continuously shift and blur with motion, revealing new sections of the environment ahead of the initial viewpoint as the journey progresses.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a straight train track receding into the distance from the viewer's foreground, bordered by dense dark green forest on both sides. Overhead catenary wires are supported by a pole visible on the right mid-ground, with a pale, overcast sky above and distant hills. A small yellow signal sign is faintly visible far down the tracks.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses rapidly along the tracks, the ground and forest on either side blur and recede behind the viewer. The initial catenary pole on the right swiftly moves past to the viewer's right, while new poles and the distant yellow signal gradually emerge from straight ahead, approaching the viewer's position.
