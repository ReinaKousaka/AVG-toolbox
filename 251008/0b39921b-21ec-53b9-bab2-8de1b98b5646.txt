A snow-covered paved walkway extends into the distance at night, lined with streetlights and trees, some adorned with string lights. Several large planter bowls with snow and greenery populate the foreground, with a trash can on the right, and buildings stand on both sides of the path. In the mid-distance to the right, an illuminated Christmas tree stands beside a white building, and two individuals walk along the path.

The camera then slowly pans right, causing the large Christmas tree on the far right to gradually move further right and out of view. Simultaneously, more of the white building on the right is revealed, and a smaller, decorated evergreen tree in a planter emerges on the right side of the path, while the two walking individuals eventually exit the frame to the right.
