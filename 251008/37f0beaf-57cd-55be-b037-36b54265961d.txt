The first frame depicts a covered sidewalk with scaffolding overhead. To the left, a blue payment machine and a bus shelter with a large wave advertisement are visible, while to the right, shuttered storefronts with metal gates line the path. A person in a dark shirt and hat sits on the ground near the right-side storefronts, and three pedestrians walk away from the viewer down the center of the covered walkway, with a street and buildings in the background.
end of description
The three walking pedestrians continue moving further away into the background. Concurrently, a man in a light green shirt, who was part of the walking group, stops and turns to face the sitting person on the right, taking a slight step backward. The sitting person shifts their posture and glances upwards as new pedestrians become visible further down the walkway in the distant background.

In the first frame, a covered pedestrian walkway under scaffolding dominates the scene. To the foreground right, a person in a black cap and t-shirt sits on the ground, facing left. In the mid-ground right, a man in a light green tie-dye shirt and shorts stands, holding a phone, with a black scooter behind him and a metal-shuttered storefront further right. Down the sidewalk in the mid-ground center, three people walk away from the viewer. On the left, a glass-paneled structure with advertisements borders a street where cars and distant buildings are visible.
end of description
The man in the light green shirt moves from the mid-ground right towards the viewer, then walks past the viewer's right side and out of the frame. As he progresses, more of the metal-shuttered storefront previously behind him on the right becomes visible. Simultaneously, the three people in the mid-ground center continue walking further away from the viewer down the sidewalk. The seated person in the foreground right remains stationary throughout.

The first frame shows the viewer positioned under a scaffolding structure, looking down a bustling city sidewalk. Scaffolding poles and crossbars frame the view on the immediate left and right, supporting an overhead structure. To the left, a glass bus stop shelter with advertisements partially obscures a street where a dark car is visible further down. To the right, a storefront with a closed metal shutter is on the far right, and a black scooter is parked closer to the viewer near a reflective shop window. Several pedestrians are walking away from the viewer along the central sidewalk, with a person in a dark shirt and black pants most prominent, leading towards a street scene with more buildings, traffic, and trees in the background.

end of description

The viewer slowly moves forward, causing the scaffolding and immediate sidewalk to subtly shift perspective. The pedestrians, including the person in the dark shirt and others with a white umbrella, continue walking further down the sidewalk away from the original viewpoint. A car to the far left also advances slightly, while reflections in the right-side storefront windows subtly change due to the viewer's progression.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a city street view from within a shelter, showing metal frames and reflective glass panels in the immediate foreground. On the midground sidewalk, a black trash can and a yellow cart are to the left, while several pedestrians, including a woman in blue and a man with a backpack, walk away from the viewer. To the right, a street vendor's stand with colorful goods, an A-frame sign, and a black scooter are visible. The background shows a street with cars, a traffic light, and buildings lining both sides under a clear sky.
end of description
As frames progress, the man in the grey shirt and backpack walks distinctly closer to the viewer's position, while other pedestrians continue moving further away. The 'AT&T' logo on the A-frame sign to the right becomes more clearly visible as slight changes occur in lighting or perspective.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a dark-skinned man wearing a hat, grey t-shirt, and shorts with a backpack walks directly towards the viewer on the left sidewalk, near a black trash can. To the viewer's right, an 'AT&T' sandwich board sign stands next to a sitting man, a red cooler, and a street vendor cart displaying items like colorful cotton candy, all in front of a glass storefront. In the midground, several pedestrians are walking away from the viewer on the sidewalk, with a street lined with parked and moving cars and various buildings and shops on both sides extending into the background, where trees and a traffic light are also visible under a blue sky.
end of description
The man in the foreground walks closer to the viewer, then begins to exit the frame on the left. Other pedestrians on the sidewalk continue moving further away from the viewer, while a woman in white pants and a cream top moves from the background into the midground, stopping near the street vendor cart on the left. Concurrently, a man in a red hat enters the scene from the background, walking forward into the midground, and vehicular traffic on the street continues to flow.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a lively street scene featuring a man seated by a red vendor cart with cotton candy and snacks on the right, and another man near a metal cart on the left, closer to a yellow dispenser. In the midground, a woman stands between the carts, while a man in a red cap and backpack approaches the viewer, and another woman walks away into the street. Distant buildings, storefronts, and cars line the background under a clear sky.
end of description
Subsequent frames show the man in the red cap and backpack, initially in the midground, walking progressively closer to the viewer and eventually exiting to the far left of the frame. Concurrently, the woman previously standing in the midground moves left and slightly away, while the woman walking into the background continues to recede further from the viewer's perspective. The two seated vendors and their carts remain stationary.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a bustling street scene. To the immediate right, a vendor cart displaying colorful items and boxes is partially visible. In the midground, a woman in a blue shirt and black pants stands with her back mostly to the viewer, holding a black bag, alongside another woman in grey shorts. A person in a red cap is partially visible on the far left. A silver sedan drives left-to-right across the midground intersection, beyond which are buildings, including a "FINEST ITALIAN GYRO" restaurant on the right and a yellow building on the left, under a blue sky with street signs and traffic lights overhead.
end of description
As frames progress, the person in the red cap fully exits the left of the frame. Concurrently, a new woman in a white jacket enters from the far left, moving forward into the midground. The silver sedan continues its movement left-to-right, transitioning further into the background relative to the initial viewpoint. The woman in the blue shirt turns to face more towards the viewer, looking down at an item and revealing a brown paper bag in her hand. A person on a bicycle, initially in the mid-background right, advances slightly towards the foreground.
