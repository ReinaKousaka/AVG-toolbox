The first frame presents a rainy city street with a wide white-striped crosswalk spanning the foreground. A man holding an umbrella is seen crossing the street from the left towards the right, positioned centrally on the crosswalk. On the left, buildings with businesses like "다라플란트치과" and "KT" are visible, while an orange-toned building lines the right, both sidewalks occupied by other pedestrians with umbrellas, and a blue vehicle's front is visible on the far right. Vehicles are stationary further down the wet street, with residential buildings and trees in the distant background.

Over the subsequent frames, the man with the umbrella continues his path across the crosswalk, moving progressively towards the right and slightly further away from the first-frame viewpoint until he exits the frame on the right. Other pedestrians on the sidewalks, remaining to the left and right of the street respectively, also exhibit slight movements forward. The street remains wet from the rain.

The first frame presents a wet asphalt street with a black and white striped pedestrian crossing directly in front of the viewer. To the left, a person holding a black umbrella walks on the sidewalk next to a building displaying "치과" and "KT" signs, behind which a gray car is parked on the street facing away. The street extends into the distance, reflecting red brake lights from several distant vehicles. On the right, a building with "emart Everyday" signage stands, with people visible on the sidewalk under awnings, while trees and a street lamp line this side of the road. Tall buildings rise in the overcast background.

The person with the black umbrella on the left side of the road continues walking from left to right, moving across the pedestrian crossing in front of the viewer. The gray car, initially parked to the left of the crossing, begins to move slowly forward into the distance. A person on the right sidewalk, initially near the "emart Everyday" sign, also progresses forward relative to their first-frame position. These movements cause subtle shifts in the reflections on the wet road.

The first frame displays a wet city street featuring a pedestrian crosswalk in the midground. Buildings line both sides, with a storefront decorated by a colorful arch on the left and an E-mart with stairs on the right. A person holding an umbrella is positioned on the crosswalk, walking from left to right, with several parked cars to their left and tall buildings visible in the background.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the person with the umbrella continues their progression across the crosswalk, moving further towards the right side of the frame and away from the viewer.
