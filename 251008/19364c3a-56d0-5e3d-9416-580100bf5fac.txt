The first frame shows a wet city street at night, with closed storefronts featuring colorful striped roller shutters on the right, and a tall glass-fronted building, a bus stop shelter, and bare trees lining the left side, all receding into the illuminated distance.

Rain appears to intensify slightly throughout the scene. A bicycle then emerges on the left sidewalk, closer to the viewer and in front of the bus stop. Subsequently, a silver car drives past the bus stop on the wet road on the left, moving further away from the viewer.

The first frame displays a wet, nighttime city street scene. On the immediate right, several storefronts with closed, horizontally striped roller shutters in pink, blue, yellow, and red are visible beneath a dark awning. To the left, a bus stop shelter with a blue sign depicting a bus and arrows stands beside a wet sidewalk and bare trees. The street ahead reflects numerous city lights on its slick surface, with more buildings and trees receding into the distant gloom under a dark sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly shifts forward and slightly to the right along the street. Objects initially on the far right, like the colorful striped shutters, move further left across the frame. Simultaneously, new storefronts that were originally outside the first frame's right edge are progressively revealed. Specifically, an open storefront with a glass door and white promotional posters, located further down the street and to the right of the initially visible shops, becomes prominent.

The first frame captures a rainy night scene on an urban street, viewed from a fixed forward perspective. On the upper left, a blue rectangular sign with a white bus icon and Korean text marks a bus-only lane. Below this, two kiosk-like structures stand on the left, followed by bare trees lining the wet street that recedes into the misty distance. To the right, a row of multi-story buildings showcases numerous illuminated signs, including "KB 국민은행" (KB Kookmin Bank) and "부동산" (Real Estate), with many storefronts appearing closed by roll-down shutters. The entire street surface in the foreground and extending into the background is wet and highly reflective, mirroring the bright neon signs and distant streetlights under a dark, overcast sky.

The subsequent frames primarily depict the ongoing, moderate rainfall visibly falling throughout the entire scene, from the dark sky to the thoroughly drenched street. The continuous impact of the rain causes subtle ripples and shimmering effects on the reflective puddles covering the pavement, which extends from the foreground into the far background. No new objects or scenes are revealed, and the overall spatial arrangement of the environment remains constant relative to the initial viewpoint.
