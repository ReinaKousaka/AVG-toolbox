In the first frame, partial views of two scooters are on the bottom left, a planter with green and red foliage is centrally located, and a red barrier is at the far right. In the midground, a male pedestrian walks rightward on a crosswalk past a trash can to the left, while several metal barriers line the street center. Behind these, a white SUV and a dark SUV are visible, and a white sedan is stopped to the mid-right with a female pedestrian in an orange striped shirt standing next to it. The background displays city buildings with colorful murals, a traffic light (yellow) overhead to the right, and an overcast sky.

Following frames show the white sedan, initially in the mid-right, moving forward and turning left, exiting the scene towards the left. The male pedestrian continues walking leftward across the crosswalk, moving further into the mid-left. Concurrently, the white and dark SUVs behind the central metal barriers progress slightly forward towards the left. A cyclist emerges from the background-right, traveling diagonally leftward into the mid-right foreground, becoming clearly visible by the end, occupying the space vacated by the sedan. The female pedestrian on the right remains largely static.
