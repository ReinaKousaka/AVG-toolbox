The first frame shows the viewer on a multi-lane road, following directly behind a yellow bus on a wet asphalt surface marked with white dashed lines. To the left, a concrete barrier separates the lane from a busy road leading towards a multi-tiered elevated highway system and several distant skyscrapers. On the right, a white barrier borders a sidewalk where two individuals on scooters are visible, beyond which are trees and multi-story brick buildings under an overcast sky. A navigation map overlay in the top-left corner displays the current route, road names, and the viewer's position.

The viewpoint steadily moves forward, causing the distant buildings, elevated highway, and roadside structures on both sides to recede from view. The yellow bus ahead also moves forward, maintaining a consistent distance from the viewer's vehicle. Throughout the sequence, the small red indicator lights on the upper rear of the bus intermittently illuminate and extinguish, suggesting braking or signaling. Concurrently, the navigation map's blue arrow progresses along the highlighted route, reflecting the vehicle's continuous movement.

The first frame captures a multi-lane city road under an overcast sky, viewed from behind a yellow bus in the right lane. An elevated highway with traffic is to the far left, a sidewalk with pedestrians and a scooter to the right, and a complex network of overpasses, tall buildings, and a tree-covered hill forms the backdrop, along with a navigation overlay in the top-left.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewer's vehicle and the yellow bus ahead move forward along the road, gradually revealing more of the path ahead. The pedestrians and scooter initially visible on the right sidewalk are progressively left behind, moving further away from the viewer's advancing perspective. The distant elevated highways and urban structures slowly appear to approach as the scene unfolds.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
A road with white lane markings stretches ahead of the viewer. To the right, a yellow bus is positioned in front, moving away, with a metal barrier and green foliage along the far right edge. On the left, a concrete barrier with a yellow railing runs alongside the road. In the distance, an elevated expressway spans the scene, with tall buildings visible beneath and beyond it, under an overcast sky. A navigation map overlay is present in the top-left corner.
end of description
The yellow bus in front of the viewer gradually moves further ahead and slightly to the right, away from the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the white bus in the distance also recedes further down the road, maintaining its position relative to the yellow bus. No new objects are revealed, only the progressive movement of the vehicles away from the viewer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a multi-lane road extends forward from the viewer, bordered on the left by a curving concrete overpass structure with a green construction barrier below it. To the immediate right, a large yellow and pink public bus partially obstructs the view, displaying its rear and side. Further down the road, a white bus is visible in the distance, while multiple elevated roadways crisscross the background, with distant city buildings beneath a cloudy sky. A navigation map overlay is present in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the road; the yellow and pink bus to the right advances, revealing more of the adjacent buildings and a blue road sign. Concurrently, the white bus ahead on the road approaches closer to the viewer. The green construction barrier on the left side extends further back, showcasing more details and text on its panels.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a large pink, orange, and yellow bus is positioned on the right, close to the viewer. A paved road with white arrow markings (straight and left-turn) extends forward, bordered on the left by a green construction barrier. Further ahead on the road, a white bus is followed by a white car, both centered in the lane. Overhead, multiple concrete highway overpasses span the scene, with high-rise buildings visible in the distant background beneath them, under an overcast sky. A navigation map overlay is present in the top-left corner.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the white car, initially behind the white bus in the central lane, accelerates and overtakes the bus, moving progressively further ahead relative to the viewer. The pink and orange bus on the viewer's right remains largely stationary, while the viewer's perspective also subtly advances along the road. This progression reveals more of the road markings and the continuing highway structures ahead.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a road, facing a complex urban interchange. Directly in front, a white arrow indicates a straight path, while another to its right points right. A blue and white bus occupies the left foreground, displaying its rear and partial left side. To the right foreground, the front-right side of a pink bus is visible. Above and to the left of the blue bus, a yellow barrier arm with a blue circular sign is extended. Overhead, an imposing concrete elevated road structure spans the width of the frame, with more elevated roads winding into the midground. Beyond these structures, several tall buildings rise against a grey sky, and trees line the right side of the street, next to white barriers near the pink bus.
end of description
The blue bus on the left moves forward, revealing a dark SUV behind it, which then proceeds into the left lane previously occupied by the bus. Simultaneously, the pink bus on the right also moves forward, opening up the view to a person on a bicycle and more of the sidewalk to its right. As both buses and the SUV move away from the viewer, more of the road ahead and the intricate elevated road supports become visible, expanding the central street view.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a multi-layered urban overpass system dominating the left and central view, with an asphalt road and crosswalk in the foreground, and distant high-rise buildings visible on the right. To the left under the overpass, a bus and a yellow truck are present, while on the right, people are on a sidewalk near trees and traffic lights showing green for straight.
end of description
Subsequently, the traffic lights on the right change, with the bottom light turning green and the left traffic light under the overpass turning red. A white car then emerges from under the overpass on the mid-left, moving across the viewer's path from left to right. Concurrently, a person on a bicycle crosses the road from right to left in front of the viewer, followed by another person on a scooter entering the crosswalk as the left traffic light turns green.
