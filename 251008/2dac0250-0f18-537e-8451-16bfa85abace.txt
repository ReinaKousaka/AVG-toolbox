A wet city street at night is visible, with a brick-patterned sidewalk on the right leading into the mid-ground, and a wet road with a zebra crossing on the left foreground. A dark car with illuminated headlights is positioned on the left, near the zebra crossing. In the mid-ground, a tall utility pole stands on the sidewalk, flanked by trees and buildings with various glowing signs lining both sides of the street. A bright, illuminated storefront on the right features a green freestanding sign, while distant buildings and a red traffic light further down the street fade into the rainy background.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the dark car on the left side of the street gradually moves forward, crossing the zebra crossing and proceeding further away from the viewer along the wet road. The reflections on the road and sidewalk consistently indicate falling rain, which contributes to a slightly hazy atmospheric effect visible in the air. No new objects are revealed; the scene primarily shows the continuous forward motion of the car within the established rainy street environment relative to the static viewpoint.

The first frame displays a rainy city street at night, with a prominent dark utility pole in the left foreground, a wet asphalt road to its left, and a tiled sidewalk extending from the right foreground into the distance, featuring a green signboard on the right.

Throughout the subsequent frames, heavy rain continues to fall across the entire visible scene, and the camera subtly pans slightly to the left relative to the initial viewpoint. This gradual shift reveals more of the utility pole on the far left foreground, and a dark vehicle parked in the midground on the left side of the street becomes slightly more apparent.

In the first frame, a wet city street at night is seen from a sidewalk perspective. On the immediate left, a black pole with street signs stands next to a tall vertical advertising stand, and a white trash bag rests at its base. A wide, bright green advertising board depicting drinks is positioned on the right foreground, next to a building with illuminated windows. The wet brick sidewalk extends into the distance, lined by trees and buildings with glowing signs on the right, and parallel to a reflective asphalt road with light-colored markings on the left where distant car headlights are visible. Streetlights illuminate the scene, with traffic lights visible further down the road.

As the scene progresses, the camera pans to the left. The prominent black vertical advertising stand on the left moves progressively further left, eventually exiting the frame. A dark reddish-brown trash bag is revealed on the left sidewalk, positioned just to the right of the initial white trash bag. Subsequently, a red fire hydrant emerges into view on the left side of the sidewalk, appearing behind the original position of the advertising stand. Later, a small green bin becomes visible on the left sidewalk, situated to the right of the now more centrally located fire hydrant. This leftward pan continuously reveals more of the street, the distant road, and buildings further along the left side of the scene.
