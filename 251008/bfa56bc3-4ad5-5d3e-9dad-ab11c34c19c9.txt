The first frame shows a rainy urban street scene. In the foreground, a black metal fence runs along the left side of a wet paved sidewalk, which features a yellow tactile strip, with a partial dark pole on the far left. On the right, a lush green hedge and trees line a raised bank. In the midground, a wet multi-lane road, partially obscured by heavy rain, runs parallel to the sidewalk, with several cars and a bus with headlights on visible. A green pedestrian bridge spans the street above the road, and in the background, tall buildings rise to the left, with a blue street sign positioned above the bridge.

Over the subsequent frames, the original bus and various cars on the wet road move forward and right, traversing beneath the pedestrian bridge and closer to the viewer from their initial positions. A second, yellow bus becomes visible further down the road on the right side as the first bus progresses. The heavy rain persists throughout the scene, maintaining the wet appearance of all surfaces.
