In the first frame, a dark, ornate streetlamp post stands in the mid-foreground, slightly right of center. To its left, a white building with large dark-framed windows and a central double entrance is visible, partially obscured by the streetlamp. A yellow fire hydrant is positioned to the far left of the foreground, and a person's legs are visible near the bottom left edge, moving away. To the right of the streetlamp, a paved sidewalk extends into the distance, where a person walks away from the viewer, and other buildings and trees line the street.

The viewer's perspective subtly shifts forward and right, causing the yellow fire hydrant on the far left to move out of frame while the ornate streetlamp remains prominently in the foreground, moving slightly left relative to the frame center. The person on the right continues walking further away along the sidewalk, and more of the white building's facade and windows to the right of the main entrance become visible. Further down the street on the right, previously out of view, a white car and electric scooters are revealed.

A large, dark, ornate pillar is visible in the immediate foreground on the far left. To its right, a building features a dark entrance and a white section with a display window under a glass-roofed awning. On the paved sidewalk to the right, a person in dark clothing with a green bag walks away from the viewer, while other pedestrians are visible further down the street. A white car and a scooter are in the street to the right, with buildings lining the background under a blue sky.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the ornate pillar exits the frame to the left, revealing more of the building's facade and a '500' address number above the entrance. The person in dark clothing continues walking away from the viewer down the sidewalk. The white car in the street eventually moves out of view to the far right, and a new person enters the scene from the far left foreground, walking towards the viewer.
