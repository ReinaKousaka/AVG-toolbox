end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the initial white car approaches and then passes to the left of the viewer in the opposing lane. Subsequently, a blue SUV appears further ahead where the first car was, approaching and also passing to the viewer's left. A third white car then becomes visible in the far distance ahead, following the same road.
