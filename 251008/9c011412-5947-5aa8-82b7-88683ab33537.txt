The first frame shows a brick house at night, extensively decorated with Christmas lights. In the immediate foreground, a dark, rectangular object occupies the lower center. To the far left, a white-robed figure is partially visible, while to the right of the dark object, an illuminated elf-like figure in green and red stripes holds cymbals. Behind these, a large tree covered in red lights stands centrally, flanked on its right by a tall, green-lit lamp post structure. The house features a balcony in the upper-middle and an arched entrance with a large wreath on the far right, while the ground is covered in white string lights.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly pans to the right. This movement causes the dark foreground object and the initial partially visible white-robed figure to exit the frame to the left, revealing more of the decorated yard. A second illuminated elf-like figure, dressed in red and green, becomes fully visible to the left of the first elf, followed by an additional white illuminated reindeer figure appearing further left, all positioned in the mid-ground relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame captures a house facade and its front yard adorned with numerous Christmas lights at night. To the viewer's left, a large evergreen tree is illuminated with white lights. In the mid-ground, on the green lawn, stand three illuminated figures: an elf in a red and orange striped outfit on the far left, a reindeer glowing green in the center-left, and another elf in a green and red striped outfit holding a horn in the center-right. Behind these figures, the brick house features a balcony with ornate railings and several windows, with an "ADT" sign visible in the grass. To the viewer's right, a large bush and two tall evergreen trees are covered in red, orange, and green lights, with a large green bow-like structure on the tallest tree, and illuminated stairs ascending alongside.

The subsequent frames depict the animated illumination of the festive decorations. The lights on all the figures, trees, and bushes dynamically flicker and change in intensity, creating a sparkling effect. Specifically, the green lights on the reindeer and the large green tree structure brighten and dim, while the red and orange lights on the other trees and bushes also animate. No new objects or parts of the scene are revealed; the changes solely involve the synchronized blinking and shifting intensity of the existing Christmas lights.
