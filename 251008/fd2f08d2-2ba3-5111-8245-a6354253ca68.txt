The first frame presents a wet city street at night, with bare trees and illuminated buildings visible. A prominent tree trunk stands in the mid-left foreground, separating a reflective road on the left from a wet sidewalk on the right, which is lined with streetlights, more trees, and some parked scooters. Buildings line both sides, with a striped structure on the left and a reflective facade on the right.

As frames progress, a white vehicle moves along the wet road from the mid-left towards the background, passing the foreground tree trunk. Simultaneously, reflections on the wet ground and building facades subtly shift, indicating ongoing light changes or falling rain.

Throughout the following frames, the scene remains consistent with continuous rain creating shimmering reflections on the wet surfaces. A vehicle with red taillights briefly appears, moving from left to right across the street in the mid-ground, then disappears from view.
