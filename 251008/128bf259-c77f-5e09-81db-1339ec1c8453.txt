A dirt path stretches forward from the viewer, bordered by a grassy bank with small bushes and bare trees on the left, and a prominent green bush and an illuminated white sign on the ground to the right. The path leads into a dense backdrop of green and reddish trees beneath a grey sky, with distant hills visible above the trees.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the path that was initially in front, the white sign recedes and moves out of frame to the lower right of the original viewpoint. The trees and bushes that were initially flanking the path move closer and then recede as the viewpoint advances deeper into the woodland, with the path gradually widening and curving slightly to the right relative to the initial straight-ahead direction.
