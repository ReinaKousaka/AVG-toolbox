The first frame displays a wet city street, with two parallel yellow lines centrally extending into the distance, flanked by buildings on both sides adorned with numerous signs. To the viewer's immediate left, a person holding a black umbrella walks rightward across white crosswalk markings, with another person under a white umbrella slightly behind them, while a blue truck is visible further down the street. On the right sidewalk, two individuals stand under umbrellas adjacent to storefronts.

In the subsequent frames, the person with the black umbrella proceeds across the street from left to right, moving past the white crosswalk markings and away from the viewer's immediate left. The person with the white umbrella follows the same path, moving towards the right side of the street. The distant blue truck and the two people on the right sidewalk remain in their approximate initial positions relative to the viewer.

The first frame displays a wet, rain-slicked urban street with double yellow lines marking its center, extending towards the distant horizon where tall residential buildings are visible. Storefronts with numerous signs line both sides of the road; on the right, a utility pole with black and yellow stripes stands on the sidewalk, near a person partially visible on the far right holding a black umbrella. On the left, a blue truck and a white van are parked further down the street amidst other storefronts.

In the initial frames, the person holding the black umbrella on the far right moves out of the frame, revealing more of the storefront behind them. Subsequently, a different person emerges from the midground on the right sidewalk, walking towards the viewer while holding a white umbrella. This individual steadily progresses towards the foreground, passing the utility pole.

The first frame depicts a wet urban street, with a dark asphalt road featuring two solid yellow lines running down its center, receding into the distance from the viewer. On the left, a series of buildings housing storefronts with awnings and Korean signage line the street, with a blue truck and other vehicles parked further along. On the right, a wet sidewalk bordered by a curb features more storefronts with Korean signs, potted plants, and a person holding a white umbrella walking away from the viewer. In the mid-ground on the right, a white scooter is parked near a utility pole, and taller buildings are visible in the hazy background.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the most prominent dynamic change is the continuous forward movement of the person holding the white umbrella, who proceeds further down the street on the right sidewalk, moving away from the viewer. The rainfall continues steadily, maintaining the wet sheen on the road and causing subtle splashes, but no new objects or scenes are revealed.
