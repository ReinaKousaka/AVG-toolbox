The first frame shows a bustling beach scene. In the foreground, a man in a striped shirt stands on the far left, while a man playing a ukulele stands to his right. Several children are visible in the center and right foreground: a girl in a pink striped shirt sits in a sand pit, a girl in a blue swimsuit stands near her, and two girls are bent over or standing on the far right, near the water. The sandy beach, populated with numerous people sitting and lying, extends towards the midground where the ocean with gentle waves and more people swimming is seen on the right. In the background, palm trees line the beach, backed by tall white buildings under a cloudy sky.

In subsequent frames, the girl in the patterned swimsuit, initially bent over on the far right, straightens up and extends her arms forward before bending forward again, slightly closer to the ocean. Concurrently, the man playing the ukulele on the mid-left takes multiple steps forward, causing him to face slightly more towards the right side of the frame. The girl in the blue swimsuit in the center-right adjusts her stance and arm positions. The young boy near the ukulele player also shifts his body slightly, and the waves in the ocean continue their ebb and flow.
