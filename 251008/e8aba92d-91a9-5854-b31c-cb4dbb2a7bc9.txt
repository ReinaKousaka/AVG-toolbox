The first frame displays a city street viewed from a forward-facing perspective, flanked by tall buildings. On the left, a black minivan is parked closest to the viewer, followed by a silver SUV and a white van further down the street alongside a gray building with large windows. On the right, several black cars are parked along a brown brick building, with a blue structure visible further in the distance. The street ahead features a white painted bicycle lane symbol.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the black minivan, followed by the silver SUV and white van on the left, gradually moves out of frame to the viewer's left, revealing a yellow taxi and more of the street beyond. Simultaneously, the black cars parked on the right also move out of frame to the viewer's right. The continuous forward motion reveals new segments of the street and additional parked vehicles that were further down the road from the initial viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a city street scene looking forward, flanked by multi-story buildings. On the left, a silver SUV is parked closest to the viewer, followed by a white 'Magnolia' van and other cars, alongside a tall grey building with numerous windows. On the right, a black sedan is parked, ahead of a blue outdoor dining structure and a brown building, with trees visible along the sidewalk.
end of description
As the frames advance, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The silver SUV to the viewer's immediate left and the black sedan to the immediate right progressively move out of frame towards the rear, revealing more of the white 'Magnolia' van and the blue dining structure, respectively, as the scene ahead becomes more prominent.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a street view looking forward, with a tall building dominating the left side, featuring large windows and trees along its sidewalk. A white delivery van is partially visible at the bottom left, followed by a dark sedan and a yellow taxi, all parked on the left. On the right, another building stands, adjacent to a blue corrugated metal barrier with an orange cone in front of it, and a restaurant with a blue awning further back. The asphalt road in the center has white dashed lines and arrow markings, extending into the distance where more buildings and parked vehicles are visible under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward along the street. The white delivery van and the dark sedan previously in the foreground on the left move out of view, while the yellow taxi recedes further into the mid-ground. Pedestrians on the left sidewalk become more prominent, moving from the right to the left of the frame, and the orange cone on the right disappears.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a city street with a bright yellow minivan taxi occupying the lower-left foreground, facing away from the viewer. To its left, a sidewalk runs parallel to the street, bordered by a multi-story building featuring large glass windows and stone architectural details. Further down the street, two white vans are parked on either side of the road, with a blue corrugated metal fence visible on the far right. The street extends into the background, lined by more buildings, trees, and an overcast sky overhead.
end of description
As the frames progress, the yellow taxi moves forward and exits the frame to the left, revealing more of the sidewalk and the building's facade. A person in a light blue jacket then walks into the frame from the far left, proceeding along the newly visible sidewalk. Simultaneously, pedestrians appear in the mid-ground on the right, crossing the street behind the stationary white vans towards the left.

A white delivery van is parked on the left foreground next to a sidewalk, with a multi-story building featuring large windows beyond it. On the right foreground, a white U-Haul van is parked, partially obscuring a dark pickup truck behind it, adjacent to another sidewalk with trees. The road extends into the midground towards an intersection, bordered by various buildings, including a modern glass structure with a red heart logo on the left and older brick buildings on the right under an overcast sky.
end of description
The white delivery van on the left side of the street begins to move forward, away from the viewer, gradually revealing pedestrians walking along the adjacent sidewalk. Concurrently, the white U-Haul van on the right also pulls forward, away from the viewer, fully exposing the dark pickup truck that was previously behind it. As the left van continues its movement, red CVS banners become visible on the building's facade further to the left. Subsequently, the dark pickup truck on the right also starts to move forward, away from the viewer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a street view with a road in front of the viewer, marked with white lines. To the viewer's right, a dark green pickup truck is parked along the curb. On the left, a sidewalk features several pedestrians, a street sign, and the lower part of a light-colored building. Directly ahead and slightly to the left stands a large, modern gray building with glass sections and an "iHeart" logo, beyond which an intersection with moving vehicles and other buildings is visible under an overcast sky.

end of description

The dark green pickup truck on the viewer's right slowly drives forward, moving out of the frame. Pedestrians on the left sidewalk adjust their positions, and several people are seen crossing the intersection directly ahead, as other vehicles also proceed through it. Concurrently, the viewpoint subtly pans slightly left and zooms out, revealing more of a tall, modern building on the far left, situated behind the initial white column, and expanding the overall view of the intersection and surrounding buildings.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, an asphalt road with white crosswalk markings, including a bicycle symbol and a yellow hatched box, extends forward towards an urban intersection. To the left, a sidewalk features a blue mailbox, an orange traffic cone, and parked cars, while a large modern grey and glass building with a red heart logo dominates the mid-ground. Further along the left side and center, various multi-story brick buildings recede into the distance, with a prominent orange-brown building with fire escapes on the far right, partially hidden by a tree. Multiple pedestrians are visible on both sidewalks, and several vehicles are positioned at the intersection where green traffic lights hang under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint gradually moves forward, the blue mailbox and orange traffic cone on the left sidewalk appear slightly closer. Pedestrians on both the left and right sidewalks subtly shift their positions. A black car previously further back in the center of the intersection moves forward. Most notably, the traffic light for the cross street, visible to the left and ahead, transitions from green to yellow, then finally to red.
