In the first frame, a rustic wooden stand with a wicker basket is visible in the immediate foreground, to the viewer's left. Behind it, a red building with an open doorway reveals a blue hoodie and shelves of shoes, with a tall, black display stand holding numerous sunglasses positioned slightly further along the storefront. A paved pedestrian walkway extends into the midground, where a potted evergreen tree stands in the center and several people are walking; to the right, a large green sign reading "graf" is prominent, with a modern, circular wooden-slatted building behind it. Further right, a person is partially visible, pushing a stroller along the walkway, while beyond the building and walkway, a street with parked cars leads towards majestic snow-capped mountains under a clear blue sky in the background.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward and slightly to the right, bringing the sunglasses display stand closer to the foreground left. The person pushing the stroller on the right moves further into the frame, continuing their path alongside the viewpoint, while other pedestrians in the midground continue to walk, some moving towards the viewer and others away. Vehicles on the road beyond the green sign and circular building also change positions, with new cars becoming visible as others drive out of view relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
