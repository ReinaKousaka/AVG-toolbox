The first frame depicts a wet, multi-lane road extending forward to the left, bordered by a white guardrail and green trees. A paved pedestrian sidewalk with tactile guidance is to the right, adjacent to a line of trees and a tall wall with posters; ahead, two arched tunnels span the road under an overcast sky.

Subsequently, a white car appears on the road to the viewer's mid-left, moving forward and leaving a spray on the wet surface. It continues its path, entering the first tunnel directly ahead and eventually disappearing from view in the background.

The first frame displays a wet asphalt road on the left, bordered by a white barrier, with green trees and bushes lining it and an adjacent wet sidewalk to the right, leading towards two tunnel entrances in the distance under an overcast sky, alongside a tall grey fence on the far right.
end of description
In subsequent frames, a dark car appears on the wet road to the left, moving away from the viewer and creating a spray of water. Later, a white car appears further back on the same road, also moving away. Both cars then proceed towards and eventually disappear into the distant tunnels.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a wet paved sidewalk stretching into the background on the right, bordered by a tall gray fence on its immediate right and a strip of green bushes and trees on its left. To the left of these trees, a multi-lane wet road leads towards two tunnels recessed into a tree-covered hillside in the background, with a yellow bus parked near the far tunnel entrance.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, vehicles begin to appear and travel along the wet road, moving from the viewer's right towards the background left. A dark car is first seen moving on the road to the left of the trees, followed by another dark car and a white truck that emerge and proceed further along the road into the distance. Additionally, a "Rain Everyday" watermark appears in the bottom-left corner, slightly shifting position across frames.
