The first frame shows a paved road curving into the distance, bordered by bright green fields and wooden fence posts. A dense line of trees stands to the right, while a forested mountain slope dominates the far left, featuring a small wooden building in the mid-ground and distant snow-capped peaks under a clear blue sky, with a dark tree branch partially obscuring the upper left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road; the tree branch in the upper left of the first frame gradually moves out of view to the left. Simultaneously, the large mountain on the far left becomes more prominent, revealing an increasingly visible rocky, snow-dusted peak as the viewer advances into the scene, with the fence posts and closer trees passing by.
