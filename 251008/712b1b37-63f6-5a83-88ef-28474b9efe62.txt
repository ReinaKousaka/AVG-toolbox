In the first frame, a dark blue SUV occupies the lower-middle, facing away from the viewer on a street with a silver car partially visible to its immediate left. To the viewer's right, a stone building wall runs along a sidewalk featuring multiple black lampposts and a metal railing. On the left, a row of multi-story buildings with various colored facades and fire escapes houses shops at street level. Further down the street, trees and distant modern skyscrapers are visible, with a yellow diamond-shaped sign attached to a lamppost.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the blue SUV and the silver car in front of it begin to move forward, receding away from the viewer down the street. As they advance, more of the street ahead and the details of the buildings on the left side, previously obscured, are progressively revealed. Simultaneously, the text "MOSCO STREET" appears in the bottom left corner, remaining static relative to the viewer's perspective while the vehicles continue to move further away.

The first frame depicts a narrow city street, labeled "MOSCO STREET", viewed from a low angle looking forward. A prominent black ornate lamppost stands in the immediate foreground, slightly left of center. To the left, a silver sedan is partially visible, followed by a dark blue SUV with illuminated taillights, both facing away from the viewer. Buildings with various storefronts, awnings, and fire escapes, some featuring Chinese characters, line the left side of the street. On the right, a textured stone wall runs parallel to the viewer, with a narrow sidewalk and black metal railings along its base. In the mid-ground, another lamppost, a yellow 'yield' sign, and a 'no standing' sign are visible on the right sidewalk, with pedestrians further ahead. The street gently curves to the right in the background, revealing distant buildings, trees, and taller modern structures.
end of description
The camera slowly moves forward, causing the silver car on the left and the dark blue SUV ahead of it to also advance slightly from their initial positions. The dark blue SUV's taillights subtly brighten and dim. Concurrently, a faint red light emerges from a low-level window or opening in the stone wall on the right, gradually intensifying as the perspective shifts forward.

The first frame captures a narrow city street, "MOSCO STREET," looking down its length. To the immediate left, the front portion of a white car is visible, followed by parked black and blue SUVs lining the left side of the road, backed by historic brick buildings with green awnings and red signs. A black street lamp post stands prominently in the center-left foreground, while another lamp post further down on the right features a yellow diamond sign with a red circle, with pedestrians visible on the sidewalk behind it. The right side of the street is defined by a rough stone wall with a black handrail, showing a reddish glow from an interior space, leading towards distant trees and modern skyscrapers.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the white car on the left foreground gradually moves out of frame, and the closest black street lamp shifts to the left. The scene continues to reveal more of the architectural details and storefronts of the buildings on the left, while the stone wall on the right remains a constant feature, expanding our view further down the street. The pedestrians on the midground right sidewalk become slightly clearer as the perspective shifts, indicating a steady forward motion.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame of 'MOSCO STREET' captures a narrow street with a black street lamp post centrally in the foreground, displaying a yellow stop sign and a red 'NO STANDING' sign. To the left, a paved street contains parked and moving cars alongside buildings with Chinese signs and fire escapes, while to the right, a stone wall with a red glowing recess borders a narrow sidewalk with railings and distant pedestrians, with trees and a tall building visible at the street's end.

end of description

As the frames progress, the red glow within the recessed opening on the right stone wall subtly expands and shifts, suggesting a change in light or shadow. Concurrently, the cars further down the street exhibit minor forward movement, driving away from the first-frame viewpoint.

"MOSCO STREET" is seen from a sidewalk viewpoint, with a stone-walled building and handrail prominent on the immediate right. A central lamppost displays a red "NO STANDING" sign and a yellow diamond-shaped stop-ahead sign, while a line of parked cars extends along the left street, bordered by brick buildings featuring shops and fire escapes, with a group of people gathered on the right mid-ground sidewalk.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly shifts backward and slightly pans left over the subsequent frames. This gradually reveals more of the street and the parked black SUV on the left, while showing less of the stone building's wall to the viewer's immediate right. The lamppost and its signs become slightly smaller and shift leftward within the frame as the scene widens, and a yellow line appears on the sidewalk near the lamppost.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, the viewer looks down a narrow city street. To the immediate right, a rough stone wall building with a dark brown lower section runs parallel to the viewer, with a black metal handrail along the sidewalk edge. On the left, a brick building with fire escapes features storefronts displaying Chinese characters, and several parked cars (including a black SUV and a silver SUV) line the street further down. Centered in the mid-ground is a black lamppost adorned with a yellow diamond-shaped sign containing a red octagon; beyond it, a group of people stand on the sidewalk near a restaurant entrance with a "FRIED DUMPLING" sign. In the distance, trees with yellow foliage and taller buildings are visible.
end of description
A woman, initially positioned on the left sidewalk further down the street, walks towards the viewer, passing the lamppost. She continues advancing on the left side of the street, carrying a red bag and wearing a light-colored jacket and face mask. The other people on the right sidewalk near the restaurant entrance remain largely stationary or shift subtly in place.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a street scene with a partially visible person in a light jacket and face mask in the foreground left, carrying a red bag. A black ornate lamppost stands in the mid-ground left, bordering a street with parked cars, while red-brick buildings line the background left. On the mid-ground right, a group of people stands on the sidewalk near a stone-walled building with a green awning and a "FRIED DUMPLING" sign, with trees and a lighter building visible in the central background.
end of description
The viewpoint gradually shifts rightward, causing the person on the foreground left to move out of the frame. More of the stone-walled building's facade on the right is progressively revealed, including a white dumpling mascot logo appearing on the brown wall section that was previously less visible on the far right. The group of people remains in the mid-ground right, while the street and parked cars to the left of the lamppost become less prominent as the scene pans.
