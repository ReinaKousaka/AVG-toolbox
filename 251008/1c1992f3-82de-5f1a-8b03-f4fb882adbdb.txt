In the first frame, two individuals, a man and a woman, are seen from behind in the foreground, walking away from the viewer on a dirt path. The man wears a black t-shirt with a colorful triangle logo, and the woman, in a dark outfit, has her arm around his waist while his arm is around her shoulder. Directly ahead, spanning the path in the midground, is a large heart-shaped archway illuminated with sparkling purple lights, featuring an orange heart-shaped sign at its apex that reads 'Day 1'. Further down the path, a smaller green-lit heart archway is visible, with other people walking beneath it. To the left, a building with an orange lamp is partially visible, and to the right, trees and bushes line the path under an overcast sky.

From the first frame onwards, the couple in the foreground steadily walks forward and away from the viewer, maintaining their embrace. The primary dynamic change occurs on the orange heart-shaped sign atop the largest archway, located in the midground. Beginning around frame five, the Korean word '사랑해' (meaning 'I love you') gradually appears below 'Day 1' on the sign, becoming fully visible by frame eight, adding a romantic message to the scene.
