The first frame depicts a cobblestone pedestrian street extending into the distance under a clear sky. To the left, a blue bicycle is parked beside an O2 shop, followed by a construction site barrier covered with a green tarp and graffiti, behind which a yellow crane is visible. On the right, a "HERSCHEL" store with a glass front and an A-frame sign stands, with other commercial buildings continuing down the street. Several pedestrians are scattered along the street, mostly walking away from the viewer, with one woman in a white coat approaching from the middle-left.

In subsequent frames, the woman wearing a backpack and blue jeans, initially closest to the viewer on the right, walks further away down the street. Other pedestrians on the right also continue moving away from the viewer, while the woman in a light jacket on the left side of the path steadily approaches. Distant figures also exhibit continuous motion along the street as the scene progresses.
