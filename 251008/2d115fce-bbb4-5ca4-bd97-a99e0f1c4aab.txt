The first frame depicts a wet city street at night under heavy rain. In the immediate foreground, a pile of white plastic trash bags rests on the sidewalk to the right of a dark utility pole. To the left, the wet asphalt street reflects vibrant city lights. Buildings line both sides of the street, displaying illuminated signs on the left and less distinct structures on the right, where a solitary figure walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk. Two grey utility boxes and a small tree in a planter are visible on the right sidewalk, behind the trash bags.

As the frames progress, the pile of white trash bags in the foreground subtly grows larger, extending slightly more towards the viewer. A person carrying a red umbrella appears on the wet street to the left of the central pole, moving away from the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the individual on the far right sidewalk continues walking further into the distance. Minor shifts in the light reflections on the wet road suggest subtle, distant traffic movement through the hazy, rain-soaked scene.

The first frame depicts a rainy night street scene. In the immediate foreground to the left, a pile of white trash bags rests on the wet pavement. To the right, in the midground, two large, grey utility boxes stand beside a tree trunk. Beyond these, a glistening street reflects red and green traffic lights and vehicle headlights, with buildings displaying illuminated signs lining both sides of the background. Pedestrians with umbrellas are visible on the far-left side of the street.

Initially, the heavy rain continues with a largely static scene. A white car then emerges from the right side of the street, moving left across the frame just beyond the midground utility boxes. Concurrently, the pile of trash bags in the immediate foreground begins to visibly shift and slide towards the viewer's left, indicating water movement. A second white car appears briefly in the far distance on the right side of the street as the foreground trash bags continue to move left.

In the first frame, two large, light grey utility boxes occupy the foreground, with the smaller one to the viewer's immediate left and a taller one slightly further right; a tree trunk is partially visible behind the taller box. Beyond them, a bustling, rain-slicked city street unfolds under night lights, showing buildings, a red traffic light, and a pedestrian with an umbrella on the left, while cars move past under a green traffic light on the right.
end of description
The camera slowly pans right and slightly forward, causing the utility boxes in the foreground to gradually move out of frame to the left, while the tree trunk becomes more central. This movement progressively reveals more of the wet, reflective street and the distant buildings to the right of the initial viewpoint, as traffic lights in the background shift from red to green, and multiple vehicles continue to drive on the road.
