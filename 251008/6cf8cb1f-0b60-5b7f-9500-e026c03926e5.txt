The first frame depicts a rainy urban intersection with a wet road featuring white crosswalks in the foreground, where a person stands under a white umbrella to the left and another walks rightward behind them near a yellow-striped curb. In the midground, numerous cars navigate the intersection, while the background reveals tall city buildings, a dark-facaded structure to the right, and red traffic lights beneath an overcast sky.

Subsequently, the walking pedestrian moves further right, exiting the frame, while the standing person remains, and the initial silver and black cars in the midground continue turning right, moving away from the viewer. New vehicles, including a white SUV and a van, emerge from the left side of the first-frame viewpoint, passing the standing pedestrian and continuing rightward as the intersection traffic flows.
