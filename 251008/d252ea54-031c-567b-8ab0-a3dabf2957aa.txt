The first frame shows an asphalt road extending into the distance, marked with double yellow lines in the center and partial yellow crosswalk lines on the left. On the left, a sidewalk fronts multi-story buildings and trees, with a brown car parked further down, while a yellow pedestrian crossing sign stands in the middle of the left lane. Ahead, a white SUV and another car are visible, moving away from the viewer; on the right, a sidewalk features a low green fence, more trees, and a red hexagonal STOP sign.

As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the road. The yellow pedestrian crossing sign on the left recedes and moves towards the bottom-left edge of the frame. The white SUV and the darker car ahead of it move further into the distance. Concurrently, the buildings and trees flanking both sides of the road appear to pass by the viewer and also recede into the distance relative to the first-frame viewpoint, and the red STOP sign on the right moves slightly closer while remaining on the right side of the road.

The first frame displays a street scene with a grey asphalt road featuring double yellow lines and yellow pedestrian crossing markings in the foreground. A white SUV drives away from the viewer in the midground, with other cars visible further down the road, all flanked by multi-story buildings and numerous green-leafed trees. On the left, a portable yellow and white pedestrian crosswalk sign stands, while on the right, a red hexagonal 'STOP' sign on a green pole is positioned on the sidewalk.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the portable pedestrian crosswalk sign on the left transitions out of view, and the white SUV recedes further into the distance. The 'STOP' sign on the right, initially appearing alone, reveals an "ALL WAY" sign underneath it as it shifts closer to the right edge, while new road markings emerge in the immediate foreground.

The first frame depicts a street scene looking forward, featuring a paved road with white crosswalk lines and yellow double lines visible on the bottom left. Multi-story buildings line both sides of the street, with a distinctive striped facade on the left and a plainer building on the right, both partially obscured by numerous trees. A white SUV and several other vehicles are visible further down the road, and a red STOP sign with an "ALL WAY" plate is prominently positioned on the far right sidewalk.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective slowly advances forward along the street. The red STOP sign and its "ALL WAY" plate, initially on the far right, gradually shift further rightward and exit the frame. Simultaneously, the yellow double lines on the bottom left of the road advance subtly towards the center. Tree shadows cast upon the road surface dynamically lengthen and shorten, indicating changes in light angle or viewer movement. The white SUV and other cars ahead, though seemingly static relative to each other, appear to draw slightly closer as the viewer progresses.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a paved road with white crosswalk stripes in the foreground, extending into the midground where several cars are driving away from the viewer. To the left, a brick sidewalk borders multi-story buildings with various architectural features and parked cars, while a light pole stands near the viewer. To the right, a grassy median and more multi-story buildings with balconies and blue awnings line the street, also with parked cars. The street recedes into the distance, framed by a dense canopy of trees, under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly advances forward along the road, causing the white crosswalk stripes to move beneath the viewer, followed by a manhole cover appearing and passing below. Simultaneously, the buildings, trees, and parked cars on both sides of the street, along with the moving vehicles ahead in the distance, progressively approach and grow larger relative to the original viewpoint.
