In the first frame, the viewer is positioned at the top of a stone staircase looking down towards a wide red torii gate in the midground. To the viewer's left, a stone railing runs alongside the path, backed by dense green trees and a stone lantern. To the right, another set of stone steps ascends, adjacent to a white building adorned with a red lantern. Beyond the torii gate, a paved area with more buildings and several distant people is visible, while two masked individuals walk up the central path towards the viewer.
end of description
The two masked individuals visible in the midground of the first frame continue walking towards the viewer, progressively moving closer and passing by to the viewer's left as the sequence progresses. Their movement reveals more of the paved area and buildings beyond the torii gate, further down from the viewer's initial position.
