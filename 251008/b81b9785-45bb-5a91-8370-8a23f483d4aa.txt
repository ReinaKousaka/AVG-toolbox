The first frame presents a rainy night street scene with a wet, reflective paved path leading into the distance. In the foreground to the right, a red public notice board is partially visible, and further left, several large wooden planters containing green bushes and some pink flowers line a red sidewalk. On the left, a white electric scooter is parked on a grey sidewalk, behind which are green trees and a bus stop shelter with a red traffic light. Buildings line both sides of the path, dimly lit by streetlights under a dark sky, with visible falling rain creating a hazy atmosphere.

The camera slowly pans to the left, causing the red public notice board on the far right to gradually move out of view. This movement simultaneously reveals more of the residential buildings and a dark pole to the right of the planters, bringing a multi-story white building into fuller view on the right side of the frame. The electric scooter on the left remains mostly in place but appears less central due to the camera's shift, while the steady rain and illuminated wet surfaces continue throughout the sequence.

The first frame displays a wet, rain-slicked urban street scene at night. A reflective pathway runs through the center, bordered on the right by several wooden planters containing green and pinkish plants. To the left, a sidewalk with green bushes leads to a teal telephone booth and a bus stop shelter, beyond which distant traffic lights are visible. On the right, further buildings with illuminated windows and trees are present, all under a dark, rainy sky.

In the subsequent frames, a person holding a red umbrella appears to the left of the telephone booth and begins walking along the sidewalk towards the viewer. They steadily advance past the telephone booth and bus stop, becoming more prominent as they move closer in the heavy rain.

A nighttime street scene depicts a wet, rain-soaked sidewalk extending into the distance. To the left, a light blue telephone booth with a ladder leaning against it and a bus stop are visible, while buildings line the right, displaying illuminated windows and signage. Streetlights brightly illuminate the falling rain and create reflections on the saturated ground.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the ladder and an individual initially positioned next to the blue telephone booth on the left are progressively removed from the view. By the fifth frame, the ladder is gone, and the person becomes entirely absent in the following frames, leaving the area beside the booth clear relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The heavy rain and reflections persist throughout the entire sequence.
