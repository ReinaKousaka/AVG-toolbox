In the first frame, a paved road stretches from the bottom center into the distance, featuring a white dashed dividing line. To the viewer's left, a vibrant green field is visible, bordered by a small white road marker, while towering, tree-covered mountains rise steeply in the background. On the right, a rocky cliff face descends towards the road, alongside which are several buildings: a cream-colored house with a red-tiled roof is partially visible in the immediate foreground, followed by a white, multi-story house further along the road. High in the background, a bright blue sky with white clouds is visible, and a small white car can be seen driving in the distance on the road.

As the viewpoint progresses along the road, the initial foreground house on the right moves out of frame, revealing more of the white, multi-story house with dark window shutters further ahead on the right. Additional sections of the rocky cliff and a concrete retaining wall on the right become more prominent, while another white building with balconies and a fence appears on the right, further down the road relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Subsequently, a red car becomes visible parked alongside the white house on the right, indicating continuous movement past the roadside structures.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a paved road curving left into a mountainous valley under a blue sky, with a grassy field on the left, two houses (one beige, one white) on the right foreground, a distant white car on the road ahead, and a red car parked on the right shoulder.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the houses on the right recede and exit the frame to the right, revealing more of the steep, tree-covered mountain face previously behind them. The parked red car on the right is approached and then passed, while the distant white car on the road ahead remains visible, slowly coming closer. Further along the road, a blue rectangular sign appears on the left, and a yellow diamond-shaped sign emerges on the right where the houses once stood.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a paved road curving gently to the left and extending into the distance, marked by a solid white center line. A red car is parked on the right shoulder, facing away from the viewer, with a steep, vegetated hillside rising immediately to its right, featuring a '50' speed limit sign and a yellow diamond sign on poles. To the left of the road lies a grassy field, beyond which a blue directional sign is visible, along with a distant tall bridge structure. A white car appears on the road far ahead in the left lane, and the scene is set under a blue sky with scattered clouds, framed by distant mountains.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward along the road. The red car parked on the right shoulder and the initial traffic signs on the right disappear from view, having been passed to the immediate right of the first-frame viewpoint. New yellow bicycle lane markings progressively appear on both shoulders of the road, becoming visible directly ahead of the first-frame viewpoint on the road surface. Meanwhile, the blue road sign and a black and white marker pole, originally on the left side, continue to approach and eventually pass to the left of the first-frame viewpoint. The distant white car also steadily moves closer on the road ahead, still to the left of the viewer's lane, as the road itself curves further to the left.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a paved road, featuring a solid white center line and dashed yellow lines on either side, leading forward and curving gently to the left in the distance. To the left, a flat green grassy area extends towards a dark, steep mountain face where a large, multi-arched bridge structure (viaduct) ascends, with further mountains visible beyond. To the right, a concrete retaining wall immediately borders the road, topped with green grass and lush trees covering a steep hillside. A small white car is visible far ahead on the road, beneath a blue sky dotted with white clouds.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The white car ahead gradually approaches, becoming larger and clearer relative to the viewer's position. The concrete retaining wall and the treed hillside on the right side of the road steadily move closer and pass by the viewer's immediate right. Concurrently, the grassy field and the distant bridge structure on the left side also draw nearer, illustrating the continuous forward travel through the mountainous landscape.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a paved road extending away from the viewer into a mountainous valley under a clear blue sky with white clouds. A white dividing line and dashed yellow lines are visible on the road in the foreground, with a small white marker post to the far left. To the left, a grassy verge leads to a dark, steep mountain face adorned with a multi-level bridge or viaduct, while to the right, a vegetated embankment rises, topped by lush trees. A small white car is distantly visible on the road, heading towards an apparent tunnel entrance nestled between further mountains in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The white car in the distance appears to recede further, becoming smaller. The road markings and immediate grassy verges on both sides move towards and past the viewer, revealing more of the concrete retaining wall on the right embankment, which grows in detail and proximity. The imposing bridge on the left mountain face also draws closer, revealing more of its structural elements as the scene unfolds.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The viewer is on a paved road extending into a mountainous valley under a blue sky with white clouds. To the left, a steep, tree-covered mountain features a large concrete viaduct with multiple pillars curving away, with green grass between the road and mountain. To the right, a rocky concrete retaining wall borders the road, ascending to a tree-covered slope, with more green grass at its base. A white car is visible ahead on the road.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward, causing the white car to approach and objects on the road's edges to move closer before receding. A yellow bicycle symbol and a red-and-white sign become visible on the right shoulder, progressively closer to the viewer. The large concrete structure on the right reveals itself as a tunnel entrance or avalanche barrier, while the viaduct on the left shows more of its intricate support structure, and an electricity pylon becomes visible adjacent to it.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a paved road stretching into a mountain valley under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. To the viewer's right, a grassy verge borders a large, angled concrete structure, with a road sign pole bearing two triangular warning signs positioned closer to the viewer. On the left, beyond a grassy verge and metal fence, a multi-arched concrete viaduct ascends the steep, forested mountainside, above a smaller, angled concrete building. A distant white car is visible on the road, centered in the valley between the towering, tree-covered slopes.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The road signs on the right approach the viewer and move out of view to the right, behind the viewer's initial right position. The painted road markings change; the dashed white line on the left transitions to solid lines and then a cross-hatch pattern, while the thin yellow line on the right also widens into a double yellow, eventually becoming part of a cross-hatch area. The white car in the distance remains visible, moving slightly further ahead within the valley.
