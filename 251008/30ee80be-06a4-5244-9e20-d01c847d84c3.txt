The first frame prominently displays a large cluster of clear balloons with yellow and black designs and several colorful light-up sticks in the foreground, slightly right of center, partially obscuring a woman in a light coat on the bottom-left. In the midground, a large, bare-branched tree stands on the left, with numerous people scattered across the scene and a "ROAD CLOSED" sign to the right. The background is dominated by a row of multi-story, ornate buildings on the right, all under an overcast sky.

In subsequent frames, the crowd of people in the midground and foreground continuously moves, and the woman in the bottom-left gradually exits the frame. The cluster of balloons and sticks in the foreground gently sways, while a man near them to the right bends down to interact with the display. Concurrently, white smoke or steam intermittently emerges and dissipates from behind the balloon display, originating near the large tree in the midground-left.
