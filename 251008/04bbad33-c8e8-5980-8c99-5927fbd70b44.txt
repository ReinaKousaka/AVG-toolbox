The first frame depicts a serene Chinese garden courtyard with a textured brick path curving through the foreground, leading towards a white plastered wall with a dark gray base in the midground. To the left, a dark red doorway is open, revealing another garden section beyond with trees and foliage. A tree with golden autumn leaves stands near the open doorway, while a smaller reddish-purple leafed tree is positioned to the far right, partially obscuring the wall. Centered along the wall are a circular lattice window and three trees with green foliage and white-painted lower trunks, flanked by two large stone slabs at their base. Various green shrubs and ground cover plants adorn the right side of the path and along the wall.

The first frame presents a serene garden courtyard with a grey brick-paved path occupying the foreground, bordered by green foliage patches on the left and right. A white wall with a dark grey base spans the mid-ground, featuring an open dark reddish-brown gate on the far left revealing distant foliage, a central rectangular window with a lattice pattern, and two arched niches below it. In front of the wall are several trees with white-painted bases, including a large tree on the left, three green-leafed trees in the center, a sculpted evergreen to the right, and a red-leafed tree further right. Two upright grey stones sit in front of the central niches, while green shrubbery lines the wall's base and a canopy of trees with yellow and green foliage is visible above the wall.
