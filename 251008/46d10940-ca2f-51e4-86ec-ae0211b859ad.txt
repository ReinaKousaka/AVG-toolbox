In the first frame, a person in dark clothing walks away from the viewer on a paved path towards the left. To the right, a low stone wall borders a dirt area with scattered autumn leaves, where several small lights and multiple easels with canvases are visible. A traditional Korean-style building with a green tiled roof stands to the far left, while a large tree with autumn foliage and a prominent gnarled tree stump are positioned further right of the path. Overhead, branches with red-brown leaves frame the top of the scene against a light orange to blue sky.

Subsequently, the person continues walking further away along the path, progressively receding from the viewer. The overall scene subtly brightens, enhancing the visibility of the easels to the right of the path and the autumn leaves in the trees. The sky also appears to brighten slightly, suggesting a gradual passage of time or an increase in ambient light, with no new objects fully revealed from the first-frame viewpoint.
