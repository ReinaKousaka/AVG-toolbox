The first frame shows a multi-lane city street looking forward, with a white SUV and other cars parked to the immediate left, alongside a sidewalk lined with buildings and trees. A blue directional sign is positioned above the parked cars on the left, while a prominent skyscraper stands in the mid-ground slightly to the right, with more buildings and tram tracks extending along the right side of the road. end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the blue street sign on the left to rise and exit the top of the frame. The parked white SUV to the left becomes relatively smaller and eventually moves further left and slightly behind the original first-frame viewpoint. More of the street and buildings ahead are revealed, with the distant skyscraper maintaining its general position relative to the overall landscape as the viewer approaches.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a city street from a vehicle's perspective, with a white minivan positioned immediately to the left and a black minivan slightly ahead, both parked alongside a sidewalk lined with commercial buildings and trees. To the right, tram tracks run parallel to the road, bordered by tall buildings, including a prominent skyscraper in the mid-right, while the road recedes into the distance under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description.
The white minivan then moves forward and further to the left of the viewer's initial position, revealing a pedestrian crossing directly in front. Subsequently, the black minivan also advances, and a green traffic light becomes clearly visible further down the road, straight ahead from the original viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a city street from a forward-facing perspective, featuring a pedestrian crosswalk directly in front, a partially visible dark green car and parked black SUV to the immediate left, and a large grey building extending along that side. On the right, a tall skyscraper and other buildings line the street, with tram tracks on the far right, and a black car positioned further down the central road beyond the crosswalk.
end of description
Subsequently, the dark green car and the black SUV, initially on the viewer's immediate front-left, move forward and away from the first-frame viewpoint, while the black car further down the central road also advances. Pedestrians and a cyclist become visible on the left sidewalk, emerging from behind the initial position of the green car and moving towards then past the first-frame viewpoint. The crosswalk lines in the foreground progressively recede from the bottom of the frame as the viewer's vehicle moves forward.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a city street from a car's perspective, with a pedestrian crosswalk and the vehicle's dashboard in the foreground. Centered ahead, a black SUV drives down the road, with additional vehicles visible further in the distance. To the left are a sidewalk lined with trees, a traffic light pole with green signals, and multi-story buildings, while to the right, taller buildings stand alongside tram tracks.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the black SUV ahead continues down the street, and the crosswalk recedes beneath the viewpoint. The traffic light pole and early street elements move out of view to the left as new vehicles appear further ahead in the lane. Buildings on both sides become more distinct, with a large 'P' logo emerging on the right-side building, revealing more of the urban environment.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a multi-lane city street from a driver's viewpoint, with a black SUV directly ahead and a queue of cars extending into the distant right, where tall buildings are visible including one with an orange 'P' logo. To the viewer's left, a tree-lined sidewalk runs alongside a building, with a street sign positioned centrally.
end of description
Over the subsequent frames, the line of traffic on the right slowly advances, causing the black SUV directly in front to move forward and eventually out of frame, revealing more of the white sedan behind it. As the viewer's perspective also slowly progresses, new vehicles appear in the advancing queue on the right, and the buildings and sidewalk on the left gradually shift further left and slightly upwards relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a city street from a low, forward-looking perspective, likely from a vehicle. A multi-lane road extends ahead, with stationary traffic on the right alongside tall buildings, including one with an orange 'P' logo. To the left, a sidewalk with metal barriers runs parallel to a large building, with trees and a utility pole displaying a blue sign further down the street.
end of description
As the viewer's vehicle advances slowly, cars in the right lane move forward, sequentially revealing a white sedan, then a black car, while a bus becomes more visible in the distant right lane. On the left, the sidewalk, buildings, and trees shift right to left in the frame, exposing new sections of the street and revealing a cyclist moving forward on the left sidewalk.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
From a vehicle's perspective, a multi-lane city street stretches forward, lined by buildings under an overcast sky. On the immediate left, a tree stands beside a sidewalk where a cyclist rides, with a brown multi-story building and bus shelters behind. To the right, tall glass skyscrapers rise, with a black car partially visible in the foreground, and other cars (silver van, dark red compact) further ahead on the road.
end of description
As the frames advance, the viewer's vehicle moves slowly forward. The black car on the right moves ahead, as do the silver van and dark red compact car further down the road. Simultaneously, the bicyclist on the left proceeds forward along the sidewalk.
