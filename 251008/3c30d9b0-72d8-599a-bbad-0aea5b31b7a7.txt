In the first frame, two people walk away from the viewer on a sunlit city sidewalk. A woman with blonde hair and sunglasses, wearing a white tank top and shorts, is slightly to the left of center, holding a phone and carrying small Canadian flags on her hip. To her right, a man with a beard, sunglasses, a white cap, and a white t-shirt walks beside her. To the viewer's left is a building with an "Academy" sign and images, featuring a covered walkway and steps leading into the building. Further down the sidewalk, another person in dark clothing is visible. To the far right, a tree trunk partially obscures a tall building, while a street with parked and moving cars stretches into the background, flanked by other urban structures.
end of description
As the frames progress, both the woman and the man walk further away from the viewer, eventually exiting the right side of the frame by the fourth and fifth frames, respectively. The person in dark clothing further down the sidewalk also recedes. With the foreground clearing, the street and more buildings in the background become increasingly visible directly ahead and to the right of the central vanishing point.
