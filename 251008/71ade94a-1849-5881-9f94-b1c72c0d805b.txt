The first frame depicts a paved road stretching into the distance, centered in the lower part of the view, with a female runner, viewed from behind, in the mid-ground. Lush green grassy verges flank both sides of the road, with a steep, densely treed bank rising on the left and a gentler, tree-lined slope descending on the right, where a small house with a dark roof is visible further down. The background reveals rolling hills covered in trees beneath a blue sky dotted with white clouds, while a digital distance marker is on the far left and running metrics are displayed on the bottom right.

Across the subsequent frames, the runner continues moving forward along the road, progressively appearing further into the scene and away from the first-frame viewpoint. The surrounding landscape, including the trees, grassy banks, and the house on the right, remains spatially consistent relative to the initial frame's perspective, with only subtle shifts as the viewpoint advances. The overlaid running metrics on the bottom right also update chronologically.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a paved road extending forward from the viewer, flanked by green grassy verges. A person wearing black running attire is visible on the road in the midground, moving away from the viewer. To the viewer's left, a steep hillside covered in dense green trees rises. To the viewer's right, beyond a grassy slope, a small light-colored house with a dark roof is nestled among trees, with a partial bridge structure visible further behind it; more tree-covered hills recede into the distance on both sides. The sky above is blue with scattered white clouds. Overlay graphics are present on the left showing distance metrics (e.g., "7.9 km") and on the right displaying running statistics (e.g., "04:44/km", "13 km/h") and "Swiss Running TV".

In the subsequent frames, the runner continues to move further along the road, receding slightly from the first-frame viewpoint. The surrounding landscape, including the house and trees to the right and the wooded hillside to the left, remains largely static relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The overlay metrics on the right consistently update, showing a decrease in pace and an increase in total time (e.g., "04:33/km", "00:40:03").
