In the first frame, a paved path extends from the bottom center, curving slightly left into the distance. To its left, a low stone wall supports a steep, grassy hillside topped by trees and a metal fence, all positioned to the viewer's left. A row of houses with reddish-brown roofs and varied facades (including a prominent light blue one) lines the right side of the path, receding towards the right midground, with a cityscape and distant mountains visible in the far background under a cloudy sky. An overlay in the top right displays 'speed 5 KM/H', 'grade -22%', and 'distance 9.3 KM'.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the path, the speed gradually increases from 5 to 7 KM/H, and the grade changes slightly from -22% to -23%. Objects previously in the midground, such as the houses on the right, appear closer and shift slightly left within the frame. A red flag, likely Norwegian, is progressively revealed to the right of the path, positioned behind the second house from the foreground. The steep, grassy hillside on the left also unveils more of its upper section and trees as the viewer descends.

The viewer is positioned on a descending, narrow paved street, with a steep hill densely covered in green foliage and reddish-brown shrubs to the immediate left. On the right, a blue house with a prominent red tiled roof and a chimney is closest, followed by several white traditional houses receding down the street. A dark grey lamppost stands vertically in the mid-left, and a data overlay indicating speed, grade, and distance is visible in the top right corner against a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street, causing the lamppost to shift leftward out of the frame and revealing more of the street ahead. A green electric scooter appears on the left side of the street, and a new light grey house with a balcony becomes visible further up the hillside on the left, behind the initial foliage, with a black car appearing further down the road.

The first frame shows a narrow, sloping street with a scooter handlebar visible at the bottom center. To the left, a steep, green hillside topped by a light gray building with a red roof and balcony rises. To the right, a dark blue wooden house and a row of white houses with red roofs line the street, one featuring a blue recycling bin in front. A black car is parked further down the asphalt road, which extends towards more distant buildings under a cloudy sky, while an information overlay is visible in the top right.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the immediate foreground scooter handlebar moves out of view. The grassy hillside on the left recedes, progressively revealing a stone retaining wall beneath the vegetation, which was previously unseen. Simultaneously, the dark blue house and the subsequent white houses on the right appear to move past the viewer, with the blue recycling bin becoming more prominent before moving out of the frame behind the viewer. The black car that was initially further down the street steadily approaches, getting closer to the viewer's current position. Concurrently, the data overlay updates to show an increase in speed and a decrease in the negative grade as the descent continues.
