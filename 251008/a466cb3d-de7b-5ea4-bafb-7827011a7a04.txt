The first frame displays a wet street marked with yellow lines and a '30' speed limit circle in the foreground, stretching into the background. To the far left, a person holding a blue umbrella walks away on the sidewalk, alongside a lush, treed embankment. A silver car and a white car are parked on the left side of the road in the midground, while brick buildings with signs and a red-and-white striped awning, under which a blue hand truck and other items are visible, line the right side.

In the subsequent frames, the person with the blue umbrella on the far left moves out of view, disappearing from the scene. The silver and white cars on the left side of the road remain stationary. No other dynamic changes or newly revealed objects are observed; the street, buildings, and general environment remain consistent.

The first frame displays a wet street scene under an overcast sky, looking forward into a town. In the foreground, a glistening asphalt road with a white arrow and yellow double lines occupies the left and center, while on the right, a red and white striped umbrella partially shelters goods piled on a sidewalk next to a brick building with Korean signage. To the left, a green, tree-covered hillside ascends, with a white car parked further down the road. In the mid-ground, the road continues, flanked by more brick buildings on the right and utility poles with overhead wires running across the view, with another light-colored car visible further down. Distant high-rise buildings are faintly visible against the horizon in the background.

In the subsequent frames, numerous raindrops are consistently visible striking the wet asphalt road, creating small, transient splashes and ripples across its surface, particularly prominent in the mid-ground. Raindrops are also periodically visible hitting the surface of the red and white striped umbrella on the right. All other visible objects, including the cars, buildings, and trees, remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a wet, asphalt street under an overcast sky. To the left, a stone wall supports green trees, behind which a white RV and another white car are parked further down, with a silver car positioned closer to the viewer on the street. On the right, a red and white striped market umbrella with items beneath it stands in front of a brick building adorned with various signs. Utility poles and overhead wires crisscross the midground, with distant buildings visible in the background.
end of description
The red and white market umbrella on the right disappears, and a blue and yellow striped umbrella briefly appears slightly behind its original position before also vanishing. The items previously under the umbrella are replaced by a dark blue tarp, which subsequently disappears, gradually revealing more of the storefront on the right. Finally, white boxes briefly appear on the right sidewalk before they too are gone.
