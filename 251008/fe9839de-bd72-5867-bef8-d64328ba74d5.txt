The first frame depicts a wet, outdoor public space filled with people under an overcast sky. In the foreground, a woman in traditional light attire stands center-right; to her immediate left and slightly closer to the viewer, another woman holds a phone, and further left, a man also holds a phone up. Green trees line the midground, with a building adorned with orange lanterns visible on the far right.

The woman in traditional attire then gradually walks from her initial center-right position towards the viewer's left, becoming a prominent figure in the left foreground as the other two foreground subjects move further left and out of frame, revealing more of the background crowd and the public space previously behind them.
