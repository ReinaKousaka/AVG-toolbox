The first frame depicts a bedroom seen through a partially open white doorway, revealing a centered bed with white bedding and a green bench, a wooden nightstand and lamp to its left, and striped wallpaper on the sloped ceiling and walls.

As the camera moves forward into the room, the doorway widens, progressively revealing more of the bedroom. A chandelier descends above the bed, now clearly visible deeper within the room. To the right of the bed, a second nightstand with a lamp and another window with striped curtains appear, previously obscured by the door from the first-frame viewpoint. Finally, a plaid armchair emerges in the far right corner, expanding the complete room view.
