The first frame shows a blue and white bus partially visible on the lower-left street, moving alongside a median with green shrubs. Across the street, cars, motorbikes, and a red crane arm are seen amidst trees, while to the right, a paved sidewalk extends forward with a green trash bin and a line of palm trees, next to a large white pillar.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the sidewalk, the blue bus on the left moves forward and exits the frame, while the green trash bin and white pillar on the right pass by and move behind the observer's initial field of view. Concurrently, new segments of the sidewalk, median, and road ahead of the first frame's initial view are revealed.

The first frame depicts a street scene viewed from a sidewalk, looking forward. To the left, a multi-lane road is visible with several vehicles, including a prominent silver SUV in the mid-ground, and buildings beyond a line of tall, leafy green trees. In the center, a paved sidewalk extends into the distance, separated from the road by a low planter filled with green shrubs. To the right, another planter with green foliage borders a large white cylindrical column, behind which a row of palm trees stretches into the background. Two green garbage bins sit on the right side of the sidewalk, slightly forward and to the right of the viewer's immediate position.
end of description
Subsequent frames show dynamic movement on the left side of the street. A dark car, initially positioned behind the silver SUV, gradually moves forward, revealing more of a red crane arm behind it. A scooter then appears from the far left of the frame, entering the road behind the dark car. This scooter proceeds to overtake the dark car and the SUV, moving further into the scene before continuing forward out of the immediate foreground, as a white truck becomes more visible behind the crane.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
From a paved sidewalk, the viewer observes a tree-lined street extending into the background on the left, with parked cars and multi-story buildings alongside. Immediately to the right are two green garbage bins on wheels and a large white pillar with a blue '4', while a row of palm trees and a building are visible further right.

end of description

As the viewpoint progresses forward, the green bins and white pillar move out of frame to the right. A yellow bridge structure progressively emerges in the far right background, behind the palm trees and building, while a cement mixer truck becomes visible further down the street on the left. The general perspective shifts, bringing previously distant details of the urban environment closer to the viewer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows the viewer standing on a paved walkway, looking forward down a tree-lined street. To the immediate right in the foreground are two large green garbage bins. Beyond them, a landscaped area with low, wavy green bushes and a line of tall palm trees extends into the mid-ground, revealing a river, a white building, and a distant yellow bridge (likely the Dragon Bridge) on the far right. To the left, a long, raised planter with trimmed green bushes separates the walkway from a street where several parked cars, including a prominent white SUV, are visible in the mid-ground. Further down the street on the left, numerous leafy trees line the road, with buildings and a red and white concrete mixer truck visible in the background.
end of description
The camera subtly moves forward along the paved walkway. This slight progression causes the two green garbage bins in the foreground right to gradually shift out of view to the right. Concurrently, the initial portion of the bush-lined planter on the left also moves slightly out of frame to the left as the viewpoint advances. No significant new objects or scenes are revealed, and the parked cars, trees, and distant river and bridge remain consistently within the frame, showing no independent movement.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
A paved pedestrian path extends into the distance, bordered by green hedges in planters. To the left, a street bustles with vehicles and a red boom crane, backed by trees and buildings, while to the right, a row of palm trees leads to white buildings and a yellow bridge visible over a distant river.
end of description
As the viewpoint steadily advances along the path, the initial foreground elements, including a green trash bin on the right, progressively recede. On the left, vehicles move and new ones become visible as the red boom crane also recedes into the background. The continuous progression reveals more of the path ahead, maintaining the vista of palm trees and the distant river on the right.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A paved pedestrian pathway extends directly forward from the viewer, bordered on the left by a low planter with green bushes and orange flowers, and on the right by a curvilinear grassy area and more bushes. To the left of the path, a street features a white cement mixer truck with a red boom, other vehicles, and a line of tall deciduous trees. To the right, a row of palm trees stands before a multi-story building and a body of water with a distinct yellow bridge in the distant background.
end of description
A dark scooter with a rider emerges from the far left of the first-frame viewpoint, moving forward along the street. Concurrently, a red car appears behind the scooter on the left, also advancing slowly. The overall scene subtly shifts, suggesting a very slow forward progression of the viewer along the pathway.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a paved walkway extending directly forward from the viewer, bordered by raised planters with green foliage on both sides. To the immediate left, beyond a planter with shrubs and scattered orange flowers, lies a road featuring a white cement mixer truck, various cars, and motorcycles, backed by a line of trees and urban buildings. To the right, an undulating grassy planter leads to a prominent row of tall palm trees, behind which a white multi-story building and a distant yellow bridge are visible against a bright sky.
end of description
As the camera continuously moves forward along the walkway, the vehicles on the left road, including the cement mixer, gradually recede further into the distance relative to the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, a large red crane arm becomes more prominent on the left side of the road, appearing behind the area where the cement mixer was first seen, as the viewer progresses.
