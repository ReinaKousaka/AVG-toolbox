The first frame displays a paved courtyard in the foreground, leading towards a street on the far left, flanked by brick buildings; to the viewer's right is a building with a red awning and a bench, while a central brick structure with wooden doors, AC units, and a leaning wooden trellis stands ahead, with a two-story brick building further left along the street.
end of description
In later frames, a red fire extinguisher appears on the right building's wall, to the right of the trellis, and a red bucket-like object emerges on the ground to the left, near the street. Subsequently, a person in a light shirt enters the left side of the courtyard, repeatedly bending down and standing up while interacting with and holding the red bucket.

The first frame reveals a paved alleyway stretching into the distance, flanked by brick buildings. To the left, a two-story building features red awnings and an open doorway displaying a shop interior with merchandise and a sign reading "马应龙." To the right, a single-story brick building has large wooden double doors and an air conditioning unit above, with a stack of wooden crates to its far right. In the midground, several pedestrians walk away from the viewer, while a person bends over to sweep the pavement with a red dustpan and broom, positioned to the right of two black and yellow striped cones in the foreground.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the person in the midground actively sweeps debris into the red dustpan, steadily rising to an upright position and turning slightly to their left. Simultaneously, the stack of wooden crates to the far right of the single-story building shifts subtly, and a blue object emerges near its base.

The first frame shows a paved street bordered by brick buildings under an overcast sky, with green trees in the background; a shop with open wooden doors and a visible person is on the left, while on the right, a person sweeps near red crates and an ornate wooden door.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the person sweeping on the right side of the street moves slightly forward and to the left. Simultaneously, additional white and red display panels, some circular, are progressively revealed and affixed to the brick wall on the right, extending horizontally towards the viewer's right edge. The two people walking in the mid-ground continue to move further away from the viewer.

The first frame captures a bustling street scene lined with buildings featuring grey brick facades and red accents, leading towards a background of lush green trees and hills. In the midground, a person mops the pavement with a red bucket beside them, slightly right of center. To the left, an open shop entrance reveals hanging items and a wall-mounted map, while opposite on the right, a shopfront displays circular mirrors and stacked red crates. Two other individuals stand further down the street on the left, near some potted plants.
end of description
Over the subsequent frames, the mopping person dynamically moves progressively to their right, continuing to clean the pavement while bending significantly closer to the ground and sweeping towards the red crates on the right wall. Concurrently, the individual at the left shop entrance subtly shifts their position and looks downward.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a paved alleyway lined with buildings, leading towards a distant tree-covered hillside under an overcast sky. In the immediate foreground to the right, a person is bent over, actively sweeping the ground. On the left, a light-colored brick building features a red awning and a large map display board, in front of which two women are standing. Opposite, on the right, a red-fronted shop with prominent Chinese signage displays various posters and merchandise, with a pink vendor cart positioned near it. Further down the alley, central to the view, several decorative white elements, possibly geese statues, are arranged on the pavement.
end of description
Throughout the frames, the person sweeping in the foreground, initially bent low to the right, gradually straightens up, eventually standing mostly upright by the last frame. Simultaneously, a person in dark clothing, initially standing near the pink vendor cart further down the alley on the right, slowly walks towards the viewer's left and deeper into the scene. The two women on the left remain largely stationary throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a street scene is depicted with brick buildings lining both sides. To the viewer's left, a building features a large white signboard displaying a map and text, with two women standing near it, looking at the sign. To the viewer's right, another brick building has a red awning and a shop entrance, with a pastel pink and white booth-like structure and a QR code sign attached to the wall. A person in a black shirt and white visor walks away from the viewer in the midground, where a large gray planter with a green plant is centrally positioned, and numerous white statues line the path further back. The background features lush green trees covering a hillside, with a small red-roofed building visible among them.
end of description
The two women on the left near the signboard shift positions, with one raising her arm to point towards the top of the sign. The second woman turns her head to follow the pointing gesture, looking at the signboard as well. Concurrently, the person in the black shirt and white visor continues walking further away from the viewer along the path in the midground, heading towards the treed background. No new objects or scenes are revealed; only the existing figures move within the established environment.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a street scene with buildings flanking both sides and a treelined park in the background. To the immediate left, a building with a dark awning partially obscures two individuals looking at its wall. On the right, a brick building features a red awning and a pink kiosk; a person in a black shirt and visor walks towards the viewer on the sidewalk. A paved road stretches through the center, with a grey planter containing green foliage in the foreground. A row of bollards separates the road from a lush, treelined area in the mid-background, which includes a small building with a red roof, and several parked scooters. A red car is visible further down the road to the left.
end of description
The person in the black shirt and visor in the foreground right steadily walks closer to the viewer, eventually moving out of the frame to the immediate right. Concurrently, a red car approaches from the mid-left distance along the road, passes the foreground left, and continues past the viewer. Following the red car, a person in white emerges from the mid-left distance and walks along the road towards the viewer. The two individuals initially on the far left, looking at the building, subtly shift positions and then move out of view to the far left.
