In the first frame, a night street scene is depicted with a utility pole and two circular red no-parking signs prominently positioned in the center-right foreground. To the pole's immediate left is a grey electrical box, with black metal railings extending towards the viewer's left along a paved sidewalk. Further left on the sidewalk, a streetlamp illuminates a bus stop sign, and a dark SUV is parked on the road beyond it, facing away. On the right, buildings line the street, one featuring a distinctive yellow-striped awning.

The viewpoint steadily pans to the right, causing the utility pole and signs, along with the electrical box and railings, to gradually exit the frame to the viewer's right. As the camera moves, more of the sidewalk and green bushes directly to the viewer's left become visible. Simultaneously, a pedestrian in yellow attire emerges walking on the far side of the street, moving from the mid-left of the original scene towards the viewer's left. The buildings on the opposite side of the street, initially mid-right, also shift leftward in the frame.

end of description
As the viewer progresses, the bus stop sign shifts off-screen to the right, simultaneously revealing a red vending machine and a yellow bicycle appearing along the sidewalk to the left of the original viewpoint. The white car continues its movement away on the street, eventually disappearing off-frame to the far right.
