In the first frame, a two-story, light-tan stucco house with a reddish-brown tiled roof occupies the center, angled slightly to the right of the viewer. In the lower left foreground, a light-colored block wall or railing is visible. The house features multiple dark-framed windows, some with decorative wrought-iron railings below them, and an arched entryway on the lower right, flanked by a wall light. To the far left and behind the house, green foliage is visible, while green bushes are in front of the lower left windows. Potted cacti rest on a partial wall in the lower right foreground.
end of description
The camera slowly pans right, progressively revealing more of the house's right side and the surrounding area. An outdoor staircase with light steps and a dark railing becomes visible to the right of the arched entryway, ascending towards a distant green hill in the background. Concurrently, the upper balcony doors gradually open wider. As the view continues to shift right, a dark lounge chair and a section of a blue swimming pool emerge in the mid-ground, further revealing more potted cacti and lush green vegetation on the hillside to the far right.
