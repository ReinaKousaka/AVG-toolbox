The first frame shows an uphill paved road curving right, with a sidewalk and metal railing adorned with flower boxes to the left. On the right, a multi-story brown wooden building is set into a grassy hillside supported by a stone wall, while tall green trees densely border the left and distant mountains loom under a clear blue sky.

As the camera progresses along the road, the two previously visible cyclists on the left are passed, and the flagpole's banner becomes clearer, revealing yellow and white graphics. Simultaneously, the brown building on the right grows larger, exposing a newly visible garage-like entrance beneath it and more detail of the surrounding stone wall and flora.
