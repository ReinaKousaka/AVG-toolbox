The first frame presents a lantern-lined wooden pathway extending from the lower left towards the mid-distance. To the right, a wooden railing features illuminated art panels, while beyond it, a wide river stretches towards a distant cityscape under a dusky sky. On the left, multi-story buildings with traditional architecture rise, and several red and yellow lanterns hang diagonally overhead, illuminating the path where a few people walk in the midground.

The viewpoint consistently moves forward along the path, progressively revealing more of the railing's art panels, lanterns, and buildings extending further ahead from the initial position. The small group of people also steadily progresses deeper into the scene along the path, moving away from the viewer's original position.

In the first frame, a wooden walkway extends into the distance, bordered by rough stone walls and multi-storied buildings on the left, and a wooden railing with illuminated picture frames on the right, overlooking a wide river. Overhead, a lamppost supports strings of red and orange lanterns, with a distant cityscape silhouetted against the twilight sky across the water.

As the scene progresses, foreground objects on the left, like the trash bin and stone wall, appear to grow larger and move past the viewer's original position, revealing more steps leading to the buildings. Simultaneously, the railing with its glowing frames on the right approaches and extends past the viewer's initial position, while the hanging lanterns shift their arrangement across the frame. The lamppost initially seen top-left moves out of view to the left, and a distinct black lantern, initially partially obscured, becomes fully visible hanging centrally above the railing.

The first frame presents a twilight view of a bustling pathway, with traditional buildings and steps on the left side, and a river to the right, bordered by a wooden railing adorned with illuminated art panels. A string of red and orange lanterns hangs overhead, leading the eye towards a distant city skyline across the water. Several people are visible walking along the pathway in the midground, moving away from the viewer.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly pans to the right, revealing more of the river and the distant cityscape further to the right of the initial scene. Concurrently, new illuminated art panels become visible along the railing as the camera shifts, and the group of people continues to move further down the pathway away from the viewer.

The first frame displays a twilight scene along a river walkway, with an ascending staircase and part of a building featuring red pillars and stone walls positioned to the viewer's immediate left. A narrow path extends into the distance, populated by a few people, while a wooden railing with illuminated display panels lines its right edge, overlooking a wide river. Across the river in the background, a distant cityscape with numerous buildings rises under a darkening sky, and a line of glowing red and orange lanterns hangs above the path and river, stretching from the midground into the background.

Subsequently, the viewpoint slowly pans rightward, gradually revealing more of the red and orange lanterns previously on the right side of the frame and bringing additional lanterns with discernible Chinese characters into clearer view as they move further into the frame from the right. The individuals on the walkway remain relatively stationary, and the river, cityscape, and buildings remain consistently positioned in the background relative to the overall scene.
