frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a narrow, cobbled street with tall buildings on both sides. A man in a maroon apron and holding a white bag stands mid-ground to the right, facing the viewer, while two pedestrians walk away from the viewer further down the street on the right. A white utility truck is partially visible on the far left, with a white car parked further down the street behind it.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the man in the apron moves towards the viewer and exits the frame to the right. Concurrently, the two pedestrians continue walking away, moving deeper into the street from the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a narrow, sunlit cobbled alleyway. To the immediate left, a white utility truck is partially visible, extending from the bottom left corner. Further down the left side, a white Fiat car is parked, facing away from the viewer. In the mid-ground, a man with a blue shirt and backpack walks alongside a woman in a straw hat and backpack, both heading away from the viewer down the alley. On the right, a building wall features a dark green "Public House" sign above a graffiti-covered metal shutter. Buildings with visible windows and shutters line both sides of the alley, leading to a distant background of more buildings and clear sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the man and woman continue walking further away from the first-frame viewpoint, deeper into the alley. The white utility truck, initially positioned immediately to the left of the first-frame viewpoint, is progressively left behind as the camera advances past it. Concurrently, the parked white Fiat car, initially further ahead and to the left of the first-frame viewpoint, appears to approach the viewer as the camera moves towards its stationary position. The buildings lining both sides of the alley, which frame the scene, appear to become closer to the viewer as the camera moves deeper between them, revealing more of their facades that were initially further from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a narrow, cobbled street extending away from the viewer, bathed in sunlight in the mid-distance. To the immediate left, a white Fiat car is parked, partially obscured by a white utility box. Further down the street, two individuals, a man with a blue shirt and backpack and a woman with a hat and backpack, walk away from the viewer. Tall, aged buildings line both sides, with a closed, graffitied metal shutter and a "Public House Brewery" sign on the right-hand building, and a yellow-walled section with a street sign on the left.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the camera slowly advances forward into the street. The two individuals continue walking further away from the first-frame viewpoint, receding deeper into the scene. Concurrently, the parked white Fiat and the utility box on the left gradually shift slightly to the right and downwards in the frame. The buildings lining the street remain static, but more of their facades are revealed as the viewpoint moves forward.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A narrow, cobbled street leads away from the viewer, flanked by tall buildings under a sunny sky. To the left, a white Fiat car is parked in the foreground, with a street sign reading "VICO VIBO" and graffiti on the wall behind it. In the midground, a man and a woman with backpacks walk away from the viewer down the street, followed by other pedestrians visible further in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera subtly pans right, revealing slightly more of the textured wall and closed metal shutter of the right-side building relative to the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, the man and woman, along with other pedestrians, continue moving further away down the street from the viewer's fixed initial position. The parked car and street sign on the left side appear to shift slightly towards the left edge of the initial view as the camera's gaze sweeps right.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a narrow, sunlit cobblestone street flanked by tall, aged buildings; a white car is parked in the foreground on the left, beneath a "VICO DE VITO" street sign, while several people walk away from the viewer down the street into the midground.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the group of people, including the prominent couple, progressively recedes further down the street, moving away from the viewer's original position. Meanwhile, the white car, street sign, and all surrounding buildings remain stationary relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a narrow, sunlit cobbled alleyway flanked by tall, old buildings; a white car is partially visible in the foreground left, and a group of approximately six pedestrians walks away from the viewer into the distance, receding towards the far end of the alley.
end of description
As the camera moves forward through the alley, the white car on the left progressively moves out of view and behind the initial viewpoint. The walking pedestrians continuously recede further down the alley, moving away from the first-frame viewpoint, while the stone buildings on either side pass by, revealing new sections of their facades to the left and right of the initial position. The green graffiti-covered wall on the right also becomes more prominent as the camera advances past its initial location, offering a clearer view of its markings.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a narrow, paved alleyway extending into the distance, flanked by a light-colored building with shop windows on the left and a rough, graffiti-covered wall with green doors on the right. Several pedestrians are visible; a man in a hat and a woman in a blue top walk towards the viewer on the left side of the alley, while a group of people moves away from the viewer further down the passage.
end of description
In the following frames, the man and woman walking towards the viewer continue their approach, eventually passing to the immediate foreground and then to the left and right of the first-frame viewpoint, while the group walking away recedes further into the distant alley.
