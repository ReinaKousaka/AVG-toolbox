An aerial view displays a large, dark grey shingled house with a white cupola and chimney situated in the midground, slightly right of center, surrounded by green foliage and a partial gravel driveway visible to its left. In the background, a sprawling landscape of dark green foliage and lighter marshland leads to a wide blue body of water extending to the horizon, under a clear sky, with distant houses visible far to the left of the main house.

The viewpoint smoothly shifts to the right and slightly back, causing the main house to move left within the frame and revealing more of the gravel driveway to the left of its initial position. As the camera pans, a white fence segment becomes fully visible on the far left side of the now expanded driveway. Additionally, a previously unseen white house emerges in the distant background, further to the right of the water. The subtle camera movement also alters the house's perspective, showcasing more of its left facade than in the first frame.
