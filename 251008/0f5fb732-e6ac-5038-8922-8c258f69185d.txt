frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame depicts an urban road scene viewed from a vehicle moving forward. In the foreground, a multi-lane road is visible, with traffic bollards and a small planted median on the left, separating lanes with a dark sedan and white SUV from the right lane where a white car leads, followed by a yellow and white taxi. Directly overhead in the midground, a large white pedestrian overpass with a truss structure spans the entire width of the frame. In the background, numerous tall buildings and skyscrapers line both sides of the street, with construction cranes visible on the left and a staircase ascending to the overpass on the right, all under a blue sky with scattered clouds. Navigation UI elements are visible in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the large white pedestrian overpass to recede upwards and eventually exit the top of the frame. This movement reveals more of the distant buildings on both sides of the street, which were previously partially obscured by the overpass. The road ahead, initially beneath the overpass, becomes fully visible, and the overall perspective shifts to show the urban environment as the viewer continues driving past the overhead structure.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
In the first frame, the viewer is on a road looking forward, with a white car directly ahead and slightly to the right. A green-bushes-lined median separates the viewer's lane from traffic moving in the same direction to the left, where a dark car is visible. To the right, a multi-story building with a distinctive patterned facade and another tall building with golden characters are visible. Further in the midground, numerous high-rise buildings, including one under construction with a crane, dominate the skyline, while a white van is further down the road in the center. An augmented reality overlay with navigation graphics is present in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing all objects to appear closer to the viewer. The white car ahead and the buildings on either side gradually enlarge and shift slightly to the sides, revealing more of their facades from a closer perspective. The navigation overlay consistently updates, indicating a decreasing distance (e.g., from 701m to 700m) to a destination ahead of the viewer.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows an urban street scene from a moving vehicle's perspective, looking forward. A white car is directly ahead in the center lane. To the immediate left, a green hedge runs alongside a lower-level road or tunnel entrance. On the right, a series of commercial buildings line the street, featuring a patterned facade building in the foreground and a large blue-tinted building behind it. Numerous skyscrapers, including a prominent glass tower on the far left, rise in the midground and background, all under a clear sky. A navigation overlay is visible in the upper-left corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the road. The white car ahead and the white van further in front slowly recede, moving away from the viewer. The buildings on both sides, including the patterned building and the glass skyscraper, gradually move past the viewer towards the background and exit the frame. A pedestrian briefly appears with an umbrella on the far right sidewalk, also moving towards the background relative to the initial viewpoint. The navigation overlay updates to reflect the ongoing journey.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a street scene from a moving vehicle's perspective. A multi-lane road extends directly ahead, with a white car, followed by a white van and a red bus, all moving away from the viewer. To the viewer's immediate left, a lush green bush barrier borders a downward-sloping tunnel entrance. A tall, modern glass skyscraper with an augmented reality navigation overlay dominates the upper-left, while various multi-story commercial buildings line the street to the viewer's right, featuring storefronts and parked bicycles. Distant city buildings and a partly cloudy sky complete the background.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The vehicles directly ahead (white car, van, bus) continue to advance further down the road, increasing their distance relative to the initial first-frame viewpoint. The cityscape to the left and right, including the prominent glass skyscraper and commercial buildings, gradually shifts backward and outward from the center of the frame, moving further to the left and right respectively until they would eventually be behind the first-frame viewpoint, as new portions of the environment ahead are revealed. The navigation overlay in the top-left corner dynamically updates, reflecting the ongoing journey.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
From the viewer's perspective on a multi-lane road, a white sedan is directly ahead, followed by a white van and a red and white bus further right. To the left, a green-bush-lined barrier runs alongside a road leading into a tunnel, with modern high-rise buildings and navigation UI elements in the far left. On the right, a multi-story commercial building with striped cladding and storefronts dominates, extending towards distant cityscapes including a building under construction with a crane and a distinctive white arched structure in the background.
end of description
The scene depicts continuous forward motion along the road. The white sedan, white van, and red and white bus ahead all move forward relative to the viewer, appearing slightly closer and revealing more of the road surface they previously occupied. Concurrently, the buildings on both the left and right sides, including the tunnel entrance and the distant cityscape, gradually recede into the background, confirming the viewer's forward progression. The navigation interface in the top-left updates, showing the vehicle's advancement and a decreasing distance.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows the viewer on a multi-lane city road, with a white car directly ahead and a red and green bus parked on the right alongside a sidewalk. To the left, a raised barrier with green shrubs borders an underpass entrance, while tall skyscrapers line both sides of the street, including a blue-striped "CHINA TELECOM" building on the right. Further ahead in the distance, a construction site with a crane and a white arched pedestrian bridge are visible under a clear sky, with a navigation overlay in the top-left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the road, causing the white car ahead to slightly increase its lead. The bus on the right simultaneously advances, slowly passing the buildings on the right. All other visible objects like the distant skyscrapers, construction site, and the arched bridge steadily approach the viewer, confirming continuous forward movement.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The viewer is positioned on a multi-lane road, looking forward. Directly ahead, a white car is moving away from the viewer. To the immediate right, a red and white bus is partially visible, while a green median with vegetation separates the road on the left. Beyond these, a tall skyscraper with a green navigation overlay is prominent on the left, and a large construction site with scaffolding and a yellow crane is active on the right. In the background, a distinctive white arched bridge is visible under a partly cloudy sky.

end of description

The white car ahead continuously recedes from the viewer's perspective. Concurrently, the red and white bus to the right moves forward, eventually exiting the frame entirely to the right. Following its departure, a motorcyclist emerges from behind where the bus was, proceeding along the right side of the road past the visible construction site. The viewer's continuous forward motion gradually reveals more of the construction area on the right.
