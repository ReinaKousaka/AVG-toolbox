frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame captures a forward view along train tracks curving gently right into the distance. A steep, vegetated embankment with sparse trees and a tall, light-barked tree rises to the left, while a darker, rockier slope with debris, dense coniferous forest, and utility poles with overhead lines occupies the right. An overcast sky covers the upper frame, and "Vmax: 60kmh" is visible at the bottom left.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the tracks, the utility pole on the right moves closer and then exits the frame. The embankments and foreground vegetation on both sides steadily recede as the viewer progresses further into the curve. The dirt path on the left becomes more prominent and then moves out of view, indicating continuous movement through the forested landscape.

From a low perspective, train tracks stretch directly ahead into the distant horizon. To the left, a dirt road runs parallel, bordered by a fence, green grass, and a few trees, including a prominent birch, with distant hills and forests under an overcast sky. To the right, an embankment covered in green and brown foliage rises, featuring a utility pole with overhead wires, leading up to a dense forest of conifers and deciduous trees. "Vmax: 60km/h" is visible in the bottom left.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the utility pole initially on the right recedes and eventually moves out of view to the right. A yellow triangular sign with a black number '9' emerges from the mid-distance to the right of the tracks, slowly approaching the viewer. It continues to get closer and passes the viewer to the right, revealing more of the forested hillside beyond it. The dirt road on the left also continuously recedes to the left, while the landscape directly ahead slowly unfolds.

The first frame shows a train track extending into the distance, flanked on the left by a dirt road and fence, and on the right by a steep, vegetated embankment, all beneath an overcast sky with overhead power lines and "Vmax: 50km/h" at the bottom-left.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses rapidly along the tracks, the initial "Vmax: 50km/h" changes to "90km/h" in the second frame. The fence and dirt road that were adjacent to the left of the viewer pass out of view, while the rocky embankment and forest on the right also recede to the sides. Successive utility poles supporting the overhead lines emerge from the distance, moving closer and then passing the viewer, continuously revealing more of the forested, hilly landscape ahead.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A train track stretches centrally from the foreground into the far distance, flanked by forested slopes on both sides under an overcast sky. A steeper, rocky slope with dense trees borders the right side, while a gentler, more vegetated slope with scattered trees runs along the left. Overhead power lines are visible directly above the tracks, extending forward, and the text 'Vmax: 90km/h' appears in the bottom left corner.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the train tracks. The tracks, alongside the surrounding forested slopes and rocky terrain, continuously emerge from the distant horizon, approaching the viewer before receding to the sides and behind. New sections of the overhead power lines and their support structures also continuously come into view directly ahead. The overall scene remains consistent, depicting a continuous journey through the same type of landscape.
