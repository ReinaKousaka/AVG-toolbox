The first frame displays a snowy, wet road viewed from a low perspective, with a white vehicle hood visible at the bottom. To the left, a grey building with garage doors and a red parking sign stands beside a snow-covered slope and distant trees, while to the right, a yellow building with balconies is similarly flanked by snow and foliage, all framed by snow-capped mountains in the distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the white hood recedes, and the road surface, along with the snowbanks, appears to pass beneath the viewer. A white car inside the left garage entrance and the 'Parking St Michel' sign above it are revealed further along the road from the initial position. Simultaneously, a multi-directional signpost on the right yellow building becomes visible as the scene progresses forward.

The first frame displays a snowy winter street scene. A wet, paved road stretches from the bottom center towards the distant background. To the viewer's left, a snow-covered stone retaining wall supports a slope dense with snow-laden trees, and a sign for "Mont Blanc Tunnel" is visible near the far left. On the right, a snow-covered curb and wooden barriers line a multi-story, light-colored building featuring blue shutters and a brown roof. A large brown signpost with multiple directional signs, indicating places like "Du Clocher" and "Le Genevray," is attached to the upper right side of this building. In the distant background, snow-covered mountains rise under a light sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the wet road. The multi-story building on the right of the first frame appears to shift further left within the frame, gradually revealing its full facade while the brown directional sign moves off-screen to the upper right. A red circular 'no parking' sign emerges on the right, initially positioned directly in front of the building. Simultaneously, a blue square sign with a white arrow appears on the left side of the road, and a dark car, previously in the midground, approaches from the left side of the road, passing the first-frame's position.

A snowy road stretches forward, flanked on the right by a multi-story cream building with blue shutters and balconies, and on the left by snow-covered trees and a retaining wall; a dark car drives away in the left lane, while a red "no stopping" sign and other blue signs are prominently positioned on the right closest to the viewer, all under a pale sky with distant snow-capped mountains.
end of description
The viewpoint advances along the road; the dark car on the left recedes further into the distance, while the traffic signs on the right move past and out of frame behind the viewer's original position. As the camera progresses, more of the building facade on the right and the snowy landscape on the left are revealed, with two dark bins on the left sidewalk becoming visible, and a lighter-colored car emerging in the distant left, approaching the original viewpoint.

In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a wet asphalt road, looking forward down a snowy street. To the immediate left, a silver SUV is parked, facing away, beyond which a snow-covered sidewalk, bare trees, and a large building are visible. To the right, a snow-laden embankment leads to a multi-story building with light walls and blue shutters. In the far distance, snow-capped mountains rise, defining a valley under a pale sky.
end of description
The silver SUV on the left drives past the viewer and out of frame. As the viewer's perspective moves forward along the road, two road signs (a red 'no entry' and a blue 'turn right') initially seen ahead on the left progressively move closer and then pass by. The snow-covered buildings and trees on both sides of the road continuously recede into the background from the first-frame viewpoint, revealing new sections of the street further down. A person walking on the left sidewalk, initially obscured, becomes briefly visible behind the passing road signs.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
A snowy road, partially cleared, extends forward from the viewer, flanked by deep snow banks. To the left, a snow-covered sidewalk runs parallel to the road, lined by bare trees, with a distant person walking and buildings beyond them, set against mountains in the far background. To the right, a large, light-colored multi-story building with blue shutters stands adjacent to the road, partially obscured by snow-laden evergreen trees in the foreground.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the snowy road, the initial building and evergreen trees on the right recede and gradually move out of frame to the right. The person on the left continues walking forward, and a lamppost and several snow-covered wooden fence posts become visible further down on the left side of the road. Eventually, a new, darker building emerges on the right side of the road, replacing the previous structures as the snowy mountains in the background remain constant.
