The first frame depicts a vibrant city street with a food cart on the left foreground, featuring a yellow umbrella and food displays. On the sunlit sidewalk, pedestrians walk in both directions, including a man in a dark jacket moving away and another in a grey blazer approaching the viewer, while reflective buildings flank the street with a white van visible far left.
end of description
Subsequently, the man in the grey blazer walks past the viewer to the left, and the white van on the far left drives away from the viewer, exiting the frame. A woman in a black coat and mask then appears from the far left background, walking towards and past the viewer. Concurrently, an electronic billboard in the left midground changes its display.

In the first frame, a person with their back to the viewer walks away in the foreground, carrying a white bag. To their left, another person wearing a dark coat and face mask walks towards the viewer, holding a cup. Further left, a white police van is parked next to a yellow traffic light pole displaying a 'W 60 ST' sign and a street advertisement kiosk. To the right, a set of stone stairs leads downwards beside a large building with reflective glass windows, while tall buildings line the street in the background under a blue sky.
end of description
The person with their back to the viewer continues walking forward, gradually receding into the distance. Concurrently, the person on the left walks past the parked police van and the street advertisement kiosk, getting closer to the viewer and eventually moving mostly out of the bottom left frame. A group of pedestrians in the midground, initially further down the sidewalk, walks towards the viewer, becoming more prominent as they approach and pass the kiosk.

The first frame shows a sunny city street sidewalk with tall buildings flanking both sides; to the viewer's left is a bus stop shelter with a digital ad and a 'W 60 St' sign, while to the right, a reflective glass building stands adjacent to a granite pillar and stairs in the foreground, with several pedestrians on the path.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the family group initially to the front-left approaches and passes, appearing behind the first-frame viewpoint, while the man in the center moves further ahead. The granite pillar and stairs, initially to the front-right, recede and move entirely out of view, revealing more of the reflective building to its left, relative to the original viewpoint. Concurrently, the digital advertisement on the bus stop shelter, which remains to the left of the initial viewpoint, dynamically cycles its content, displaying "Newsstand" at one point.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a bustling city street with a newsstand and a "W 60 ST" sign on the left, flanked by tall buildings. To the immediate right and slightly in front of the viewer, a person in a black jacket talks on a phone, while another person walks away from the viewer in the center.
end of description
The person on the immediate right moves further right and slightly backward relative to the first-frame viewpoint, eventually leaning against the dark building facade. Simultaneously, the central figure continues walking away down the sidewalk, and two individuals in red jackets emerge from the newsstand area on the left, walking towards the viewer.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a sunny city street scene. On the left, a person in red is partially visible next to a newsstand where an individual in a yellow vest stands, while a white police van is parked on the adjacent street. In the midground, a man carrying bags walks away from the viewer, and to the right, two men are seated against a dark wall, looking at their phones, all framed by numerous tall buildings under a blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera subtly moves forward and slightly to the left. The man in the red jacket moves further left and out of view, while the central man walking away recedes further into the distance. On the right, the two men seated on the wall adjust their positions, with the closer man eventually sitting up and looking forward.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a city street and sidewalk on a clear, sunny day. Directly in front of the viewer, on the right side of the sidewalk, a person in a black jacket walks away, carrying bags. To the viewer's left, a white NYPD police van is parked by a crosswalk, adjacent to a dark trash can, with multiple pedestrians on the sidewalk both approaching and moving away from the viewer. Tall urban buildings line both sides of the street, receding into the background under a bright blue sky.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the person in the black jacket steadily progresses further away from the viewer on the right side of the sidewalk. Simultaneously, a man in a brown jacket and a woman in a red shirt on the left side of the sidewalk move distinctly closer to the first-frame viewpoint. Other pedestrians on the sidewalk continue their movement, either approaching or moving away, while the parked police van and distant city buildings remain largely consistent relative to the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a city street scene on a sunny day, with a wide sidewalk extending into the distance. To the viewer's immediate left, a white NYPD van is parked behind a dark trash can, partially obscured by a man in a grey hoodie walking towards the viewer. Several other pedestrians populate the sidewalk: a woman in a red top behind the first man, another man in a dark coat further back walking towards the viewer, and a man in a dark jacket with a white bag walking away into the midground-right. On the far right, two construction workers in hard hats stand near a dark wall, while tall buildings line both sides of the street in the background.

end of description

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the sidewalk. The man in the grey hoodie and the woman in the red top move past the viewer and exit the frame to the immediate left. Concurrently, the man in the dark coat advances closer towards the viewer's left side, while the man with the white bag continues walking further away into the background. A black sedan becomes more prominent on the street behind the NYPD van to the left, and a new pedestrian, a woman in a dark coat and mask, appears walking towards the viewer further down the sidewalk. The two construction workers to the right remain relatively static as the viewpoint progresses past their original position.
