The first frame displays a rainy city street with a red-brick sidewalk extending into the distance on the left. In the immediate foreground left, a white Hyundai Elantra is partially visible, followed by another white car and a small planter with a red curved object. Beyond this, a row of buildings housing shops and restaurants, like "MEGA COFFEE," lines the street, with several people holding umbrellas walking away from the viewer. On the right, a street pole stands prominently, adjacent to a wet multi-lane road where a silver car with headlights on is in the mid-ground right lane, trailed by a black SUV, all under continuous heavy rain.
end of description
A silver car initially in the mid-ground right lane moves progressively closer to the viewer, entering the foreground right before exiting the frame to the viewer's right. Simultaneously, a black SUV, initially behind it, advances into the mid-ground right. A second silver car appears further back in the right lane, moving forward as the first silver car passes. Later, a white sedan emerges behind the black SUV on the right side of the road, also progressing forward. Throughout, a few pedestrians with umbrellas continue walking away from the viewer on the left sidewalk.
