In the first frame, a person with curly hair, wearing a black puffer jacket, is prominently positioned in the left foreground, looking to the right while holding a phone. Numerous pedestrians populate the midground; to the left, a person in a dark jacket walks away, and further right, individuals in a blue puffer jacket and a red jacket stand. The wet ground displays white lettering, and yellow traffic cones are visible in the mid-right, near a dark statue on a pedestal. In the background, tall buildings are adorned with large, illuminated digital billboards, including a "DEMON SLAYER" ad on the left and "COCA-COLA" and "JESUS" signs on the right, under an overcast sky.

The person in the left foreground slowly turns their head further to the right. In the midground, pedestrians subtly shift positions, particularly the person in the blue puffer jacket, who briefly turns their back to the viewer. A new object, a white umbrella, gradually appears from the distant left midground, moving centrally. The person holding the umbrella becomes more fully revealed as they walk towards the center, positioning themselves between the foreground and the group in the mid-right.

The first frame reveals a bustling, wet city street with reflective pavement in the foreground, populated by several pedestrians in the midground, including a man with his back to the viewer, a woman holding a white umbrella centrally, and two individuals on the right. Towering buildings displaying numerous illuminated billboards and signs, like 'DEMON SLAYER' to the left and 'Prudential' to the right, form the dense background.

In subsequent frames, the two individuals on the mid-right lean closer together, seemingly posing for a picture, then slightly separate. Additionally, more pedestrians become visible moving across the street in the deeper background, passing behind the central figures.
