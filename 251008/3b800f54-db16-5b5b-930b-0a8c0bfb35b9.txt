The first frame shows a grey asphalt road with white double lines leading into the distance. To the immediate right, a silver metal barrier separates the road from a sidewalk crowded with spectators. On the left side of the road, a cyclist in yellow rides past a group of people and a large white bus, with a light brown building featuring "Restaurant Le Pic de l'Ours" beyond them in the midground. Numerous multi-story buildings line the street, extending up green, rocky mountains under a partly cloudy sky in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The cyclist initially on the mid-left quickly moves past the viewer and out of frame to the right. The white bus and the crowd on the left side also recede, with a small quad bike briefly appearing behind the bus before the viewpoint passes it. The spectators behind the barrier on the right side of the road are progressively moved past and out of view, indicating continuous forward motion through the mountainous town.
