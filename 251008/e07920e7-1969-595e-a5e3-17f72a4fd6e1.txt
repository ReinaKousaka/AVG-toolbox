In the first frame, a wet red brick sidewalk extends away from the viewer, with a person holding a white umbrella walking on it. To the left, a metal bicycle rack and guardrail run parallel to the sidewalk, separating it from a wet road where a grey and a red car are visible, bordered by green trees and distant buildings. On the right, a black utility box is attached to a low stone wall adjacent to a white picket fence.
