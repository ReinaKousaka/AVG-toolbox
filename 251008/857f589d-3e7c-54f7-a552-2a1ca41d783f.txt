The first frame captures a narrow, ascending alleyway paved with stone and brick steps interspersed with white pebbles, leading directly away from the viewer. To the immediate left, a black wrought-iron railing with decorative elements is positioned slightly in front of a light-colored building with visible window and door details, adorned with terracotta potted plants. On the right, a textured, light brown wall runs parallel to the steps, featuring a dark metal handrail and various plants growing in pots and clinging to the wall.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly advances forward and slightly upward along the stepped alley, revealing more of the path ahead. The black wrought-iron railing on the left foreground slowly extends further into the bottom left of the frame, showcasing additional ornate details and revealing more of the building facade behind it. Concurrently, the lower steps progressively recede from view, replaced by the gradual revelation of the steps further up the path as the camera's perspective moves deeper into the alley.

The first frame shows an uphill stone staircase with terracotta inserts between two buildings, bordered by a dark metal railing on the lower left and a weathered wall with a handrail on the right. A yellow building wall on the left features a dark doorway and mailbox, with potted plants lining the stairs leading upwards.
end of description
Subsequently, sunlight progressively illuminates the scene, causing shadows on the left building wall, particularly around the mailbox, to gradually recede, brightening that area relative to the viewer's left. The illumination on the staircase and the right wall also dynamically shifts as time passes, revealing no new objects or scenes, only evolving light and shadow patterns across the existing environment.

The first frame depicts a narrow, ascending staircase paved with cobblestones and brown tiles, flanked by tall buildings under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's immediate left, a light yellow stucco wall features a dark brown door with a white frame and the number '19', with potted plants at its base. To the right, a rugged stone wall with a metal handrail rises, displaying numerous potted plants clinging to its surface, transitioning to a lighter building with barred windows further up.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the scene remains static except for a dynamic shift in lighting. Shadows progressively deepen and lengthen across the left wall and the ascending steps, moving upwards and to the right, indicating the sun's movement across the sky. Simultaneously, the sunlit areas on the right wall and upper parts of the scene gradually diminish.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a narrow, upward-sloping alleyway or staircase. To the left, a light yellow wall features a partially visible dark brown door and the number '15'. The path consists of steps with dark tiled treads and light pebbled risers, lined by numerous potted plants on both sides. To the right, a two-toned wall (dark grey at the bottom, light yellow top) has a dark metal railing, multiple hanging potted plants, and a dark-barred window higher up. In the far foreground on the right, a mossy rock formation with a rope is visible. The alley ascends between buildings towards a patch of blue sky.

end of description

The sunlit area on the left wall and staircase dynamically expands, progressively illuminating more of the upper steps and the wall while the shadow from the right wall recedes. A vertical dark pipe or wire on the upper left wall becomes more prominent as the sunlight reaches it. The mossy rock structure on the far right gradually moves out of the frame, revealing more of the lower right wall. The hanging potted plant closest to the viewer on the right subtly shifts further right and slightly downwards.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a narrow, sunlit uphill alleyway. Steps made of stone and brick lead into the distance, flanked by numerous potted plants. A yellow building wall on the right features a dark window with decorative ironwork, two hanging white plant pots, and a dark handrail running upwards. On the left, another yellow building wall rises, and a sliver of blue sky is visible at the top in the distant background.
end of description
All subsequent frames are identical to the first, showing no dynamic changes, movement, or newly revealed objects or scenes from the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a narrow, ascending alleyway with cobblestone and brick steps, bordered by light yellow buildings. Potted plants are positioned along the steps and walls on both sides, with a dark wooden door, an overhead lamp, and hanging planters visible on the right wall, which also features a dark handrail along its lower grey section; a dark pipe runs along the far left edge.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the lighting subtly brightens and shadows gently shift. A gray rectangular object progressively appears on the right wall, to the left of the hanging planter and above the handrail, gradually revealing itself more completely as if sliding from right to left relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a narrow, ascending alleyway framed by light yellow plastered buildings. To the viewer's left, an open, stone-framed doorway is visible further back, with several flower pots arranged at the base of the wall. To the right, a closed brown wooden door is present, featuring a dark green lantern above it and two gray utility boxes positioned on the wall and a dark surface below, with more flower pots in the foreground. A winding staircase of stone and tile ascends into the distance, lined with various potted plants on its steps.
end of description
In the following frames, the gray rectangular utility box on the lower right wall subtly shifts slightly to the right and upward relative to the first-frame viewpoint, gradually revealing a small section of the yellow wall previously hidden to its left.
