The first frame depicts a wet, dark city street at night with heavy rainfall. In the foreground, a pedestrian crosswalk with prominent white stripes extends across the road from the left, leading away from the viewer, with a white arrow painted on the asphalt. To the right, a yellow tactile paving strip runs along the sidewalk, featuring three illuminated bollards positioned further along this strip. Streetlights line both sides of the road, reflecting brightly on the wet surface, with green trees visible behind them. In the distance, buildings with lights and a blue traffic sign are visible above the road.

Throughout the sequence, the heavy rain persists, creating ripples and enhanced reflections on the wet road. The three glowing bollards on the sidewalk to the viewer's right gradually dim and vanish by the fifth frame. Subsequently, a vertical structure with orange and black diagonal stripes emerges further along the sidewalk to the right, behind the original bollard positions, becoming more defined by the final frames.
