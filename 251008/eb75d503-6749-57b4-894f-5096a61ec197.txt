The first frame shows a wet, rain-slicked street at night, illuminated by various streetlights and building lights, reflecting off the ground. A tall utility pole with yellow and black striped markings and an orange sign stands prominently in the mid-left foreground. To the right of the utility pole, a person in a pink top walks away from the viewer on the wet sidewalk, past two yellow sandwich board signs. Buildings with illuminated storefronts and some foliage line both sides of the street, receding into the distance under a dark sky where rain is visibly falling.

In the following frames, the person on the right sidewalk opens a white umbrella, which was previously unseen, to shield themselves from the continuous rain. Subsequently, a white car appears from the viewer's left, entering the wet road segment in front of the utility pole. This car then proceeds to drive away from the viewer, moving down the street past the utility pole, while the person continues walking with their open umbrella. The car gradually recedes into the distance further down the street as the sequence progresses.

The first frame depicts a rainy night on a city street, with a dark pole dominating the foreground left. A wet asphalt road, reflecting vibrant streetlights, extends into the distance, flanked by illuminated buildings; a white car proceeds down the street, and a person with a white umbrella walks away on the right sidewalk, past a yellow sign.
end of description
Over the following frames, the white car moves further into the distance, and the person on the right sidewalk continues their movement away from the viewer. Meanwhile, several new pedestrians emerge on the left sidewalk, initially further down the street, gradually approaching the viewer and some eventually crossing the road.

In the first frame, a wet, dark city street stretches from the foreground into the background, flanked by sidewalks and buildings under a night sky. Double yellow lines delineate the center of the asphalt road, reflecting numerous streetlights and distant traffic lights, one of which is yellow directly above the midground. On the right sidewalk in the foreground, a yellow A-frame sign with Korean text is visible, while three pedestrians holding umbrellas are dispersed along the sidewalks: two on the left (one walking away, one towards the viewer) and one on the right (walking away).
end of description
Across subsequent frames, the three pedestrians continue their movement relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The person with the white umbrella on the left sidewalk progresses further into the midground, moving away from the viewer. Concurrently, the person with the dark umbrella on the left sidewalk advances towards the foreground, passing the other pedestrian before exiting the frame to the viewer's left. Meanwhile, the pedestrian on the right sidewalk with a light-colored umbrella also proceeds further into the midground, moving away from the viewer.
