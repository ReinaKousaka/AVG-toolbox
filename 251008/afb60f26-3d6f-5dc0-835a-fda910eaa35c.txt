The first frame shows a wide city street looking into the distance, with a brown building on the left and a large light-colored building on the right, both adorned with green trees along their sidewalks. In the foreground on the right, a black van and a black taxi are visible, while a red fire truck is positioned further down the road on the left. Tall, modern buildings line the street in the background under a clear blue sky, with pedestrians scattered along the sidewalks.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the black van and the black taxi on the right move forward away from the viewer, eventually exiting the frame entirely to the right, revealing the previously obscured pavement and a few pedestrians behind them. The red fire truck on the left side of the road remains largely stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint, though it might be moving very slowly forward. The overall street scene and buildings remain unchanged in their spatial positions.

The first frame displays a wide city street with a dark asphalt road featuring white crosswalk markings in the foreground. Tall buildings line both sides of the street, with lush green trees in the midground center and left. A red fire truck is visible in the distance on the left side of the road, approaching the viewer. On the right sidewalk, a group of pedestrians stands near a grey, open-sided structure, with a blue square sign attached to a pole above it.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly pans to the right, revealing more of the large building on the right side of the street. The fire truck moves further left and eventually out of frame, as do the trees previously on the left. New sections of the right sidewalk and street are progressively revealed, along with additional pedestrians and a red circular speed limit sign appearing further to the right.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, an asphalt road with white lane markings and a pedestrian crossing occupies the foreground, extending towards the right. To the left, a multi-story, light-colored building with numerous windows and a covered entrance structure stands in the mid-ground, featuring a blue square sign on its far-left corner and green trees along its facade. On the right, a sidewalk populated by several pedestrians runs parallel to the road, where a black pole supports traffic lights and two circular road signs—a blue no-entry and a red '40' speed limit—in the mid-ground. In the background, modern skyscrapers are visible on the right.
end of description
As the viewpoint pans to the right, the initial light-colored building on the left gradually moves out of frame, revealing more of the bustling city street further to its right. Pedestrians continue walking along the sidewalk and a few white vehicles appear on the road, driving away from the viewer. A distinctive red brick building with an ornate roof and turrets emerges into view in the mid-ground, further to the right of the initial road signs, accompanied by additional tall glass buildings in the distant background.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A paved road with a white crosswalk and lane markings occupies the foreground and midground, leading towards the background where a white van is to the right and a smaller white car is in the center lane. To the viewer's left, a large, light-colored building stands beside a sidewalk with trees and pedestrians, featuring a street pole with a 'no entry' and '40' speed limit sign, and a black traffic light. To the right, a historic red-brick building with a distinctive domed roof is visible, with modern glass skyscrapers towering in the background behind it and in the center.
end of description
The white van and the smaller white car on the road both move forward slightly towards the background. Pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue to move along the street. A red light illuminates within the black traffic light box, located to the left of the viewer, and remains red. A black car appears on the right side of the road, behind the white van, also moving forward.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a multi-lane city street looking forward, with a modern, light-colored building and a busy sidewalk with pedestrians and trees to the viewer's left. To the right, a historic red-brick building with a domed roof (likely a station) stands prominently, backed by tall glass skyscrapers. On the road, a silver car is in the left lane and a white van in the right lane ahead, with a red traffic light visible further down the road. end of description. Subsequently, the silver car in the left lane moves forward and turns right, while the white van in the right lane also progresses. Additional vehicles appear and move within the intersection area ahead and to the right, as the traffic light changes from red to green.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a multi-lane road with white lane markings leading towards an intersection, bordered by a sidewalk with pedestrians and trees on the left, and traffic on the right. In the background, a historic reddish-brown building with a prominent domed roof is visible on the right, while tall, modern glass skyscrapers dominate the left, all under a clear sky.
end of description
Subsequently, the traffic light at the intersection transitions from red to yellow/orange. Concurrently, the silver car in the left lane and the white van and black car in the right lane all move forward, progressing deeper into the scene relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a city street with a gray hatchback on the left and a white van on the right, both facing away, flanking an intersection. In the midground, a red brick historic building with a domed roof is to the right, while a sidewalk with pedestrians, trees, and a street light with a red traffic signal are on the left. Behind these, modern glass skyscrapers rise into the sky.
end of description
The gray hatchback and white van both slowly move forward, away from the viewer. Concurrently, a black sedan, initially turning left in the midground, completes its turn across the intersection, moving out of view. Throughout these movements, the traffic light on the left transitions from red to amber.
