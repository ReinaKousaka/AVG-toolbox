The first frame displays an urban street scene looking forward, with a row of red-brick buildings featuring black staircases and railings dominating the left side, and a bare tree in a planter in the left foreground. A paved sidewalk extends forward from the viewer, while the street on the right is marked by orange traffic cones and barriers, leading to a construction truck and tall modern buildings in the distant background, where a blue billboard reads "EYES UP HERE."

As the frames progress, a construction worker in an orange vest is seen walking away from the viewer, moving further down the street on the right side. The immediate foreground pavement recedes, revealing new signage on the left-side buildings, such as "APA" and "ESPRESSO BAR," and a black bicycle leaning against the fence just behind the bare tree from the initial viewpoint. Yellow caution tape also becomes more prominent across the construction area on the right, extending further into the scene.

The first frame depicts a city street with a paved sidewalk on the left, lined by older red brick buildings, one featuring an "ESPRESSO BAR" sign. To the right of the viewer, the street transforms into a construction zone, marked by orange cones, yellow tape, a red dump truck, a worker in an orange suit, and modern high-rise buildings in the distant background.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily moves forward along the sidewalk, causing immediate foreground objects like the initial black fences and a light pole to exit the left side of the frame. Simultaneously, the construction worker on the right side of the street moves from a distant position towards the viewer, passing several orange cones. The red dump truck slowly recedes further down the street, moving away from the viewer's original position. The scene ahead continually expands, revealing more of the ongoing construction activity on the right as the brick buildings on the left shift closer and then eventually out of view.
