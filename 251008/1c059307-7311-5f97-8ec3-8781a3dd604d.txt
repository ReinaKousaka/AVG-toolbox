In the first frame, a wide urban street scene unfolds from the perspective of someone standing on a crosswalk. Directly in front, pedestrians walk away from the viewer across the white-striped crosswalk. To the viewer's left, a sidewalk features more pedestrians, a fire hydrant, and the facade of a building displaying "ACADIA," alongside a traffic light pole with a green bicycle signal and a red "Don't Walk" sign. To the right of the crosswalk, a street extends into the background, populated by cars, a yellow taxi, and a blue bus; a person also walks on the crosswalk's right edge, moving away. Tall buildings line both sides of the street, with steam rising from one on the far right, all under a partially cloudy sky.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the pedestrians on the crosswalk continue to move forward, progressing further into the background. In the fifth frame, the red 'Don't Walk' signal on the left changes to a numerical countdown displaying '6', which then shifts to '5' in the sixth frame and remains at '5' for the rest of the sequence. A lone individual on the right side of the crosswalk also advances away from the viewer, eventually walking off the right side of the frame. In the final frame, the text "6th AVENUE" is newly displayed as an overlay in the bottom left portion of the scene.

The first frame presents a vibrant city street scene with a wide sidewalk along the left and a road on the right. In the immediate foreground left, a pedestrian pole features a traffic light displaying a red '5' countdown, with "6th AVENUE" overlaid at the bottom. The mid-ground left is populated by numerous pedestrians, primarily walking away from the viewer along the sidewalk, while a woman in a purple top, conversing on a phone, walks towards the viewer on the mid-ground right, positioned at the edge of a crosswalk. In the background right, a street filled with cars and a blue bus extends beneath tall buildings, some emitting steam, with a prominent digital kiosk visible in the center background under a partly cloudy sky.

end of description

The red countdown on the pedestrian traffic light decreases sequentially from '5' to '0' through the frames. The woman in the purple top on the mid-ground right steadily advances forward (towards the viewer) across the crosswalk. Simultaneously, the large group of pedestrians on the left sidewalk continues moving further away into the distance. Additional individuals emerge from the background right to cross the street and from the far left walking towards the viewer. Vehicles in the background, including a white SUV and a blue bus, slowly progress further away from the viewer down the street.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
On the left, a bustling city sidewalk is bordered by a multi-story building with large windows; a man in a black jacket walks towards the viewer on the far left, while several people move away further down the sidewalk beside green foliage. To the right, a digital advertising kiosk and a street pole stand next to a busy street, with vehicles and tall buildings receding into the background under a partly cloudy sky.

end of description

As frames progress, the viewer moves forward, causing the man on the left to pass by and the group ahead to recede further into the distance. Subsequently, a pigeon appears on the right sidewalk near the street pole, and a red item becomes visible on the sidewalk next to the digital screen.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a city sidewalk along '6th AVENUE' with a man in a white shirt on the far left and another in a green tank top walking leftward in the mid-ground. A group of pedestrians walks away from the viewer on the sidewalk, adjacent to a building with large glass windows on the left. On the right, a digital advertising kiosk, a utility pole, and a street vendor's display of goods on the ground are visible, with cars and distant buildings emitting steam forming the background.
end of description
The man in the white shirt moves out of the frame to the left, and the man in the green tank top continues walking leftward, also exiting the scene. The group of pedestrians proceeds further away on the sidewalk towards the background. A pigeon newly appears and walks on the sidewalk near the utility pole and trash bag on the right.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents an urban street view, with two women walking away from the viewer on a paved sidewalk in the center. To the left, a building with large display windows extends into the background, while to the right, a tall digital advertisement kiosk stands, adjacent to a vendor's display of small items on the sidewalk. Beyond these, a street with parked cars and distant buildings fills the background under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
The viewer continuously moves forward along the 6th Avenue sidewalk. The two women and other pedestrians ahead gradually move further into the midground and background, as the digital kiosk and vendor's display on the right slowly exit the frame. Concurrently, vehicles in the background traffic lane slowly shift positions, and steam becomes visible rising from a distant building on the right.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a sunny city sidewalk is bustling with pedestrians; a street vendor's display occupies the foreground-right, while two young women and other pedestrians walk away from the viewer in the midground, flanked by a building with large glass windows on the left and a street with parked cars, a distant bus, and tall buildings (one emitting steam) on the right, with "6th AVENUE" text displayed in the bottom left.

end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the sidewalk, the foreground-right street vendor's display recedes and moves entirely out of frame, while the two young women and other pedestrians ahead continue walking as the viewer approaches and passes other individuals. This progression reveals more of the building storefronts on the left and the ongoing street traffic to the right, concurrently with the disappearance of the '6th AVENUE' text overlay.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows two girls walking away from the viewer on a city sidewalk. To their left, a building with large glass windows and an awning stretches along, with other pedestrians ahead, while to their right, a street contains multiple cars, a distant yellow bus, and a large vertical screen displaying dark content, with pedestrians nearby and tall buildings under a partially cloudy sky.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the girls continue walking, revealing clearer views of the pedestrians on the left sidewalk. The large screen on the right displays different visuals, and the person standing by it turns slightly, while other distant pedestrians and vehicles on the street subtly shift, bringing more of the foreground into view relative to the initial viewpoint.
