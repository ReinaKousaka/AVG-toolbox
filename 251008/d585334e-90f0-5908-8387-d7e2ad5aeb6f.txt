In the first frame, two parallel train tracks curve towards the right and recede into the distance, filling the lower central portion of the view. To the left, a tall utility pole with overhead wires is prominent, with a vegetated embankment and a graffiti-covered retaining wall behind it. Further back on the left, a small white building, residential structures with illuminated windows, and a park area are visible. On the right, dense bushes and trees line the tracks, with a large, modern-looking building with lit windows visible in the mid-distance. The sky is overcast and bluish, indicative of twilight, and "Vmax: 60KM/h" appears in the bottom left corner.

As the viewpoint advances along the tracks, the utility pole on the left moves out of frame, revealing more of the graffiti-covered retaining wall and the park area behind it. The surrounding landscape, including the vegetation on both sides and the distant buildings, shifts past the viewer, indicating forward motion along the curving railway line.

The first frame depicts a train track view at dusk, with two tracks curving gently right into the distance. To the immediate left, a concrete wall adorned with graffiti runs alongside a grassy embankment leading to a playground and multi-story residential buildings further back. A prominent overhead power line pole stands to the left of the tracks, connected by wires traversing the upper sky. On the right, a dense bank of green trees and bushes borders the tracks, with another building visible uphill further in the background, and a large, lit building centered behind the curving tracks.
end of description
The scene exhibits continuous forward motion along the tracks. Objects initially to the left, including the graffiti wall, playground, and residential buildings, progressively recede and pass the viewpoint. The overhead power line pole, initially prominent to the left, shifts further left and eventually moves out of frame as the viewer advances along the tracks, revealing new sections of the environment ahead.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows two parallel train tracks curving slightly to the right, extending into the middle ground from the viewer's forward perspective. Green foliage, bushes, and trees line both sides of the tracks, with a large grey building with illuminated windows visible behind a fence on the left, and distant apartment blocks beyond it. Overhead power lines and a utility pole are prominent in the upper middle section, while a tree-covered embankment rises on the right side, all under an overcast evening sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the foreground foliage passes out of view to the sides, and the overhead pole shifts left. A white triangular sign to the left of the tracks approaches and then moves out of the frame to the left. Further along the tracks, traffic lights displaying green and red signals become more distinct to the right, and the initial large building on the left recedes as new urban elements emerge further into the scene.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A train track extends directly forward, slightly curving right, flanked by a triangular yellow sign on the left foreground and green foliage on a slope to the right. To the left, a large, light grey building with illuminated windows sits further back, while overhead power lines traverse the sky above distant buildings and railway signals ahead, all under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the initial triangular yellow sign on the left recedes and passes out of view. Concurrently, a new yellow sign, featuring a prominent '7', gradually appears and moves closer on the right side of the tracks. The surrounding landscape of foliage, buildings, and railway infrastructure steadily approaches and passes the viewer, indicating continuous forward motion.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows the viewer looking straight down parallel train tracks, which diverge slightly to the right in the midground, with a "Vmax: 60KM/h" indicator in the bottom left. To the left, a large modern building with illuminated windows sits on an elevated green embankment, while to the right, a steep, tree-covered hill features a yellow triangular sign with a '7'. Overhead power lines crisscross above the tracks, and a green signal light is visible further down the track in the center.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint advances along the tracks, causing the yellow triangular sign on the right and a streetlamp on the left to move closer and exit the frame laterally. A brown electrical box and a new pole appear from the midground on the left, drawing nearer to the viewer. Concurrently, the speed indicator increases from 60KM/h to 95KM/h, and the distant green signal light ahead appears to approach the viewer.
