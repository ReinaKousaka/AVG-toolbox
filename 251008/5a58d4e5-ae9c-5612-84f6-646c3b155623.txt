In the first frame, a green dump truck laden with rocks drives rightward in the midground through a roundabout, which features a central island with flags and flowers. In the foreground left are traffic signs and a dark car entering the roundabout, all set against a backdrop of a large, forested mountain and houses.

The dump truck continues its clockwise movement through the roundabout, steadily advancing rightward relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the black car, initially on the viewer's left, progresses around the roundabout and eventually moves across its far side. Another dark car emerges from the right side of the roundabout in the mid-background, driving leftward as the scene progresses.

The first frame captures a road leading into a roundabout in a mountainous region, with a black car on the left entering the traffic circle and a green dump truck laden with rocks on the right approaching it. The central island of the roundabout is landscaped with flowers and features multiple flags, including Germany, Austria, and Italy, while houses and dense forests cover the surrounding mountains under a bright blue sky.
end of description
Both vehicles proceed clockwise around the roundabout; the black car moves from the left towards the center, and the dump truck shifts from the right towards the center-right. As they move, other vehicles become visible behind the dump truck to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, and a white car emerges from the far left behind the roundabout.

In the foreground, a paved road curves from the bottom right towards the left, bordering a circular grassy island with red and yellow flowers on the left. On this island, a blue circular sign with a white right-pointing arrow is visible, along with multiple flagpoles displaying the flags of Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy, and possibly Austria. A dark grey car is on the road in the center, moving left, while a large green and white truck is further along the road to the right. The midground features several houses with brown roofs nestled among trees, set against a backdrop of steep, tree-covered mountains that dominate the left and center background, under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds.
end of description
The dark grey car in the foreground advances into the roundabout, turning left, and exits the frame to the far left. Simultaneously, the green and white truck, positioned further right on the road, moves forward along that road, progressively exiting the frame to the right. Following this, a dark blue car enters the frame from the right, proceeding into the roundabout and turning left. Subsequently, another dark sedan becomes visible on the far side of the roundabout, turning right onto the road where the truck exited, and a white car also appears further along this road from the far right, moving forward.
