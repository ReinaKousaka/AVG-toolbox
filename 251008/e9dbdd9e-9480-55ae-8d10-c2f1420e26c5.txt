In the first frame, an urban street scene unfolds. To the viewer's right, an outdoor dining area with wooden tables and benches sits in the foreground, partially revealing a person in a white top at a table. Immediately behind this, a dark-colored building with an open entrance and an external fire escape rises, with string lights overhead. On the sidewalk stretching into the mid-ground from the left, a man walking a light brown dog on a red leash is followed by another person with a backpack, near a large potted plant. Further down the sidewalk to the left, a glass-paneled outdoor dining structure lines the street, while a car is partially visible in the far left lane. In the background, numerous buildings, including modern skyscrapers, pierce a cloudy sky.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the man with the dog and the person behind him continue walking on the sidewalk, progressively approaching the viewer. Simultaneously, a red stanchion or pole gradually emerges into view from the far right edge of the frame, positioned at the corner of the outdoor dining area. The person seated at the table on the right remains relatively static, appearing slightly more visible in some frames.

In the first frame, a bearded man with a light brown dog on a red leash is in the foreground, left of center, walking along a sidewalk next to a dark grey building with an open doorway on the right. Further down the sidewalk on the left, another man walks past a transparent outdoor dining structure, while tall city buildings rise in the background, including a distinctive skyscraper.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the man and dog walk further away and exit the frame to the left, while the grey building's entrance moves off-frame right, revealing more of its long facade and windows. A new man in a grey hoodie appears walking towards the viewer from the left, along with a person on a scooter moving away from the viewer in the midground, both appearing ahead of the initial first-frame viewpoint. The street and background buildings become more prominent as the initial foreground structures recede from view.

In the first frame, a man in a grey hoodie and black cap is visible in the foreground on the left, facing the viewer. To his left, a sidewalk dining area enclosed by glass panels and a dark barrier extends towards the background, with a dark car parked behind it and two orange cones and a metal bike rack in front. To the viewer's right, a dark building with multiple large, reflective windows stretches into the distance, reflecting city structures and the sky. In the background, a street is visible with cars, pedestrians, and numerous city buildings, including a prominent modern skyscraper under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
The man in the foreground gradually moves to the viewer's left and exits the frame. Simultaneously, the viewpoint slowly advances forward along the sidewalk, revealing more of the street and the restaurant patio to the left. The dark car parked there and the person walking away from the viewer on the sidewalk recede further into the mid-distance. The reflections in the building's windows on the right subtly shift with the changing perspective.

The viewer is on a city sidewalk, with an outdoor dining structure and a dark SUV parked to the left. To the right, a dark building with multiple reflective windows extends forward, and straight ahead, a person walks away from the viewer, with distant buildings, street signs, and traffic visible.
end of description
In the following frames, the person on the sidewalk continues to walk further away from the viewer, receding into the distance. All other visible objects, including the parked SUV, the outdoor dining structure, and the buildings, remain stationary throughout the sequence.

The first frame shows a city street from a sidewalk viewpoint. To the left, a dark SUV is parked, partially obscuring an orange cone, next to a pole with street signs. A dark building with reflective windows lines the right, while a person walks away on the sidewalk ahead, past a garbage can and street furniture, towards a busy intersection with traffic lights and distant city buildings.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly shifts forward and right over subsequent frames. The orange cone on the bottom left disappears, and the parked SUV moves forward, partially exiting the frame as a white van from further back on the street advances into view on the left. The walking person moves further away, and a 'W 23 ST' street sign becomes clearer in the distance as the scene progresses.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a city street view from a sidewalk. On the immediate left, a dark car is parked by a bike rack, while a dark building with large windows lines the right foreground. Ahead, a red banner flag and trash can stand on the sidewalk next to a pole with a 'W 23 ST' sign and traffic lights, with a white van and a pedestrian visible further down the street.
end of description
The white van and pedestrian move further down the street, away from the viewer. Subsequently, a dark pickup truck, then a white sedan, are revealed on the left side, also moving away. Concurrently, a woman enters the far left foreground walking towards the viewer, and a yellow taxi appears on the far left, driving rightward across the street.
