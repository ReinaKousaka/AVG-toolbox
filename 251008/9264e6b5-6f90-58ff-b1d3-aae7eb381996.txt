The first frame presents a traditional Chinese garden scene, with a pebbled pathway curving from the viewer's foreground into the mid-ground on the left. To the immediate left, a lush green pine tree dominates the frame, next to a bamboo fence and a collection of large, stacked rocks. On the right, a white-walled covered walkway with an ornate dark tiled roof and support pillars extends into the distance, featuring hanging red lanterns and a decorative lattice window, with a person in white walking away further down the corridor.

The viewpoint slowly advances forward and slightly to the right, gradually revealing more of the path and the covered walkway. A dark signpost appears on the left side of the path, closer to the viewer. As the movement continues, red chili-like decorations become visible hanging within the covered walkway, and the entire scene unfolds further into the distance relative to the initial view.
