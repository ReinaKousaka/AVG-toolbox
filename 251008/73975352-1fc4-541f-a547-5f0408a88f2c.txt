The first frame displays a rain-soaked street scene with a wet brick sidewalk and a line of trees on the left, adjacent to a metal railing and three large planters in the foreground to the right. A wet asphalt road with double yellow lines stretches into the distance on the right, featuring a dark grey minivan approaching the viewer among other distant vehicles under an overcast sky.

The dark grey minivan proceeds past the viewer and exits to the right, as a white SUV behind it and then a red SUV emerge from the background, driving forward along the road. Subsequently, another dark SUV with headlights also appears from the distant background, continuing the steady traffic flow towards the viewer along the wet asphalt.

The first frame displays a wet, rainy street scene viewed from a sidewalk. To the viewer's left, a brick sidewalk extends into the distance, bordered by trees and a dark metal railing, with two large flower planters holding yellow and red flowers in the mid-ground. To the right, a multi-lane road, slick with rain and reflecting light, shows a dark sedan with headlights on in the immediate foreground, moving away from the viewer, alongside other vehicles further down the road. Traffic lights and road signs are visible in the far distance above the moving cars.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the dark sedan on the right side of the road continues to move further away from the viewer, receding into the distance. Other vehicles on the road also advance, shifting their positions further down the street away from the first-frame viewpoint. A white sedan becomes increasingly prominent in the mid-ground right, moving forward on the road, while the overall rainy conditions persist.

The first frame captures a rainy street scene from a sidewalk perspective. To the viewer's left, a wet, brick-patterned sidewalk extends into the midground, bordered by several green trees. In the foreground, two large dark planters, one with yellow flowers closest to the viewer and another with red flowers behind it, sit near the pavement edge. A black metal fence separates the sidewalk from a wet, multi-lane road on the right, where numerous vehicles, including a distant green bus, are visible in heavy rain. A utility pole stands mid-frame, and traffic lights and street signs are discernible further down the overcast road.

Following the initial scene, a white sedan in the middle lane approaches the viewer from the mid-distance on the road, then passes from the mid-right towards the far right of the frame. Subsequently, a white SUV emerges from the background in the middle lane, also approaching the viewer's first-frame position on the road. Throughout these movements, the rain consistently falls.
