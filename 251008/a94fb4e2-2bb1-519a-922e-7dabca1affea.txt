The first frame depicts a multi-lane city street at dusk, viewed from a car's perspective, looking forward towards an intersection. A dark blue sedan occupies the center-left lane directly in front of the viewer, followed by a white sedan and a dark SUV further ahead. To the right, a white SUV is partially visible entering the frame, with a modern building featuring green elements behind it. Overhead, multiple traffic lights are green, illuminating various buildings with billboards, including "The Dissident" and one featuring a person, located further down the street to the left. The sky is overcast with subtle purple and blue hues.

The white SUV on the viewer's right progressively moves forward, and its brake lights briefly illuminate before it exits the frame to the right. Simultaneously, the dark blue sedan directly in front of the viewer and other vehicles ahead slowly advance forward. Further along, a dark sedan in the adjacent left lane also moves forward. Towards the later frames, a billboard on the far left changes its illuminated content, and an overhead traffic light on the far left transitions from green to a darkened state.

The first frame displays a multi-lane city street scene at dusk, looking forward from a vehicle at an intersection. In the immediate foreground, pavement and a white left-turn arrow are visible. Multiple cars occupy the mid-ground, with a dark car in the left lane and a dark blue car in the center lane directly ahead, all facing away from the viewer. Along the mid-ground's left and center, buildings with illuminated windows suggest businesses, beneath which is a street sign indicating "STATE". Traffic lights showing green hang overhead and to the right. In the background, prominent billboards are mounted above the buildings, power lines crisscross the sky, and trees line the right side of the street, with a tall building partially visible on the far right. The sky above is cloudy with soft twilight hues.

The black car in the mid-ground left lane progressively moves forward towards the viewer. The traffic lights on the far right and to the viewer's left both transition from green to yellow, then to red. Concurrently, the street sign "Holloway Dr â†’" becomes fully visible above the central intersection, and a new street sign "Sunset Blvd" appears further right. In the final frames, the traffic light directly ahead of the viewer also changes from green to yellow, then red, as a dark vehicle from the right lane starts entering the intersection.

First, the frame displays a multi-lane road with cars heading away from the viewer, marked by white crosswalks and yellow lines, bordered by a red curb on the right. To the right, a building featuring "STATE SOCIAL HOUSE" signage is visible, topped by a large billboard advertising "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," with traffic lights and a "Holloway Dr" sign further right and above. On the left, a black SUV is closest, and further down a large digital billboard shows an image of people.

As the viewpoint moves forward, the right-side traffic lights and "Holloway Dr" sign recede behind the initial viewpoint. The "Ma Rainey" billboard also passes out of view to the right, revealing more of the "STATE SOCIAL HOUSE" building and a newly visible "fresh" storefront further down on the right. Concurrently, a red construction crane appears further left, while the large digital billboard on the left repeatedly changes its displayed advertisement content.
