A tall, multi-tiered, ornate stone pagoda dominates the center of the first frame, featuring carved figures and intricate details on each level, with steps leading up to its base. In the foreground, low fences adorned with numerous reddish-brown tags line both the left and right sides of the pathway leading to the pagoda. Traditional-style buildings with dark, multi-tiered roofs are visible in the mid-ground to the left and right of the pagoda, with a green coniferous tree also present to the right. The sky above is cloudy and light blue, with several small dark birds flying in the upper-left. A small red sign rests at the foot of the pagoda steps.

In subsequent frames, several small dark birds continually shift their flight paths across the sky to the left of the pagoda. From the eighth frame, two people appear walking from the right, behind the prayer fences, just to the right of the pagoda's base. They continue to move slightly further right towards the edge of the frame in the final image.

A tall, multi-tiered stone pagoda with intricate carvings stands centrally, flanked by traditional buildings to its left and right, with a conifer tree behind the right building. Stone steps with a wooden railing ascend towards the pagoda on the left, while a fence covered in numerous hanging decorative tags stretches across the mid-ground to the right, where three people are visible.
end of description
The camera slowly pans right across the scene. The central pagoda and the fence with tags shift left relative to the viewer, with the left-side stone steps becoming more prominent. Simultaneously, the three people on the right move further right, nearing the frame's edge, as the traditional building on the far right becomes more centered, and the left building almost disappears from view.

In the foreground, a gray stone staircase with a light brown banister ascends to the left. To the left of the stairs stands a multi-tiered, ornate light brown pagoda-like structure adorned with carvings and bells. In the mid-right, a wall extensively covered with hanging charms or plaques stretches horizontally, behind which a traditional dark-roofed building and a tree are visible. Two people in white shirts stand at the right end of this wall, facing away from the viewer, next to a stone dragon head carving on the wall. The ground is paved, and a cloudy sky is overhead.
end of description
The two people on the right progressively move further right and eventually out of the frame. As they exit, the camera subtly pans right relative to the initial viewpoint, causing the stone dragon head on the charm-covered wall to shift from the mid-right towards a more central position. This gradual pan reveals more of the charm-covered wall to the left of the dragon head than was visible in the first frame.
