frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays two parallel train tracks extending into the distance, curving gently to the right, with dense green foliage bordering both sides. On the left, a multi-story building is partially visible behind the trees, while a dark utility pole stands on the right, mid-distance from the viewer. Catenary wires stretch overhead against a pale blue sky, with faint distant buildings just discernible beyond the tracks' curve.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the immediate surroundings on both sides, including the building on the left and the utility pole on the right, progressively recede and move out of the frame. Simultaneously, previously obscured buildings to the right, including one with a distinct green dome, become increasingly clear and closer. The dense foliage along the tracks continuously shifts past the viewer, revealing more of the landscape beyond as the train advances along the curving path.

Two parallel railway tracks, filled with gravel, extend from the bottom center into the mid-distance, curving gently to the left. Lush green trees and bushes line both sides of the tracks, with utility poles and overhead power lines visible overhead. In the background on the right, several buildings appear, including a prominent one with a green dome roof beside a dark-roofed structure, all under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint advances along the tracks, causing the utility pole on the right to move out of the frame. A bridge structure with white railings emerges further down the tracks, and a red signal light appears on the right track before it. Simultaneously, a multi-story red building becomes increasingly visible on the far left, while the green-domed building on the right remains in the distance.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows two sets of train tracks curving slightly to the right, extending into the distance from the viewer's perspective, flanked by gravel. To the immediate left, a reddish apartment building and a white guardrail are visible, while to the right, a similar guardrail, a red building, and a distant gray building with a green dome are present. Green trees and bushes line both sides of the tracks, with multiple overhead electrical wires traversing the blue-grey sky above.
end of description
As the train moves forward, the dark structures and white railings in the immediate foreground move past the viewer, revealing red graffiti on the right-hand structure. The buildings and dense foliage on both sides of the tracks recede from the original viewpoint, progressively exposing more of the curving tracks ahead and the distant cityscape. A yellow signal light becomes visible further down the tracks as the view opens up.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
Two train tracks extend directly in front of the viewer, curving left into the distance, flanked by green embankments with trees and foliage. Overhead wires traverse the pale blue sky, while a red-roofed building with a green-domed structure is visible to the right, and a yellow signal light shines ahead between the tracks. end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the tracks, the foreground foliage and initial buildings to the right recede and move out of frame. A new white multi-story building on the left becomes increasingly prominent behind the embankment foliage, and a fence appears on the right side. The overhead wires and utility poles continually move past, while the distant yellow signal remains ahead.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows two parallel train tracks on a gravel bed, curving slightly to the right into the distance, beneath a twilight blue sky. To the immediate left, a steep, green embankment features a distant white building with lit windows at the top and a yellow sign midway down the slope, while overhead electrical wires span across the frame. On the right, a lower, vegetated bank displays dense trees and bushes, with a reddish building partially visible at the far right edge.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, causing the white building and yellow sign on the left to recede and eventually exit the frame to the left, and the red building to exit right. Utility poles supporting the overhead wires enter from the sides and pass by as the scene advances. The track curve becomes more prominent, and new sections of track, including switches, along with changing vegetation on both embankments, are continuously revealed ahead.
