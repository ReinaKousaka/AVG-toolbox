A person holding a black umbrella is partially visible in the near foreground, moving right, alongside a black metal railing and a wet sidewalk. In the midground, a yellow van heads right and a white SUV left, with a central pole displaying a 'no entry' sign and red traffic lights, while pedestrians with umbrellas are further down the street.

Subsequently, the person and yellow van exit right, revealing two gray trash bins behind the railing and a white delivery truck with red accents emerging from the left. This delivery truck then exits right as a white compact car enters from the left, proceeding across the intersection and briefly obscuring the trash bins, while the leftmost traffic light cycles between red and yellow.

A rain-soaked urban intersection is viewed from a sidewalk on the right, revealing a white car turning left across a zebra crossing in the midground, surrounded by traffic poles, orange cones, and distant buildings under an overcast sky.
end of description
The white car proceeds further left across the intersection and exits the frame, during which the traffic light on the left changes from red to green, then yellow. Subsequently, a black car enters from the left side of the first-frame viewpoint, crosses the intersection rightward, and exits the frame to the right. Following this, a silver car appears further back on the left, moving in the same direction.
