In the first frame, a city street stretches into the background. To the left, a white utility truck with a tan tarp is parked. Two pedestrians are in the mid-ground; one in a dark coat with a light shoulder bag walks away from the viewer, left of center, while another in a dark coat and trousers walks from left to right across the street, near a vendor pushing a tall cart filled with items. On the right, a modern building with "ZARA" visible on its facade lines a wide pedestrian walkway, which connects to the main wet street. Numerous buildings with colorful signs and banners line both sides of the street leading into the distance, topped by an overcast sky and a distant blue skyscraper.
end of description
Over the subsequent frames, the pedestrian in the dark coat with the light bag continues walking away from the viewer, staying on the left side of the street. The second pedestrian in the dark coat and the vendor pushing the cart both proceed to move further right and away from the viewer, crossing the street towards the right sidewalk. Other distant pedestrians also show slight movement further down the street, while the truck and buildings remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
