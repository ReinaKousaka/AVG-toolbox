To the viewer's immediate left, an overhanging building structure with a "CHECK-IN GRIWARENT" sign partially covers the top left, with a large, grey rock on the paved sidewalk below it. A sidewalk extends forward on the left, leading to a green tree and lamppost, beyond which a lower landscaped area with people and a mountain valley is visible. To the right, a street runs alongside a row of traditional multi-story buildings with red shutters and balconies, where numerous people are strolling. In the distant background, mountains rise under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The viewpoint progressively moves forward along the paved sidewalk. The large rock and the "CHECK-IN GRIWARENT" sign on the left move out of the frame as the camera advances. The person in the blue jacket on the left sidewalk continues walking further away, revealing more of the sidewalk behind the initial position of the rock. The rows of buildings and the people on the right sidewalk are continuously passed, revealing new sections of the street and more distant pedestrians. The mountain scenery in the background remains largely visible, shifting in perspective as the viewer progresses down the street.
