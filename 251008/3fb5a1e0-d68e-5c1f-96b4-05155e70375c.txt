In the first frame, a clear blue sky with scattered clouds is overhead. A road stretches from the foreground into the background on the right, bordered by a sidewalk on the left, next to a low stone wall. On the left side, a patch of green grass holds a distinctive blue, curved object in the foreground, and behind it are numerous green trees, including a tall conifer, and part of a wooden building. Several traditional-style multi-story buildings with wooden balconies and awnings line the right side of the road, featuring outdoor seating with people. A pole rises vertically from the left of the stone wall.
end of description
A dark green SUV emerges from the mid-ground on the road, driving towards the viewer. It proceeds past the group of pedestrians on the sidewalk to the left, then continues to move past the viewer's immediate right, exiting the frame to the foreground. Simultaneously, the pedestrians on the sidewalk slowly advance further into the background.
