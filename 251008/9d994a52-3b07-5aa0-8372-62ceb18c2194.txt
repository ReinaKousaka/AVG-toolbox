The first frame displays a city sidewalk scene with a person in a dark coat and a grey backpack walking away from the viewer on the right. To the viewer's left, a building's glass entrance is visible, flanked by light-colored pillars and several vertical promotional signs, including a prominent red banner and a 'no cycling' symbol on the pavement, with a white vending machine at the far left. A wide pedestrian pavement with a yellow tactile strip extends forward, bordered on the right by a metal barrier and a bus stop shelter further down the street, while urban buildings and traffic occupy the distant background under a bright sky.

As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the sidewalk. The person with the backpack gradually moves further away, staying on the right side of the frame. The signs and vending machine previously on the left move out of view to the left, revealing more of the building's light-colored, reflective facade. Concurrently, the bus stop shelter and the metal barrier on the right side of the street become increasingly prominent as they draw closer to the viewer.

The first frame shows a pedestrian's view down a city sidewalk, with a person in a black coat and grey backpack walking away from the viewer on a red brick path with a yellow tactile strip. To the viewer's left is a building facade adorned with posters, and to the right is a covered bus stop shelter bordering a street with railings and distant buildings.

end of description
Subsequently, as the viewer advances, sections of the building's advertisement wall on the left continuously slide past the initial viewpoint, revealing new content. The person in the black coat and other pedestrians ahead move further away from the initial camera position, while the urban environment to the right, including the street and distant buildings, progressively unfolds closer to where the first frame was captured.

A person in a dark coat with a grey backpack walks away in the center-right foreground on a brick-paved sidewalk next to a black metal railing. To the left, another person in a black jacket and mask walks towards the viewer along a tactile strip beside a long building wall adorned with posters, while a dark arched canopy extends overhead to the right, revealing a street with distant buildings and vehicles.
end of description
The masked person on the left walks closer to the viewer, eventually passing into the immediate foreground left and moving out of frame. Concurrently, the person with the backpack in the center-right continues walking further away, receding into the midground. Distant vehicles on the street also exhibit slight movement, driving away to the right.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures a rear view of a person wearing a backpack, walking away from the viewer on a brick sidewalk. To the left, a building wall displays a large advertisement featuring a person holding a white phone, alongside horizontal vents, while to the right, a street with a green bus, red car, and white van is bordered by a metal railing and an overhead shelter.
end of description
As the frames advance, the viewer moves forward, causing the person with the backpack to appear further ahead. The advertisement on the left building wall gradually reveals more text, "XPERIA 5 IV 5G", and subsequent sections of the building's vented wall become visible to the left. Concurrently, a yellow sign under the overhead shelter on the right side of the sidewalk becomes more clearly visible as the viewer progresses.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows the viewer on a tiled sidewalk behind a person in a black coat with a backpack, walking away. To the left is a building with horizontal panels, and to the right is a bus stop shelter with a waiting person and a yellow sign, beyond which a street with vehicles and buildings lines the far side.
end of description
The person in the black coat and another person on the far left sidewalk continue walking away from the viewer. Throughout the frames, the person waiting to the right remains mostly stationary, while additional pedestrians become visible walking on the far sidewalk, and vehicles on the street further away change positions.
