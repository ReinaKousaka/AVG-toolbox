A man in a dark suit walks away from the viewer in a lavish marble bathroom, featuring a glass-fronted sauna on the far left and a glass-enclosed shower stall next to it, while a large window with draped curtains on the right overlooks a cityscape, and a white bathrobe hangs on the far right wall above a basket of towels.

The man continues walking forward, then stops beside the shower, turning to face it and reaching out to grasp its handle. As he stands, a marble vanity with wooden cabinets beneath it and several white objects on top is fully revealed to his right, previously partially obscured by him. Simultaneously, the view inside the sauna to the left clarifies, showing more of the cityscape reflection and items on its interior shelves.
