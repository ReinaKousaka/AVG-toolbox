The first frame presents a wet city street on the left, where a dark blue Tesla with illuminated headlights is stopped beside a lighter-colored car; a dark purple shoulder is visible in the immediate foreground left. To the right, a wet sidewalk extends past a building with a reflective glass canopy displaying "dollar." and "Thrifty" signs, leading towards outdoor cafe seating.
end of description
As the viewpoint gradually moves forward along the sidewalk, the foreground shoulder exits the frame to the left, and the stopped cars on the street are progressively passed. Simultaneously, additional "Hertz" and repeated "dollar." and "Thrifty" car rental signs emerge into view further down the right-hand building. Reflections on the right-side building dynamically shift, and the outdoor seating and pedestrians further along the sidewalk become slightly clearer.

The first frame shows a wet city sidewalk on the right, extending from the bottom towards the mid-distance. A dark pole stands vertically on the far left, bordering a wet asphalt street where a dark blue Tesla with illuminated headlights is parked or stopped directly in front of a white car, both to the left of the viewer. To the right, under a glass canopy, are signs for "Hertz," "dollar," and "Thrifty" above outdoor seating, fronting a building with reflective windows. In the background, tall urban buildings with many windows line the street under an overcast sky, with bare trees visible on the left side.

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint remains largely stationary. The signs for "Hertz," "dollar," and "Thrifty" on the right side of the frame gradually shift upwards, with the "Hertz" sign eventually moving out of the top-right view. Subtle changes occur in the reflections visible on the storefront windows to the right, while the cars and pole maintain their positions relative to the fixed viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a wet city street with a dark blue Tesla parked prominently on the left curb, its front facing away from the viewer, followed by a white car. To the right, a sidewalk borders a storefront with outdoor tables and chairs, while tall city buildings rise in the background under an overcast sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the dark blue Tesla's front left headlight illuminates brightly, and subtle water splashes become visible around its front left tire, indicating minor movement or activation on the street to the left of the viewer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a wet city street scene. In the immediate foreground to the left, a dark blue Tesla Model 3 is parked at the curb, facing away from the viewer, with its headlights illuminated and raindrops on its surface. To the right, a wide concrete sidewalk extends forward, featuring an outdoor cafe seating area with tables and chairs near a building with large windows and an A-frame sign. Further down the street, a white Tesla is parked, and a street pole stands between the road and sidewalk, with multiple city buildings and pedestrians visible in the distant background.
end of description.
Subsequently, the dark blue Tesla's windshield wipers activate, sweeping across its front glass. A blue SUV, initially further back on the street to the left, moves forward and passes the parked blue Tesla. The white Tesla parked ahead also shows a subtle change in its front lighting, suggesting minor movement further into the scene.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays an urban street scene with a wet pavement and sidewalk under an overcast sky. In the foreground to the left, a dark blue car is partially visible on the street, while a white car is parked further ahead in the midground. To the right, a sidewalk features a sandwich board sign closest to the viewer and two outdoor tables with chairs further along. A building with large glass windows and "Donburi" signage lines the right side, extending into the background, where more city buildings and distant vehicles are visible on the street.
end of description
The dark blue car on the left begins to slowly drive forward, progressively revealing more of its rear and the wet street behind it. The vehicle continues moving away from the viewer and slightly to the left, eventually exiting the frame from the bottom left corner. This dynamic reveals a previously obscured portion of the street and curb where the car was parked, while the white car and background elements remain relatively static from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, the viewer is on a city sidewalk looking down a street. To the immediate right, a building facade features large windows displaying baked goods and a sign for "Kita no Donburi," with outdoor tables and chairs on the sidewalk directly in front. To the left, a white Tesla Model 3 is parked parallel to the curb on the wet street, with tall buildings visible behind it. Further down the street in the midground, a utility pole stands, and pedestrians and other vehicles are visible in the distance.
end of description
The white Tesla Model 3, initially on the left side of the street, begins to slowly move forward and slightly into the lane, away from the viewer's original position. The car's front left wheel turns as it maneuvers, and its brake lights repeatedly illuminate and extinguish throughout its movement. A person becomes visible in the driver's seat of the Tesla as it progresses. Pedestrians and other distant vehicles continue their movement further down the street away from the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a street scene with a white Tesla parked on the left side of the road, facing away from the viewer. To the right, a sidewalk features two empty black cafe tables with chairs outside a building adorned with large windows and a glass overhang. A utility pole stands on the sidewalk in the midground, with a city street extending forward into the distance, revealing distant buildings and pedestrians.
end of description
Following this, the white Tesla slowly moves forward, exiting the frame to the left. Concurrently, various other vehicles appear and pass along the street in the midground, moving away from the viewer. Pedestrians continue walking further down the street, ahead and to the left, while a green illuminated sign on the building to the right subtly changes its displayed pattern. Red lights under the glass overhang on the right also show slight flickering.
