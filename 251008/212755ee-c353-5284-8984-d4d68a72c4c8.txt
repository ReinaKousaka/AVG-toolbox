In the first frame, a group of pedestrians, many holding black umbrellas, are crossing a wet street away from the viewer in the mid-ground. To the left foreground, a black SUV is stopped in a lane, with a red truck partially visible behind it. Tall city buildings line the left side, displaying an RBC sign and 'Staples', while skyscrapers stretch into an overcast sky in the background, with a white delivery van visible further down the street to the right.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the main group of pedestrians continues walking away from the viewer, moving further across the crosswalk. Simultaneously, the white delivery van in the mid-ground on the right edge advances slightly forward. The black SUV and red truck on the left remain stationary, allowing more of a blue sedan behind them to become visible as the central pedestrians clear the view.

The first frame displays a rainy city street with a wet asphalt road featuring white painted lines in the foreground. A dark car is partially visible on the far left, while a group of umbrella-carrying pedestrians walk away from the viewer across a midground crosswalk, with a dark blue sedan parked to their left. Further in the midground and background, a white delivery van is on the right, and tall city buildings with signs like 'Nutcracker' and 'Staples' line the street, under an overcast sky.
end of description
Over the subsequent frames, the pedestrians continue walking away from the viewer across the crosswalk, progressively moving further down the street. The dark blue sedan on the left begins to slowly advance forward, while a black car emerges from behind the white delivery van on the right, proceeding across the intersection. Simultaneously, other vehicles, including a yellow taxi, become more apparent in the midground and background, moving through the intersection.

The first frame captures a rainy city street with pedestrians, many holding umbrellas, crossing towards the viewer. A dark blue car is visible on the left foreground, while a dark sedan recedes on the right mid-ground. Buildings with a 'Nutcracker' poster and 'Staples' signs line the background-left, opposite modern skyscrapers and a 'W Georgia St' sign on the background-right. end of description. As frames progress, pedestrians move across the crosswalk, some exiting to the viewer's left and right. The dark blue car on the left advances, and a yellow taxi appears from the distant right, moving across the frame towards the viewer's right.

The first frame depicts a rainy city street with numerous pedestrians on a crosswalk in the midground, framed by buildings like Staples on the left and tall skyscrapers in the background. A yellow taxi and a white truck are also visible further down the street on the right.
end of description
As frames progress, pedestrians on the crosswalk move towards and away from the viewer; a woman in a dark hooded coat on the left advances closer, while a woman in a white coat on the right also approaches. Simultaneously, the white truck in the background on the right slowly moves forward.

The first frame presents a rainy city street with numerous pedestrians, many carrying umbrellas, crossing from the foreground into the mid-ground. A woman in a dark jacket occupies the far right foreground, while a person with a polka-dotted umbrella is centrally visible, both walking away from the viewer amidst tall buildings with prominent signs like "Staples Depot" on the left.
end of description
As the video progresses, the woman on the far right moves out of the frame, and the central pedestrian with the polka-dotted umbrella continues walking away from the viewer. Concurrently, a dark vehicle with headlights on appears in the mid-ground on the far right and drives further away from the viewer, while other pedestrians continue their movements across the street.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a wet city crosswalk where pedestrians, many holding umbrellas like the polka-dotted one centrally in the mid-foreground, are crossing a street flanked by buildings; prominent signs like 'Staples' are on the left, and distant high-rises are visible right.
end of description
Throughout subsequent frames, pedestrians steadily advance across the crosswalk; the man initially on the far mid-right moves further right, and a woman in a blue beanie holding a coffee cup emerges from the right mid-ground towards the viewer. Simultaneously, the overhead traffic light for vehicles ahead changes from green to yellow then red, while the pedestrian walk signal counts down from 8 to 1.

The first frame captures a rainy city street scene with numerous pedestrians. In the immediate foreground on the far right, a person in a dark coat and beanie holds a coffee cup, facing left. To their left, another person walks away from the viewer in a black puffer coat, carrying a white bag. Centrally, a person walks away, holding a black umbrella with white polka dots. On the left, a pole with multiple business signs (e.g., 'Business Depot,' 'Drugstore') stands next to a tall building, while another pole with banners and a green traffic light is on the right, surrounded by more pedestrians. The street and sidewalk are visibly wet, reflecting the overcast sky and surrounding urban buildings.
end of description
The person holding the coffee cup in the foreground moves left, gradually exiting the frame by the fourth image, while other pedestrians continue receding further down the street. A dark car enters the background street from the far right and drives left, then a white SUV follows a similar path, entering from the far right background and moving across the frame. A McDonald's sign becomes visible on the left side of the scene, behind the initial traffic light pole, as the camera subtly pans.
