The first frame depicts a wide paved sidewalk with a large tree trunk in the left foreground, partially obscuring the view beyond it. To its right, a blue and yellow recycling bin pair stands beside a building with a glass facade and mural on the far left, behind which a street with cars is visible. Along the right, smaller trees and concrete benches line a stone building, with a blue UBC sign centrally located in the mid-ground.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward and slightly to the right, revealing more of the scene. The prominent foreground tree and recycling bins recede and shift left relative to their initial positions, unveiling more of the street and building facade further left. Concurrently, a second blue UBC sign and additional concrete benches are revealed further down the right side of the sidewalk, beyond their first-frame counterparts.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a sunlit urban sidewalk looking down a tree-lined path. To the immediate left are yellow and black refuse bins and black metal bollards, bordering a street with parked cars and a planter of yellow flowers, beyond which is a modern glass building reflecting the sky. A row of bare-branched deciduous trees lines the center of the sidewalk, with a blue 'UBC Robson Square' sign positioned to their left. On the right, a classic stone building with arched windows features another blue sign and long concrete benches. Far in the distance, tall buildings and pedestrians are visible under a bright blue sky.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly progresses forward along the sidewalk, causing foreground objects to move out of the frame while distant ones appear closer. The "UBC Robson Square" sign, initially mid-left, shifts toward the center-left relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Shadows on the ground subtly shift to the left as the perspective advances. Pedestrians initially visible in the far distance move closer into the midground, approaching the viewer's original position. The two people sitting by the trees on the left remain visible, slowly shifting their position within the frame as the camera moves forward.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a large blue and gold sign for "UBC Robson Square" is positioned in the foreground-left, partially obscured by a bare tree trunk. To its right, a paved sidewalk stretches into the distance, lined with more bare trees, and features a concrete bench in the mid-ground where several people are seated. On the far left, a glass-facade building and a street with some yellow flowers are visible, while a large stone building stands to the far right. Tall urban buildings are visible in the background, beneath a blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward and slightly left, causing the "UBC Robson Square" sign to become less obscured and fully visible, revealing more text, as the foreground tree shifts further left. The seated people on the bench move out of the frame to the left, and a white car on the street becomes more apparent behind the sign. Concurrently, a second, smaller blue sign appears on the far right mid-ground as the distant buildings appear closer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a partial blue and gold sign for "University of British Columbia" and "son Square" is prominent in the foreground-left. To the right of the sign, two people are seated on a stone bench under bare-branched trees lining a wide sidewalk that stretches into the mid-ground. To the immediate left of the sidewalk is a street with parked cars and a modern building with glass facades, while in the background, tall city buildings pierce a blue sky. On the mid-ground-right, a grey, classical stone building with another blue sign is visible, with a low stone wall in the foreground-right.
end of description
The viewer moves forward and slightly right along the sidewalk. The blue and gold sign on the far left in the first frame gradually moves out of view to the left, revealing more of the street, parked cars, and a modern building with large glass windows. Concurrently, the grey, classical building on the right and the blue sign attached to it become more fully visible as the viewer approaches. The two people sitting on the bench in the mid-ground left remain in position, with the woman turning towards the man and appearing to eat something he gives her. The distant cityscape and pedestrians further down the sidewalk become progressively clearer as the viewpoint advances.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
A wide sidewalk stretches into the distance, flanked by bare-branched trees. To the viewer's immediate left, a woman in a plaid coat and a man in a dark jacket are seated on a concrete ledge, both looking down as the man eats. Across a street to the left, a modern glass-fronted building and parked cars are visible, while to the right, an old stone building with steps lines the sidewalk. In the background, city skyscrapers rise under a blue sky, and a few pedestrians walk further down the sidewalk away from the viewer.

end of description
The woman to the left stands up from the concrete ledge and exits the frame to the viewer's far left. The man remains seated on the ledge, continuing to eat, while pedestrians in the mid-ground proceed further down the sidewalk away from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame features a man seated on a low wall in the foreground left, eating a wrapped item, while four bare-branched trees frame a paved sidewalk stretching into the distance. To the left, a street with parked cars runs alongside a large modern building with a glass facade, contrasting with the classical stone building occupying the right side. Beyond, the urban scene includes multiple tall buildings and two pedestrians walking away on the central sidewalk.
end of description
In the following frames, the man in the foreground progressively exits the scene to the left of the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the two pedestrians on the central sidewalk continue to move further away from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a city street with a sidewalk in the foreground, flanked by a modern glass building and parked cars to the left, and an older stone building to the right; two bare trees stand on the sidewalk, with pedestrians walking away into the distance towards skyscrapers under a blue sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the viewer's position remains static while the two pedestrians on the central sidewalk continue to walk further away into the distance, moving deeper into the scene from the first-frame viewpoint. Additional pedestrians further in the background also progress along the street in the same direction.
