The first frame displays a graffiti-covered urban wall; a central grey metal door features a black Mickey Mouse silhouette in red shorts and yellow shoes, holding a spray can. To its left, a pink-framed glass door is set in a light grey brick wall with dark graffiti, reflecting interior elements. On the right, a black brick wall is extensively covered in vibrant green, blue, and pink abstract graffiti.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts right, revealing more of the pink-framed glass door on the left side of the original view. A "BUSINESS HOURS" sign and a white bowl logo inside the glass door become clearer and more visible on the expanded left side. Consequently, the vibrant graffiti on the far right of the initial frame gradually moves slightly out of view.
