The first frame depicts a wet urban street leading away from the viewer, under an overcast sky. In the foreground, a damp asphalt road with two parallel yellow lines features a white "30" speed limit marking in the center, and a dark trash can rests on the sidewalk to the immediate right. Along the left side of the street, a row of parked cars (including black and white sedans) extends into the distance, paralleled by building facades adorned with various signs. On the right, a red barrier with posters runs alongside the sidewalk, behind which a person is visible further down, interacting with a counter setup. Tall buildings dominate the background, closing off the distant street view.

The light-colored car in the mid-distance steadily moves further away from the viewer, progressing down the wet street. Simultaneously, the person behind the counter on the right side of the street exhibits slight movements, indicating continued activity.

The first frame shows a wet city street on a rainy day. In the foreground, the asphalt road displays a white '30' speed limit marking and yellow lane lines. To the left, a row of parked cars (black, white, silver) lines the street alongside buildings with storefronts and Korean signage. On the right, more storefronts with awnings and outdoor areas are visible, along with dark trash bins partially obscured by a yellow 'Kelly' banner. A light-colored car is driving away in the far background, where taller buildings rise under a hazy sky.
end of description
The light-colored car in the far background gradually recedes further down the street. A person holding a green umbrella emerges from the mid-background on the right side of the road and walks towards the viewer. Simultaneously, the trash bins on the far right move mostly out of frame, and a person seated in the right mid-ground outdoor area stands up and shifts their position. The person with the umbrella continues to approach the viewer, becoming more prominent in the mid-ground.

The first frame displays a wet city street on a rainy day, with a '30' speed limit painted in the foreground and yellow lines defining a central lane. Parked white cars line the left side, facing away from the viewer, while buildings with various signs rise on both sides; to the right, an outdoor eating area with stacked crates features a person seated under an umbrella, and a pedestrian with a green umbrella walks in the street towards distant, hazy buildings. end of description
The pedestrian holding the green umbrella slowly walks further down the wet street, away from the viewer's initial position. The person seated on the right adjusts their umbrella, and the continuous rain causes subtle changes in reflections and visible streaks across the scene.
