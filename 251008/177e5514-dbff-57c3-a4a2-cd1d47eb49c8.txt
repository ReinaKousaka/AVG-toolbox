A narrow, wet asphalt street extends forward from the viewer, bordered by concrete sidewalks. On the immediate left is a white building with a red awning and windows, some featuring a grid, while further down are more traditional dark-roofed structures and a distant red post. To the immediate right, a dark urn and a potted plant are on the sidewalk, followed by a dark fence and a white building with a wooden section and dark roof. Utility lines and a pole are visible overhead against an overcast sky, framing the path ahead.
end of description
The subsequent frames depict a very slow forward movement along the street. As the viewpoint advances, objects originally close to the viewer's immediate right in the first frame, such as the dark urn, progressively move further right and out of visibility from the first-frame's perspective. Simultaneously, the grid-covered window on the left building also shifts further left from the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, structures and the street sections that were previously in the mid-ground and background, directly ahead of the first-frame viewpoint, become gradually closer and more prominent as the camera approaches them.

The first frame depicts a wet, narrow Japanese street receding into the distance, flanked by traditional buildings under an overcast sky. On the left, a white-topped building with a dark lower section and a red awning is visible, while on the right, a white building with a brown facade features a black railing and a red velvet rope barrier in the immediate foreground.
end of description
Subsequent frames show a slow, continuous zoom-out, gradually revealing more of the immediate foreground on both sides of the street. This includes additional sections of the building facades and the wet pavement directly in front of the viewer, effectively widening the visible scene.

The first frame depicts a narrow, wet paved street extending away from the viewer under an overcast sky, flanked by buildings. To the left, a traditional dark-wood building with horizontal slats, signs, and pink hanging decorations occupies the foreground and midground. To the right, a white building with a wooden upper facade features a black railing adorned with bamboo poles and yellow tags, along with a prominent black and white sign near the viewer. In the distant background, more traditional buildings are visible, and red traffic cones mark an intersection.
end of description
A white van with a yellow roof section appears from the right in the midground, moving away from the viewer down the wet street. It continues its progression towards the distant intersection, passing the white building on the right where a red 'KIRIN' sign becomes visible. The van then proceeds past the intersection, disappearing entirely from the frame.
