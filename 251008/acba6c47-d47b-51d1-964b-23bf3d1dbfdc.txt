From a low viewpoint on the right edge of a paved path, the scene unfolds towards a curving road flanked by lush green trees on the left. To the immediate right, a dark pole with yellow signs partially obscures some green foliage and a curb, beyond which lies a parking lot with various cars (white, dark grey, silver). Dominating the mid-distance right is a large cable-stayed bridge featuring a concrete pylon and red suspension cables, spanning above a multi-level road structure, all set against a blue sky with scattered clouds.

end of description

As the viewer moves forward, the pole on the immediate right gradually disappears from view. A cyclist appears from the left midground, steadily approaching along the curving road ahead. Yellow painted bicycle and pedestrian symbols sequentially become visible on the paved path directly in front of the viewer, marking a designated lane as the camera advances. The cyclist on the left draws closer, eventually moving past the first-frame's position.
