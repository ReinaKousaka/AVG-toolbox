The first frame depicts a winter mountain valley scene, with a cleared road curving slightly forward under a pale blue sky. To the left, a traditional multi-story building with parked cars sits beneath a towering, sunlit mountain, while a snow-dusted forest and another large mountain line the right side of the road, all leading towards distant snow-capped peaks.

As the camera progresses forward along the road, the building and cars on the left recede behind the viewpoint, and a line of orange traffic cones appears ahead on the left, which the camera then passes. The scene continuously shifts as the viewer moves deeper into the valley, with the distant mountains remaining centered.

The first frame shows a snow-covered mountain valley with a road extending directly from the viewer into the distance. To the immediate left, a traditional wooden house is partially visible, with a tall, snow-dusted mountain behind it. On the right, bare trees and a snow-covered embankment line the road, backed by another large mountain. In the midground, bare trees are clustered along the road's curve, with distant snow-capped peaks in the far background.

As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the snowy road. The house on the left recedes from view, revealing more of the snow-laden landscape and a series of white and red traffic cones lining the road on the left. A large billboard structure, initially partially hidden by trees to the left of the road, gradually comes into full view. This billboard, displaying images and text, becomes increasingly prominent and detailed as the viewpoint approaches it, revealing "TRUMMELBACHFÃ„LLE" written across its panels. The bare trees lining both sides of the road also appear to advance towards the viewer, becoming larger and more defined. The majestic mountains on either side remain as a dominant backdrop, their details shifting slightly with the change in perspective.
