The first frame shows a light blue pleated curtain with a subtle pattern and a golden border, occupying most of the right and center foreground. To the left, a window reveals an outdoor scene with green foliage, a tree trunk, and blurred structures beyond; a glimpse of a dark object and a pale, pleated lampshade is visible behind the curtain on the far right.

As the frames progress, the curtain dynamically slides further to the left, gradually revealing more of a dark red lamp base situated behind the curtain on a dark surface to the right of the first-frame viewpoint.
