The first frame displays a nighttime scene of a canal city. To the left, a dark canal reflects warm and blue lights, flowing towards an arched stone bridge illuminated with striking blue light underneath, with traditional buildings lining its banks, some adorned with white decorative lights. In the foreground left, several bicycles, one partially covered in white fabric, are parked along a low stone barrier next to the canal. To the right, a paved sidewalk features parked motorbikes/scooters and leads to more buildings where a few people are visible further back. Centered mid-ground, a streetlamp with two glowing orange lanterns hangs above a traditional wooden structure near the bridge's base.
end of description
Starting from the fourth frame, the canal's water level steadily rises, progressively covering more of the stone barrier in the foreground left and moistening the bicycle's white cover. This rising water noticeably expands and intensifies the reflections of the surrounding lights on the water's surface. The other elements of the scene, including the buildings and people to the right, remain fixed in their positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
