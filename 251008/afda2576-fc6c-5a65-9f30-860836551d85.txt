The first frame displays a street scene looking down a paved road lined with buildings featuring traditional architecture on both sides. In the immediate foreground, a white sedan is partially visible on the far left, and another white sedan occupies the far right. On the left, a tall evergreen tree stands beside the road, in front of a building with red and yellow balconies. On the right, a darker wooden building with red details also features balconies and hangs red banners. Further down the road on the right, a dark brown SUV is parked, while a white car is visible driving towards the viewer in the distance, near a visible crosswalk and traffic lights suspended overhead. Behind the distant buildings, a mountain range is visible beneath a cloudy sky.

As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the street. The foreground white cars and the evergreen tree move out of the frame to the left and right, respectively. The parked brown SUV and the building on the right become closer, revealing a silver pickup truck parked behind the SUV. On the left, more of the building facade and an additional lamppost with red flags are revealed, and pedestrians appear on the sidewalk walking towards the viewer. The traffic lights above the road also become noticeably closer and larger.

In the first frame, a street with a pedestrian crosswalk extends away from the viewer. To the viewer's immediate right, the front-right portion of a dark brown SUV is visible, with a light grey pickup truck parked behind it, facing away. On the viewer's left, a green evergreen tree partially obscures a sidewalk, where a person in a dark jacket stands facing the street. Further down the street, buildings with traditional architecture, adorned with Chinese flags, line both sides, punctuated by ornate lampposts and suspended traffic lights. A mountain covered with trees rises in the background behind the buildings on the left, beneath a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint gradually shifts forward and slightly to the right relative to the first-frame position, the brown SUV on the right moves out of frame, and the grey pickup truck drives forward before also exiting the frame. The person on the left sidewalk walks further ahead, and the evergreen tree initially on the far left recedes from view. Concurrently, the white van on the right advances forward, revealing more of the intersection and the architectural details of the buildings lining the street ahead.

The first frame presents a street view of an intersection in a town, featuring a white crosswalk directly in front of the viewer. To the immediate right, a white SUV is parked, while a red lamppost with a Chinese flag stands on the far left. A multi-story building with red decorative trim and large windows occupies the right midground, and a lighter-colored building with a blue sign is on the left midground. Green mountains form the backdrop behind the buildings, under a cloudy sky. A pedestrian is visible on the left sidewalk walking away, and another person stands near a brown car on the left side of the intersection, with other vehicles in the distance.
end of description
Following frames show the white SUV in the right foreground slowly moving forward and exiting the frame to the right. Concurrently, the person on the left sidewalk continues walking away from the viewer and to the left, eventually exiting the frame entirely. The person standing near the brown car on the left also shifts slightly left, while other vehicles further down the road advance slowly.

The first frame displays a street intersection under a partly cloudy sky, flanked by buildings in a traditional style. To the viewer's left, a two-story building with a blue sign stands next to a brown parked car, with two pedestrians walking towards the left foreground. On the right, a prominent three-story building with red and gold decorations and large windows defines the corner, with traffic lights positioned on its facade, and a street extends into the distance between these structures, leading to visible mountains in the background.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the two pedestrians on the left continue walking further left and slightly away from the initial viewpoint, crossing the street. Simultaneously, the distant black sedan and silver van in the center of the street gradually move further away, deeper into the scene. All buildings, traffic lights, and the mountainous backdrop remain static relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame presents a street view of an intersection, with a paved road and crosswalk in the foreground, extending towards distant green mountains under a cloudy sky. On the left, a multi-story building with a traditional-style roof and a blue sign is visible, along with two pedestrians walking leftward on the sidewalk. To the right, a prominent modern building featuring red-patterned walls, large windows, and traffic lights at its corner dominates the scene. Two cars, a dark sedan and a silver van, are visible on the road ahead, positioned left-of-center and right-of-center respectively.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the two pedestrians on the left continue their walk, moving further left along the sidewalk and eventually out of the frame. Simultaneously, the dark sedan on the left lane and the silver van on the right lane both slowly advance forward towards the background.
