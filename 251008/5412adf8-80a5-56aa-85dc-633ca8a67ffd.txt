In the first frame, two individuals are seen from behind in the foreground, with a person in a plaid shirt on the left and another in a floral dress and hat on the right. Directly ahead in the mid-ground, a large, ornate temple building with a grey stone base and green-tiled roof dominates, featuring red pillars, green trim, and partially open doors, with two stone lanterns flanking its central stairs. A person in white is ascending these stairs towards the temple, while a smaller building with a green roof is partially visible to the far left of the main temple. The ground beneath them is a light-colored, open area.
end of description
The camera subtly pans to the right and slightly recedes, causing objects to appear relatively smaller within the widening frame. The person initially ascending the stairs in the mid-ground moves further up and eventually enters the main temple building's interior, still directly ahead of the viewer's original position. Concurrently, the building with the green roof, initially partially visible to the far left of the main temple, becomes more fully revealed, exposing its yellow facade further to the left of its original visible portion.
