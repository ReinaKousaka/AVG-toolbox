The first frame displays a white kitchen cabinet with three glass-front doors, positioned centrally and vertically filling the view above the viewer's eye level. Inside the left section, clear glassware and purple items are on the top shelf, yellow glasses on the middle, and pink plates with a golden pitcher on the bottom. The middle section contains light bowls on top, pink plates in the middle, and a pink and white tureen with smaller dishes below. The right section holds light dishes on top, ornate pink plates in the middle, and stacks of pink and white teacups and saucers on the bottom.

The view slowly pans downwards, progressively revealing the area directly below the cabinet. A dark tiled backsplash becomes visible, followed by a light-colored countertop beneath it. On the countertop, a large framed abstract artwork appears centrally, flanked by stacked books on the left. A smaller framed picture is then revealed next to the books, and eventually, a small purple floral arrangement on the far left and a grey vase holding a cluster of pink flowers on the far right of the countertop complete the scene.
