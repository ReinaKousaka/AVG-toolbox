The first frame captures a vibrant night scene in a city, featuring numerous pedestrians walking on a brightly lit pavement in the foreground and midground on the left. To the right, people are seated along a low, plant-filled barrier, in front of a large building facade that displays illuminated luxury brand advertisements for Cartier, Piaget, and Panerai. In the background, several tall, illuminated skyscrapers rise against the dark sky, with one prominent building featuring a bank logo and another showing a multi-colored dome.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts rightward, progressively revealing more of the building on the right side. A "Rolex" storefront, initially partially obscured, becomes fully visible, along with a large advertisement of a silver watch above it. This rightward pan also introduces new individuals entering the frame from the far right, while people on the left foreground continue walking, maintaining the bustling atmosphere.
