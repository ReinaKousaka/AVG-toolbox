The foreground shows a light-colored ground covered in yellow leaves. A traditional Japanese wooden fence with a tiled roof stretches across the midground from left to right, partially obscuring a building behind it on the left. To the far left, a large, dark-roofed building is partially visible, while in the background center stands a massive tree with brilliant yellow leaves. On the right, a vibrant red torii gate stands tall, with a smaller red gate partially open behind its right pillar, all under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The scene remains static until a person gradually enters the frame from the far right. They position themselves to the right of the red torii gate, slightly further back in the scene than the gate itself. The person faces away from the viewer, raising their arms as if taking a photograph of the temple grounds.
