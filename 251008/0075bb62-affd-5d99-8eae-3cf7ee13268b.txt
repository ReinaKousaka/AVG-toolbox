The first frame displays an urban street scene on a sunny day, with a dark gray SUV in the immediate foreground, driving towards the viewer on the right lane of a multi-lane road. To the viewer's left, a tree-lined sidewalk runs alongside the road, with older buildings visible further in the distance, while a light-colored, multi-story building and several tall glass skyscrapers are prominent in the midground and background, respectively, to the right of the road.

As the frames progress, the initial dark gray SUV moves past the viewer to the left, exiting the frame, and the white SUV previously seen on the right also moves further away. A different dark-colored SUV subsequently appears in the midground on the right lane, approaching the first-frame viewpoint, and a new white SUV drives away in the rightmost lane. Throughout the sequence, various other vehicles are continuously seen moving away from the viewer in the left lanes of the road.

In the first frame, a wide road occupies the right and central foreground, with a black car in its middle lane and a white car further down the right lane, both heading away from the distant intersection. To the immediate left is a paved sidewalk bordered by a green hedge and a row of dark-leaved trees casting shadows. In the midground, an intersection with traffic lights is visible, beyond which stand several buildings, including a prominent beige building with many windows to the right of the road and a tall, reflective glass skyscraper further right in the background.

A black sedan, initially in the middle lane, moves from the midground towards and then past the viewer's right. Simultaneously, a white car in the right lane approaches from the midground, revealing itself as a white Volkswagen Golf Variant as it passes the first-frame viewpoint. A black SUV, initially visible in the distant midground, continuously progresses closer in the middle lane, eventually passing the viewer to the right. As this black SUV moves past, a second black Mercedes sedan becomes clearly visible further behind it in the right lane, also approaching the first-frame viewpoint.
