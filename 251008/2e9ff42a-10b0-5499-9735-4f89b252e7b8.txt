The first frame presents a straight road under a partly cloudy blue sky. In the foreground, the road occupies the center, with a manhole cover visible on its left edge. To the left, a landscaped median features lush greenery and several tall palm trees, behind which buildings are partially visible. To the right, parked cars—a silver SUV closest, followed by a red and a dark vehicle—line the street in front of a row of single-story commercial buildings, displaying signs like "MBS" and "THE WORLD". Further down the road, on both sides, more palm trees and distant buildings are seen, with a large construction crane prominent on the right horizon and a street pole bearing a pink banner advertising "Future".
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the road, initial foreground elements like white lines and a manhole cover move past the viewer's original position. On the right, the parked red car is gradually replaced by a white sedan, then a dark Mini Cooper, and another dark vehicle, all appearing sequentially further down the road from the first frame's silver SUV. Simultaneously, the "ONE LANE LEFT TURNS" sign on the left becomes fully clear before moving past the original viewpoint, while new 'LEFT TURN ONLY' road markings emerge in front of and beneath the viewer. Throughout this motion, the buildings and distant crane on both sides of the street appear to draw closer and shift towards the viewer's rear.

In the first frame, a multi-lane road stretches directly ahead, marked by white lines. To the viewer's left, a grassy median with foliage and palm trees separates the road from a sidewalk and multi-story buildings, including a white van parked near the curb. On the immediate right, a silver SUV is parked alongside a storefront, with a tall palm tree and another building further down the street. The background features a blue sky with scattered white clouds, taller buildings, and a construction crane in the distance.

end of description

The viewpoint steadily moves forward towards the intersection. The 'LEFT TURN ONLY' arrow on the road on the left shifts towards the bottom-left of the frame, and a "NO RIGHT TURN" sign becomes clearer on the left side. The white van on the far left moves out of view behind the viewer, while a silver SUV emerges from behind the left median, followed by a scooter appearing from the left and crossing the intersection directly in front of the viewer. Concurrently, a pink banner on a building to the right becomes more prominent, and other vehicles are seen driving through the intersection.

The first frame depicts a sunny urban street scene looking forward down a multi-lane road. In the foreground is an asphalt road with white markings and a crosswalk; a silver SUV is partially visible to the left and a silver car to the right. To the left, a multi-story building, a gas station, and a scooter with a rider are visible, while to the right, palm trees and a building with a pink banner stand. In the distance, beneath a blue sky with white clouds, several high-rise buildings, one under construction with a crane, punctuate the horizon.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward over the crosswalk, the silver SUV on the left and the silver car on the right continue moving forward out of frame. Subsequently, a white pickup truck enters the intersection from the mid-left and proceeds straight ahead as the traffic lights, initially red, turn green.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
From the viewer's position on a multi-lane road, a white SUV is stopped at a crosswalk to the immediate left, with a gas station building partially visible behind it. Overhead, a traffic light pole with three green lights and a "Bay Drive E" sign crosses the road, while various buildings, including one under construction with a crane, and palm trees line the road further ahead on both sides.
end of description
The viewer's vehicle moves forward as the white SUV on the left proceeds, eventually exiting the frame to the left of its original position. Subsequently, a grey car and then a black SUV emerge from behind the initial white SUV's original position, advancing forward in the left lane. The overhead traffic light pole and the crosswalk progressively recede upwards and out of the initial view, revealing more of the double yellow road lines ahead.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a wide multi-lane road stretching into the distance under a partly cloudy blue sky. On the left, a dark SUV is parked near a sidewalk bordered by palm trees, behind which stands a large white building with balconies and a tall construction site with a crane further back. A dark blue BMW SUV is visible in the left-center lane, followed by a lighter grey sedan further ahead, both moving away from the viewer, while the word 'ONLY' is painted on the road in the immediate foreground. The right side of the road features a green barrier, streetlights, and distant buildings, typical of an urban setting.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the dark blue BMW SUV on the left-center lane passes to the viewer's left, followed by a light grey sedan that also moves past. Simultaneously, a silver hatchback emerges from the far left and overtakes the viewpoint, becoming the closest vehicle on the left. The initial dark SUV and the "ONLY" road marking recede out of view as the foreground shifts, and a motorcycle appears further down the road ahead of the viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a multi-lane road extending into the distance from the viewer's position. To the viewer's left, a large, light-colored apartment building with balconies stands prominently, with a motorcycle in the adjacent left lane. In the mid-distance, a tall building under construction with a crane is visible slightly left of center, and various cars are on the road moving away from the viewer. To the viewer's right, a street lamp post is visible, with trees and other buildings lining the road further ahead. The sky above is blue with scattered white clouds.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the motorcycle on the left lane moves forward, receding from the viewer, while other cars in the mid-distance also proceed further down the road. A dark SUV then appears in the left lane, moving towards and eventually passing the viewer from left to right. Following this, a grey SUV enters the frame from the left, also moving past the viewer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A multi-lane road extends forward from the viewer, with a gray SUV parked to the immediate left. Further left stands a multi-story building with balconies, while another multi-story building is visible to the right beyond a low barrier. In the mid-distance on the left, a tall building under construction with a crane rises amongst palm trees, with a city skyline receding into the background. Overhead, a bright blue sky is adorned with numerous white clouds.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the gray SUV on the left recedes and exits the frame to the viewer's left. A black sedan, then a black SUV, emerge from the distance in the left lane, driving towards and then past the original viewpoint. Simultaneously, a street lamp becomes clearly visible on the left, and a couple of pedestrians appear on the right sidewalk, approaching the initial viewpoint.
