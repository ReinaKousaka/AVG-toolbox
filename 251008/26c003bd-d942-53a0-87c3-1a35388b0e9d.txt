The first frame captures a rainy night street scene, with the rear left section of a white pickup truck visible in the immediate foreground. The wet street, featuring a prominent red-painted section with a white '20' speed limit marking, extends into the mid-ground. To the left, a building with multiple white garage doors rises, leading to a dark, uphill street in the distance, while to the right, green foliage lines the path, obscured by the heavy rainfall under the glow of streetlights and distant bright building lights.

Following frames reveal a significant and rapid increase in water accumulation across the street, especially on the right side. A visible current of rainwater begins to flow from the right, across the red-painted road, and towards the left. This water flow intensifies and covers more of the road surface, partially obscuring the '20' marking, as the heavy rain continues to fall consistently throughout the scene.

The first frame displays a dark, rainy street scene at night, with heavy rainfall visibly streaks across the image. To the viewer's left, a building features a white garage door, while the center is dominated by a wet asphalt road curving uphill into the distance. A red-orange painted curb occupies the immediate foreground to the right, adjacent to illuminated buildings and poles further along the right side.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the rain's intensity causes a significant increase in water accumulation and flow on the ground. Initially, a gentle ripple forms on the red-orange curb to the viewer's right, progressively transforming into a visible sheet of water. This sheet then streams vigorously across the foreground, moving from the right side towards the center of the wet asphalt road.

The first frame captures a dark, rainy city street at night. To the viewer's left, a stone-faced building with a large white garage door and a rectangular window above it stands, with a green potted plant near its base and a black electric scooter lying on its side on the wet pavement. The street, marked with a white "30" and a yellow line on the right, slants uphill into the midground, illuminated by a streetlamp on the left and lined by buildings and trees. On the right, a concrete building features a brightly lit commercial sign and three red pipes below it, with an entrance to a lower level further right.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the primary dynamic element is the continuous heavy rainfall, visible as numerous streaks cascading down across the entire scene. These rain streaks constantly change in density and angle, creating shifting reflections and shimmering patterns on the extensively wet street and pavements. The ambient light from the streetlamp and building signs also subtly flickers and diffuses due to the intense precipitation.
