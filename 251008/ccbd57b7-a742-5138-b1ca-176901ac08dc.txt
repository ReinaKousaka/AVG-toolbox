The first frame captures a rainy street scene with a blue bus, its rear visible, moving away to the right on a wet road. In the foreground, a tree trunk is on the left, and a black metal fence runs parallel to the viewer, separating the road from a wet sidewalk on the right where a red scooter and a person with an umbrella are seen further down the street, with buildings visible in the background.
end of description
The blue bus continues to move further away to the right, gradually revealing more of the wet road and the distant buildings lining the street on the left. Throughout the frames, the heavy rainfall persists as the bus recedes and eventually disappears into the distance, with the viewpoint remaining fixed from the initial frame.
