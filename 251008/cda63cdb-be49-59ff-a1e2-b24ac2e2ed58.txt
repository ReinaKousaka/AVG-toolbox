The first frame depicts a snow-dusted urban park on an overcast day. In the immediate foreground, snow covers the ground, revealing patches of dark paving, and the edge of a low wall or planter is visible at the bottom. Slightly further back, two snow-covered park benches are positioned centrally, one to the left and one to the right, facing a circular paved area. At the center of this paved area stands a stone fountain or monument, surrounded by bare trees with snow on their branches. Lampposts are visible to the left and right of the central area. In the background, several buildings rise, including a white building with a colorful mural on the far left, a reddish-brown brick building directly behind the trees, and another large brick building on the right, with modern glass structures visible further back.
