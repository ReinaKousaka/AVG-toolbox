In the first frame, a man in a black jacket occupies the right foreground, facing the viewer. To his immediate right and slightly behind him are two women. In the mid-ground, to the left of the man, stands a large crowd of people behind two red kiosk-like structures advertising 'CHICAGO' and 'MJ THE MUSICAL'. To the far left, a stack of blue rectangular containers is visible. The background is dominated by numerous brightly illuminated billboards and building facades, including 'Swarovski', 'Sunglass Hut', 'I <3 NY', and 'Oakley', with a blue tarp partially covering a building to the far right.
end of description
Chronologically, the man in the black jacket moves to the right and exits the frame, followed by the two women originally to his right. A new person, a man in a dark jacket, then enters the frame from the right, walking leftward across the space where the first man stood. Concurrently, the camera subtly pans slightly right and zooms out, making the blue containers on the left appear smaller and revealing more of the street to the right. The crowd and the red kiosk-like structures in the mid-ground remain largely in their first-frame positions relative to the scene.
