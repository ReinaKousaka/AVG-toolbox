A prominent light-colored carving, resembling a Buddha statue, gradually becomes visible on the right mountain face, previously obscured. The yellow building on the left moves closer into view, revealing more of its lower levels as the scene progresses past its initial position.

To the left, a red truck is parked beside a yellow multi-story building, backed by a green mountain slope, while to the right, an elaborate golden railing borders a steep, rocky mountain face. A white car drives away in the center lane towards distant mountains under a blue, cloudy sky. end of description. The camera moves forward along the road, causing the white car to proceed further away. The red truck, yellow building, and the nearest streetlights and railing on both sides progressively move past the viewer and out of frame as new sections of the road and additional streetlights come into view ahead.
