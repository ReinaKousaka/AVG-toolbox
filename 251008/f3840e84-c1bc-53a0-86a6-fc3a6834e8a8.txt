In the first frame, a black A-frame sign with "Halal Low Food" and various food images is positioned in the bottom left, directly in front of the viewer. To the right, a building with brightly lit display windows, featuring "AIRMAX" branding and items like Adidas sneakers on a yellow background, lines the sidewalk. On the left, a wet city street extends into the distance, occupied by a white SUV and other vehicles, while pedestrians with umbrellas are gathered near a building entrance marked "KNICKERBOCKER" further down the street. Tall, hazy buildings form the background under a rainy sky.

Following frames show the A-frame sign in the foreground gradually moving out of view to the bottom left. The viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly left, revealing more of the street and less of the right-side building's lower portion. Cars, including the white SUV, continue to move away from the viewer further down the road, while additional vehicles enter the scene from the left. Pedestrians on the sidewalk also exhibit subtle movement. The reflections on the wet pavement dynamically change with the moving traffic and shifting perspective.

The first frame depicts a wet city street and sidewalk during heavy rain. To the viewer's right, a building showcases glowing yellow-green display windows with mannequins; to the left, a black SUV and a white SUV are driving away on the slick road, reflecting city lights and distant, mist-obscured skyscrapers. Ahead, pedestrians with umbrellas move near a building entrance marked "KNICKERBOCKER."
end of description
Chronologically, the black and white SUVs on the street to the left of the viewer continuously move further away, generating significant water spray from the increasingly wet asphalt. Pedestrians ahead on the sidewalk maintain their slow movement as the rain appears to intensify slightly.

The first frame presents a rainy city street, its wet surface reflecting ambient lights, extending into a misty distance lined by tall buildings. To the viewer's right, a building with glowing yellow display windows, including "AIRMAX" and "KNICKERBOCKER" signs, borders a sidewalk where pedestrians with umbrellas walk; on the street, a white SUV and dark cars recede away.
end of description
Subsequently, the cars on the street continue moving further into the distance, while pedestrians, some with red umbrellas, steadily approach and pass the viewer on the right sidewalk. Simultaneously, a blue and white bus progressively enters the scene from the far left foreground.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures a rainy city street with a partially visible blue and white bus on the far left. A white SUV is positioned on the wet asphalt street, facing away from the viewer, while pedestrians with umbrellas walk along the right sidewalk past storefronts including "AIRMAX" and "KNICKERBOCKER," all set against a backdrop of tall, misty buildings.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the blue and white bus on the far left slowly moves forward, revealing more of its side. Concurrently, the white SUV in the middle of the street also advances, moving further away from the viewer. Pedestrians on the right sidewalk continue walking, with the individual in the red coat progressing further down the street.
