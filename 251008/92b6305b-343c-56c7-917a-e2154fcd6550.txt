The first frame shows a paved street or walkway made of grey and darker grey blocks extending from the viewer into the distance. To the viewer's left is a red brick building housing the "Old English Pub," with illuminated windows showcasing interior details. Further right, another red brick building, decorated with festive lights, stretches into the background. Two individuals, one in a dark coat and one in a red coat, are walking away from the viewer on the paved street. A tall blue pole with a white flag-like extension stands in the midground, with other similar poles visible further down the street towards a large, multi-story modern building with many windows and signs in the distant background, next to which a decorated tree stands.
end of description
The two individuals continue walking away from the viewer, moving further into the background and slightly towards the right side of the paved street. They gradually become smaller as they progress down the street, relative to the stationary buildings and street furniture.
