The first frame displays a vibrant street corner with a group of pedestrians in the foreground walking rightward on a sidewalk; this group includes a person in a red hoodie and a man with a child holding a pink bag, all positioned between a building with a grated facade to the right and a street intersection with a "ONE WAY" sign and traffic lights to the left. Beyond them, a utility pole, planters, and architectural structures are visible in the midground, with distant buildings under a clear sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the foreground pedestrians continue their rightward movement, passing the initial viewpoint, with the man and child now eating ice cream cones, and a small black and white dog briefly appearing alongside the red-hooded figure. The "NO LOITERING" sign on the building to the right becomes more prominent, and a white car drives past in the midground street, as the individuals exit the frame, revealing two people standing with a cart further back in the midground.

The first frame shows an outdoor street scene with a clear blue sky. To the immediate right, a tall, perforated metal screen extends vertically. A sidewalk stretches from the foreground to the midground, running parallel to a street with visible tram tracks. On the left side of the sidewalk, a man in a dark suit stands next to a display stand with pamphlets, partially obscuring a woman in a red jacket to his left. Further left, a large fluted planter with greenery and a traffic light pole are visible. Across the street in the background, various buildings, including one with a prominent circular clock-like facade, are interspersed with trees, and a white car is seen moving left on the street.

end of description
The white car on the street moves further left and out of view across the subsequent frames. Two new individuals emerge from the distant right on the sidewalk, walking towards the viewer. They continue moving left past the utility boxes and towards the foreground. Concurrently, a black sedan appears on the street from the right, moving left behind the standing individuals and utility boxes. This sedan proceeds to drive past the midground, while a white truck follows it in the distant background, also moving from right to left.

In the first frame, a street scene unfolds under a clear blue sky with bright sunlight casting shadows. In the foreground left, a man in a dark suit is partially visible behind two white utility boxes. Behind these, a black car is stopped in the street, followed by a white pickup truck further down the road. On the midground right, three individuals stand on the sidewalk near a light rail shelter, with another person walking further away from the viewer along the same sidewalk. Across the street to the left, a building with large windows and several trees are visible, while more buildings line the right side of the street extending into the distance.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the man in the suit disappears from the left foreground. The black car then moves forward and out of the scene, followed by the white pickup truck that also proceeds past the utility boxes and exits the frame. Throughout these changes, the group of three people on the midground right sidewalk largely remains in place near the light rail shelter, while the distant pedestrian continues walking away along the right-side sidewalk.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures a bustling street scene from a sidewalk perspective, with a paved road and tram tracks stretching into the midground on the left, backed by buildings and trees. Central-right, a modern tram stop structure with a distinctive golden sculpture on its roof features three individuals standing with their backs to the viewer; to the far right on the sidewalk, a man in a black jacket walks away past adjacent storefronts. end of description
Across subsequent frames, the man on the right continues walking further away from the viewer, eventually moving mostly out of sight. A white car then emerges from the far left of the street, driving past the tram stop towards the viewer's right, followed by a dark sedan. Concurrently, the person in the red jacket at the tram stop is revealed to be pushing a baby stroller, now visible to their right.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows three people from behind in the mid-left, standing next to tram tracks. Further right is a bus stop shelter with an information board, next to which a man stands beside a baby stroller. To the far right, a sidewalk extends into the background, flanked by storefront buildings. In the background left, trees and additional buildings are visible, with a dark car partially seen behind the three individuals.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the street, the three people on the left continue their forward movement, gradually exiting the frame to the front-left, while the dark car behind them also proceeds forward on the tram tracks. The bus stop information board and the man with the stroller, initially to the viewer's right-center, become more prominent and shift towards the left side of the frame as the viewer passes them. The sidewalk and storefronts on the right continuously extend further into the perceived distance, showing a longer stretch of the street.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a white information board is visible on the far left. To its right, partially obscured, a person in a black shirt and cap stands facing away from the viewer, beside a stroller or cart filled with shopping bags. Directly ahead, a bus stop shelter with a green glass roof and a yellow "Congress 6th Ave" sign extends towards the viewer. Behind these, a street with tram tracks runs horizontally, lined with sparse trees and buildings. To the right, a sidewalk features a white trash can and storefronts, including one with "IGUANA" signage and a black Coca-Cola chalkboard sign in front of it.

end of description

The person in the black shirt and cap, along with the stroller, begins moving left across the frame. A second person, wearing a backpack, becomes visible from behind the first person, entering the frame from the left and also moving leftwards, eventually both exiting the scene towards the left. The area where they were standing is gradually revealed as empty.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a sunny urban street view from a sidewalk beside a tram stop. A person's dark clothing is partially visible in the immediate foreground left, alongside a tram stop column with a yellow 'Congress | 6th Ave' sign above, beyond which a street with tram tracks and distant buildings extends. To the right, a tree, a white trash can, and a vibrant row of storefronts with a Coca-Cola A-frame sign line the sidewalk, where pedestrians are seen walking further down.
end of description
The viewpoint dynamically moves forward along the sidewalk and subtly shifts right, causing the foreground person to disappear and revealing more of the street's left side and distant buildings. The tram stop column gradually moves left out of the frame's center, while the storefronts and sidewalk on the right become closer and more prominent as the scene progresses.
