The first frame displays a sunlit street scene featuring a paved road with white dashed lines on the left and a solid white line on the right, gently curving towards the viewer's right. To the immediate right is a paved sidewalk with a partial view of a building, while to the left, another paved sidewalk hosts small green trees and a light-colored building. In the mid-ground, a person in a reddish-brown jacket walks on the left sidewalk, approaching the viewer, and a light-colored car drives away on the road. Beyond, multiple buildings line the street, backed by imposing snow-capped mountains and green slopes under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds.

A pedestrian on the left sidewalk walks towards the viewer and crosses the road, moving out of view to the viewer's left. The light-colored car drives further away, eventually exiting the frame towards the right. Simultaneously, more pedestrians, some with luggage, appear on the right sidewalk, moving into the scene from the viewer's right. A street light pole with a banner becomes more fully visible on the left side of the central island as the perspective slightly shifts.

The first frame displays a town street with a paved road curving slightly left in the foreground, marked by a white arrow pointing left. To the left, a street pole with a colorful striped flag stands before distant green mountains, while on the right, traditional chalet-style buildings and a larger hotel with balconies line the street, populated by pedestrians and several parked or moving cars.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly moves forward, causing the curved road arrow to shift towards the bottom-left. The colorful flag on the pole to the left progressively moves out of view. Concurrently, a dark grey car gradually enters the scene from the far right, eventually parking behind the white SUV, while the white car previously driving in the midground moves further left and out of the frame.
