The first frame depicts a wet urban street at night, seen from a sidewalk. In the immediate foreground to the bottom right, there is a yellow sidewalk bordered by two black and yellow bollards. The street itself, occupying most of the frame, features a prominent white pedestrian crosswalk with horizontal stripes and a white arrow pointing left. Streetlights and distant traffic lights cast bright reflections on the rain-soaked asphalt. Along the left and right sides of the road, streetlights illuminate lush green trees, with red and green traffic lights visible on both sides, and a white outdoor umbrella on the far right. Distant buildings are faintly visible through the trees in the background under a dark sky, and multiple cars are present in the midground as bright headlights and taillights.
end of description
A white car emerges from the right midground, moving left across the pedestrian crosswalk. It continues across the foreground towards the left side of the frame. Subsequently, a black car enters the frame from the left, moving right across the crosswalk. This black car is followed by another dark vehicle, also moving right across the foreground. Simultaneously, other vehicles in the midground continue to move in the distance, while a red traffic light on the far right eventually turns green.
