The first frame shows a sidewalk extending forward from the viewer, bordered on the right by a modern building with dark grey paneling and large reflective windows, revealing an interior with warm lighting and reflections of a taller building on the far left. To the left of the sidewalk, a hedge and several small trees are visible, beyond which stands a multi-story residential building with numerous balconies under an overcast sky.

As the camera moves forward, the bright warm reflection in the largest window on the right gradually recedes leftward and eventually disappears from the frame, revealing more of the building's continuous grey paneled wall and subsequent windows further ahead. Simultaneously, the sidewalk's edge and hedges on the left move out of frame, exposing more of the street with parked cars and a utility pole further down the path. The tall residential building on the far left appears to shift slightly rightwards in the frame.
