The initial frame displays a stone-paved path receding into the distance, bordered on the left by a low metal railing with green bushes, and on the right by stone steps ascending to more green foliage and a tall evergreen tree; further to the mid-left are a stone lantern, several vertical wooden poles supporting an unseen canopy, and a traditional Japanese building with a wooden balcony, while a smaller white building with a bench is situated to the mid-right.

The viewpoint slowly moves forward and subtly shifts to the left. As the camera progresses, the stone lantern and the traditional building on the left grow larger and more prominent, while the white building and steps on the right recede into the background and become less visible, expanding the view of the grounds to the left of the path.
