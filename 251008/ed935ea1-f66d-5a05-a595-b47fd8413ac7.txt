The first frame displays a wide aerial view of a vibrant blue-turquoise ocean in the foreground, with a sandy beach and green hills stretching across the background under a partly cloudy sky. A white windsurfing board sails left of center, while an orange kite is visible on the beach to the right, adjacent to a rocky shoreline. end of description
Over subsequent frames, the windsurfing board continues its movement across the water towards the right from its initial position. The orange kite on the beach inflates and ascends, then tracks from its initial beach position out over the ocean towards the right. Throughout, small white splashes appear and dissipate across the ocean surface, particularly in the lower right and center.

The first frame presents an aerial view of a vibrant blue ocean with ripples in the foreground, extending towards a curving sandy beach in the midground. Several windsurfers and kitesurfers are visible on the water: a white-sailed windsurfer is in the lower-left, two red-sailed windsurfers are further center-left, an orange-kited surfer is near the beach's right edge, and another boarder trails a wake mid-right. Beyond the beach, green land rises to distant mountains, all under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. end of description. All subsequent frames are identical to the first, displaying no dynamic changes or newly revealed objects or scenes.

The first frame presents a wide aerial view of a blue-green ocean, with a white windsurfer to the left and an orange-kited surfer to the right, both moving away from the viewer. The mid-background features a sandy beach and rocky shore, backed by green fields and distant mountains under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the white windsurfer to the left continues moving further away from the first-frame viewpoint, its wake extending. Simultaneously, the orange-kited surfer to the right also progresses further away and slightly to the right of the original viewpoint, with its kite subtly shifting its position above the water. Other distant watercraft also show slight forward movement towards the background.
