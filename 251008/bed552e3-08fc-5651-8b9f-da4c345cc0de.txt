The first frame shows a busy city street, likely Times Square, bustling with pedestrians and bright billboards. In the foreground, to the viewer's left, a person in a black jacket and cap is partially visible. Centrally in the mid-ground, two individuals sit with their backs to the viewer on a dark bench-like structure. Further back and to the left, a person in a blue Cookie Monster costume walks away, while a person dressed as The Joker stands facing forward near the center, and a Minnie Mouse character in a pink gown stands to the viewer's right next to a balloon vendor's cart.

In subsequent frames, the blue Cookie Monster character continues moving away towards the left of the scene. A new character, Batman, emerges from the far left of the frame, behind the seated individuals, walking towards the right side. Batman then stops to the left of The Joker character, slightly further from the viewer. The Minnie Mouse character and The Joker remain largely stationary in their initial mid-ground positions, while general pedestrian movement continues in the background. The two people on the bench also remain in their seated positions throughout the sequence.
