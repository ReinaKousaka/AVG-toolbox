The first frame depicts a low-angle view of a fast-flowing, light-greenish river occupying the foreground and center, stretching towards a distant valley. Rocky banks line both sides, leading to dense evergreen forests on steep slopes, while a cloudy sky obscures the tops of distant mountains in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves rapidly upstream along the river. Objects like rocks and lighter sections of the riverbed, initially positioned ahead of the first-frame viewpoint, steadily approach and then move past the viewer's sides. The dense forests and mountain slopes on both banks also appear to sweep past, revealing new sections of the natural environment further upriver.
