The first frame displays a wide cobblestone street leading towards the distant Arc de Triomphe, visible centrally. Rows of green trees line both sides of the street, with buildings appearing behind them. In the mid-ground, various vehicles like cars, motorcycles, and a bus, along with pedestrians, are scattered across the road. Closer to the viewer on the right, a black car and a small grey utility truck are parked, while the sky above is partly cloudy.

In subsequent frames, vehicles and pedestrians in the middle ground exhibit subtle movements further down the street towards the distant Arc de Triomphe. Progressively, a white and blue cylindrical bollard emerges from the bottom right corner of the initial viewpoint, steadily moving leftward across the foreground. By the final frames, this newly revealed bollard occupies the lower right-center foreground, partially obscuring the parked vehicles that were stationary on the right side.

The first frame captures a wide cobblestone avenue extending towards the Arc de Triomphe, visible in the distant background under a blue sky with scattered clouds. A white bollard with text is positioned in the immediate foreground on the lower left, while the avenue is flanked by rows of green trees, behind which buildings and shops are visible on both sides. Several vehicles, including a white van on the far left, cars and a bus in the middle distance, and a small utility truck parked on the right, populate the street alongside various pedestrians on the sidewalks.

As the frames progress, the camera subtly pulls back, causing the foreground bollard to appear gradually smaller and revealing a slightly wider perspective of the scene, effectively receding from the original viewpoint. Vehicles on the street, including a dark car positioned in front of the utility truck on the right and other cars in the middle distance, exhibit minor forward movements away from the viewer, while pedestrians continue to walk along the sidewalks.
