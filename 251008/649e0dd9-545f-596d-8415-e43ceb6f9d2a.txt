The first frame shows a narrow street looking forward, flanked by multi-story buildings. To the left, a sidewalk runs alongside light-colored buildings, the closest having arched windows and a green balcony. To the right, several cars are parked along the curb, with a dark SUV closest to the viewer and a blue car directly behind it. The paved road stretches into the distance where more buildings and a red-topped street lamp are visible under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
Beginning in frame 3, the passenger door of the blue car on the right, further from the viewer, gradually opens. A person in a red shirt emerges from this car by frame 5, positioned to the right of the street. Subsequently, in frame 7, a white van appears parked behind the blue car on the right, and the person is then seen standing next to the blue car, looking into the van.

In the first frame, a street extends forward from the viewer, curving slightly to the left in the distance. To the immediate right, a man in a red shirt and blue pants stands next to the open driver's door of a dark blue car, which is parked parallel to the viewer. Further along the right side of the street, a white delivery van is parked behind the blue car, and a red-poled streetlamp stands between them, with a blue 'ahead only' traffic sign behind it. On the left side, a light-colored building with arched windows and flower boxes is visible, with a similar red-poled streetlamp closer to the viewer. A silver car drives away from the viewer in the midground, with more buildings lining both sides of the street under a blue sky with scattered clouds.
end of description
The man to the right slowly closes the car door, then walks forward and disappears behind the white van on the right side of the street. The silver car in the distance continues to drive further away from the viewer. No other significant dynamic changes or newly revealed objects occur relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a street view looking forward, flanked by multi-story buildings. On the left, an "APOTHEKE" building with a red 'A' logo precedes a pink building, while a white van on the right partially obscures the sidewalk and an adjacent building, next to a pole displaying a blue 'ahead only' sign; a silver car drives away in the mid-distance.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the white van on the right gradually moves away from the first-frame viewpoint, progressively revealing a brown wooden door and a brown square street sign on the building behind it. Concurrently, the silver car in the middle distance also retreats further, and the viewer's perspective subtly advances forward.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a paved street in a town, flanked by multi-story buildings, leading towards a distant square with more structures and small trees under a blue, cloudy sky. In the foreground, an ornate streetlamp is on the left, and a flower-filled planter with traffic signs stands on the right; a silver car is parked further down the street.
end of description
Throughout the frames, several people become active: one individual holding a multi-colored umbrella crosses the road from left to right, away from the viewer, emerging from behind the initially parked silver car. Concurrently, a pedestrian walks along the left pavement, moving towards and then mostly out of frame to the left, while another appears on the right pavement further down, walking towards the viewer. A yellow mailbox is also progressively revealed on the right pavement, further along the street, and the silver car incrementally moves forward, away from the viewer.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a cobblestone street leading into a town square, bordered by multi-story buildings with an outdoor cafe on the left. A grey car is centrally positioned with a man crossing behind it, while a woman walks on the right sidewalk past a street lamp, all under a blue sky with a distant forested hill.
end of description
The grey car proceeds further down the street away from the viewer, while the man completes crossing to the right sidewalk. The woman on the right sidewalk continues walking past the viewer, revealing a yellow postbox now visible on the mid-ground right sidewalk.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a cobblestone street leading towards a town square, flanked by multi-story buildings and trees under a cloudy blue sky. On the left, an outdoor cafe with people, red chairs, and umbrellas is visible, alongside parked bicycles and a colorful banner; in the center, a silver car faces away from the viewer. To the right, a person walks away on a sidewalk with trees and a "no entry" sign positioned towards the mid-right.
end of description
The person and the "no entry" sign on the right progressively move out of frame to the far right and recede further from the viewer. Subsequently, a series of dark barrier posts connected by chains appears on the right sidewalk, initially closer to the viewer than the vanishing sign, and then moves further away and slightly left. In the background, a distinctive reddish building with a small tower atop a forested hill gradually becomes more visible and prominent behind the buildings on the right side of the street as the viewer moves forward into the scene.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a cobblestone street receding from the viewer, with a silver car parked in the midground. To the left, there's a sidewalk with trees, a red banner, a bicycle, and a 'No Stopping' sign, while to the right, an open square features benches with people and a blue car, all set against a background of diverse historical buildings under a blue sky with scattered clouds.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, all visible objects, including the central silver car, the people on the benches, and the other vehicles, remain entirely static relative to the initial viewpoint, with no dynamic changes or newly revealed objects or scenes observed.
