The first frame displays a wet, reflective urban plaza under an overcast sky, framed by numerous multi-story buildings in the background. In the foreground, a large gray paved surface is visibly damp, reflecting the environment, with a yellow tactile paving strip extending along the right side. A small, crumpled white object rests on the wet pavement in the lower-center. In the mid-ground, several pedestrians holding umbrellas traverse the square, including individuals on the far left, near a prominent dark lamppost, and two on the far right. Small kiosks and red-rimmed planters are visible on the left side of the mid-ground.

People holding umbrellas are walking across the wet, reflective pavement from various directions in the mid-ground. A person initially near the central lamppost moves from facing away to facing the viewer, then walks left, eventually moving towards the far left. Simultaneously, another person with a white umbrella on the far left of the mid-ground walks right and exits the frame. Two individuals on the right, also with dark umbrellas, steadily walk forward towards the viewer's center-right. A small white crumpled object on the wet ground, initially in the center-foreground, is gradually disturbed and moves further left across the pavement.

The first frame presents a wet, reflective city square under an overcast sky, with numerous multi-story buildings forming the background. In the midground, a prominent lamppost stands slightly left of center, while several pedestrians holding umbrellas walk away from the viewer, including a group on the right near a yellow tactile strip and an individual to the left of the lamppost; small kiosks are visible on the far left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the original pedestrians continue moving further away from the viewer, with the group on the right gradually shifting right, and the individual on the left moving further left. A new pedestrian, carrying a purple umbrella, emerges from the far right of the first-frame viewpoint, walking across the scene towards the left and passing in front of the initial group. Simultaneously, another person with a lighter umbrella becomes visible further back and to the left of the lamppost, also moving left.

The first frame shows a rainy city square featuring a wet, reflective pavement, a prominent lamppost on the left, and tall buildings under a grey sky in the background, with several people holding umbrellas walking across the midground.
end of description
As frames progress, the woman with the teal umbrella initially on the left walks right and eventually exits the frame, while the woman with the purple umbrella on the right walks left, moving closer to the viewer before also exiting the frame to the left. Concurrently, the man in white with a dark umbrella in the center-back steadily recedes further into the distance. Subsequently, a new person with a dark umbrella emerges from the background, walking towards the viewer from the center-right, gradually moving further to the right as they approach. Additional figures in the far distance shift their positions, some moving further away, while others on the far right become clearer as they walk left.
