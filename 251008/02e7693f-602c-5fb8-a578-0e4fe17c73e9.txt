The first frame captures a multi-lane city street extending into the distance under an overcast sky, flanked by tall buildings. On the viewer's left, parked cars (including a black sedan and white SUV) and green trees line the sidewalk, alongside a '60 P' parking sign; on the right, a white sedan is parked, with more trees, a black building, and a 'P 60' sign.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the road, parked vehicles on both sides, such as the black sedan on the left and the white sedan on the right, progressively move out of view towards the bottom edges of the frame. Simultaneously, the 'P 60' street signs recede and exit the frame to the left and right, revealing new sections of the sidewalk, additional parked cars further ahead, and a blue directional arrow sign emerging on the right side of the road.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The viewer is positioned on a multi-lane city street looking forward, flanked by numerous tall buildings under an overcast sky. In the immediate left foreground, a white minivan is on the road next to a sidewalk with green trees and a blue street sign indicating a right turn. A dark sedan is visible ahead in the center lane, with other vehicles receding into the distance. On the right, a white and grey building with a blue arrow sign borders a sidewalk where more tall buildings, including one with "FUJITEC" and another with an "NT" logo, extend into the background.
end of description
The white minivan on the left gradually moves forward and exits the frame to the left. As it departs, a dark taxi is revealed, now parked on the street to the left of the original minivan's position. Simultaneously, the dark sedan in the center lane advances further down the street, while a few pedestrians become more clearly visible walking on the sidewalk to the right. Later, a silver sedan appears and parks behind the dark taxi on the left.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a multi-lane city street flanked by tall buildings, with a silver car on the near left, a dark taxi centrally ahead, and a white van parked on the right sidewalk, all under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances forward, the silver car on the left and the white van on the right recede from view, moving behind the initial first-frame position. The dark taxi continues ahead, while new sections of the street, building facades, and sidewalks are revealed ahead of the first-frame viewpoint. A new dark car appears on the left side of the road, behind the taxi, and a previously partially obscured parking sign on the right becomes fully visible, displaying details like 'P 8-20'.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a multi-lane city street looking forward, with a dark grey taxi (74-46) in the left foreground and other vehicles further ahead, all flanked by numerous multi-story buildings, including one on the right with a prominent blue "NT" sign in the background.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the initial taxi on the left slowly recedes, revealing a red car appearing directly to its left. Concurrently, a new black taxi emerges from the far right side of the frame, driving towards and then past the viewer, as the urban landscape on both sides continuously shifts by.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a multi-lane city street lined with tall buildings, viewed from a forward perspective within a vehicle. In the immediate foreground, partial views of a black taxi are seen on both the left and right sides, with another black car visible further down the road in the center-left lane.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the street, the foreground taxis recede and move out of frame to the left and right, revealing more of the sidewalks and road ahead. The black car initially in the mid-distance approaches and passes, while previously distant buildings and street features become clearer, and new urban elements, including a pedestrian on the right sidewalk, emerge further ahead.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, the viewer looks straight down a city street paved with asphalt, marked by white and yellow lines, receding into the distance. Multi-story urban buildings flank both sides of the road, featuring visible windows, facades, and ground-level storefronts, with lush greenery and streetlights along the sidewalks. Above the mid-ground, a gantry spans the road, displaying multiple blue arrow signs and a central square 60 km/h speed limit sign. On the road itself, a black SUV is positioned in the left lane, and a dark sedan is in the right lane, both ahead of the viewer. The distant background reveals more towering buildings under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. Consequently, the black SUV and dark sedan ahead slowly recede further into the distance relative to the initial position. The overhead gantry with its signs also moves higher and further away, eventually passing above the viewer's original position. Simultaneously, road markings initially close to the viewer shift towards the middle of the frame, revealing new asphalt and markings closer to the foreground. Objects on the sidewalks, like a green utility box on the right, also progress from mid-ground to foreground before exiting the frame.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a multi-lane city street lined with tall buildings under an overcast sky, viewed from a forward-moving perspective. Overhead, a gantry spans the road, holding several blue directional signs and a '60' speed limit sign above two cars, a black van and a dark sedan, positioned ahead on the roadway. Sidewalks flank both sides, showing pedestrians and street infrastructure.
end of description
Chronologically, the overhead gantry and its signs recede from view by the third frame, revealing a clearer perspective of the intersection ahead. Concurrently, traffic lights at this intersection illuminate green, and the viewer's position moves forward, bringing a crosswalk into full view in the immediate foreground.
