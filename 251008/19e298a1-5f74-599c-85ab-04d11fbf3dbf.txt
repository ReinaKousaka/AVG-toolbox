A dirt path occupies the left foreground, curving into the distance alongside a wooden railing. To the right of the railing, a steep, rocky bank descends to a river with white rapids, all enveloped by lush green foliage. A small child in a light jacket is visible further down the path, running away from the viewer.
end of description
The child on the path turns and runs towards the viewer, growing larger before exiting the frame to the lower left. Simultaneously, two adults appear further down the path, behind the child's initial position, and walk towards the viewer, becoming more visible in the mid-ground. They continue walking, maintaining their position further along the path as the child leaves the scene.
