A busy street scene at dusk features a brightly lit building with large glass windows and steps on the left, displaying Chinese characters. Many pedestrians gather on the sidewalk and at a crosswalk centrally positioned, while a tall glass building, a tree, and traffic lights, one showing red, occupy the right and background.

The assembled crowd at the crosswalk begins to move, with pedestrians crossing the street from both the left sidewalk and the far right. A woman in a blue top and black pants, holding hands and a bag, noticeably progresses from the mid-ground left towards the viewer's foreground. Further movement includes a scooter rider appearing from the far right background, contributing to the overall dispersal of people across the intersection.
