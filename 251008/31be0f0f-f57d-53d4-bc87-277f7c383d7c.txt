The first frame depicts a multi-story wooden chalet with green shutters and a balcony on the right, extending from the foreground to mid-ground. Behind it, on the far right, a modern grey building is partially visible, while to the left, towering rocky mountains, some snow-capped, rise in the background above a lush green grassy slope with pine trees.

The following frames show a slow pan to the left, revealing more of the extensive mountain valley to the left of the original peaks and a red flag on a pole appearing in the far left foreground, as the chalet recedes further right and eventually partially out of view.
