The first frame displays a street scene with a brick building occupying the left foreground, featuring multiple windows and a large entrance covered by a metal awning extending over the sidewalk. To the right, a sidewalk runs parallel to the street, bordered by a bare-branched tree and a row of yellow bike-share docks with bicycles. Further down the street on the right, additional brick buildings with fire escapes line the road, where several cars are parked and a white SUV is visible.

A person wearing dark clothing emerges from the midground, to the right of the bare tree and bike racks, walking leftward past the parked bike with a basket. This individual continues moving left, further down the sidewalk away from the viewer, eventually passing the bare tree. Simultaneously, another person in a white top is visible moving leftward on the distant sidewalk under the building awnings.

The first frame depicts a sunlit city street with a brick building to the left, featuring an entrance with a glass awning extending over the sidewalk. A bare-branched tree stands in a planter in the mid-ground, accompanied by black trash bags. To the right of the tree, a man sits on a scooter with a delivery bag, next to a row of docked yellow and blue rental bikes on the far right. Beyond these, parked cars and multi-story brick buildings with fire escapes line the street, extending into the background.
end of description
In the following frames, the man on the scooter in the mid-right slowly starts to move forward, gradually shifting left and further away from the viewer and the rental bikes. Concurrently, pedestrians are observed walking further down the sidewalk in the distant background, also moving away from the viewer. No other significant changes occur; the buildings and street elements remain static throughout the sequence.

The first frame depicts a city street scene with a brick building and a glass canopy extending from it over a sidewalk to the left. Along the sidewalk, further from the viewer, are trees, trash bags, and a row of yellow bike-share stations by the street, while the back of a person pushing a cart is prominently visible in the immediate foreground on the viewer's right.
end of description
In the following frames, the person with the cart slowly moves forward along the sidewalk, away from the viewer. This action progressively reveals more of the yellow bike-share stations and the street, previously obscured to the right of the person's initial foreground position.

The first frame presents a sunny urban street scene featuring a brick building with an open glass-paneled door on the viewer's left, beneath a glass awning. On the sidewalk in the midground, a person stands near trash bins and a vibrant green tree, while several black trash bags are piled beside a row of yellow stands further right. Across the street, parked cars line the curb in front of a grand brownstone building with multiple windows and decorative balconies.
end of description
In the following frames, the person initially visible on the midground sidewalk walks further away from the viewer, moving towards the background. They are joined by a second person, and both continue walking, eventually exiting the frame behind the tree on the left. No new objects or scenes are revealed, and other elements, including the parked cars and buildings, remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

In the first frame, a sunny urban street scene is depicted with a brick building and a partially open glass door on the far left, a pile of black trash bags on the foreground right, two women walking on the sidewalk in the midground, a large tree, and a row of yellow bike stands stretching along the right midground, with parked cars and more buildings lining the street in the background.
end of description
The two women walk on the sidewalk, moving from the midground towards the viewer. As they approach, more of the brick building on the left and the distant street scene become visible. The women pass the garbage bin and the tree, continuing their walk past the yellow bike stands. They move closer to the foreground, with their shadows extending behind them as the frame concludes.
