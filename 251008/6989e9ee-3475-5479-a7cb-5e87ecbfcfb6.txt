The first frame shows a nighttime urban street scene with a wet, reflective red brick sidewalk or path in the foreground. To the viewer's immediate left, a large, open garage door reveals a brightly lit, empty parking garage interior, with a light-colored building extending further along the path. To the viewer's right, a wet asphalt street runs parallel, lined with streetlights, trees (some decorated with string lights), and buildings with storefronts in the midground and background, all under a dark sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the brick path. The open garage entrance on the left recedes and eventually moves out of view, revealing more of the solid building facade as the viewer passes it. The street, streetlights, and buildings further ahead appear to get closer and become more detailed, indicating a continuous forward movement from the initial viewpoint.

The first frame shows a wet brick sidewalk extending from the viewer's foreground on the left towards the middle distance, littered with fallen leaves. To the viewer's left, a light-colored multi-story building with illuminated windows lines the path. Across a wet, reflective street, several streetlights illuminate a tree adorned with string lights in the middle distance, alongside a darker building with a covered entrance visible to the viewer's right. In the background, a dark night sky hovers above distant city lights.

The viewpoint slowly advances forward down the street. As it progresses, the building on the left (viewer's left) gradually reveals more of its facade. Concurrently, a prominent pillar-like structure to the right (viewer's right) becomes clearer, revealing the vertical inscription "NORDSTROM" across its surface. The covered entrance on the right also progressively comes into sharper and closer view.

The first frame presents a wet, reflective city street at night, with a brick sidewalk on the left and a darker asphalt street on the right, both lightly scattered with leaves in the foreground. Along the left, a building with illuminated windows and decorative string lights on trees lines the sidewalk, extending to a 'No Parking' sign located slightly left of the center in the midground. To the right, a tall light-colored column with "NORDSTROM" text stands in the midground, behind which another building with an awning and illuminated storefronts houses a distant person at the far right.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the immediate foreground pavement shifts, revealing new sections of wet ground and leaves further ahead. The 'No Parking' sign, streetlights, and buildings on both sides progressively shift towards the lower-left of the frame as they are approached. Additionally, faint vehicle headlights become more apparent in the mid-distance on the left side of the street.
