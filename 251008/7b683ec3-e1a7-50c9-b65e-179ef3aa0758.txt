The first frame presents an aerial view of a city under a partly cloudy blue sky, with green mountains in the far background to the left. In the mid-ground, a prominent white domed church (Duomo Nuovo) stands left of center, flanked by a tall, slender bell tower to its left and a large square surrounded by white arched buildings to its right. To the far right, a tall, brown, multi-story building with a distinctive top is visible, while the foreground is dominated by numerous red-tiled rooftops, and a white building with a small red and blue flag is partially visible in the bottom-left corner.

The viewpoint dynamically zooms out slightly and pans to the right, gradually revealing more of the cityscape previously located to the right of the first-frame view. As the camera pans, the white building and flag on the far left of the initial frame shift further left and move progressively out of view. Simultaneously, new structures on the right side of the city, including more of the tall brown building, become increasingly visible, expanding the perceived urban breadth.

The first frame captures an aerial view of a city under a partly cloudy sky, with a prominent white domed cathedral on the mid-left and a tall, brown building on the mid-right. Between them, a large white building with a clock tower fronts a plaza, all surrounded by dense red-tiled roofs and extending to a distant hilly horizon on the far left.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly shifts to the right, causing the entire scene to gradually drift left across subsequent frames. This subtle movement progressively reveals more of the urban landscape to the right of the initial view as the domed cathedral moves further towards the left edge of the frame.
