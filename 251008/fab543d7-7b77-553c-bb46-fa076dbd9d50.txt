The first frame depicts a narrow urban street receding into the distance, flanked by brick buildings and parked vehicles including a white car and a red pickup truck on the right. In the foreground-left, two white A-frame signs are positioned near an open doorway of a brick building featuring a large white 'S' on its wall, with several pedestrians visible in the street, notably two walking away in the mid-right and one near the left entrance.
end of description
As the frames progress, the two primary individuals in the mid-right continue walking further down the street, away from the first-frame viewpoint, while more pedestrians emerge from the left building entrance and walk towards the viewer's initial position or across the street. Concurrently, additional people become visible deeper in the street, passing the red pickup truck on the right, and the person initially at the left entrance moves further inside the building.

The first frame displays a bustling narrow street filled with pedestrians, buildings, and parked vehicles. In the immediate foreground, two individuals walk towards the viewer: one on the left in a green hoodie and another on the right in a grey top, while a group of people walk away into the distance in the mid-ground. Brick buildings, including one with a "MUSINSA" sign, line the left side, and a red pickup truck is prominently parked on the right.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the foreground pedestrians move past the original viewpoint, exiting to the left and right. Concurrently, more individuals continuously emerge from the distant background and enter from the far left, walking closer to and then past the initial viewpoint, revealing additional cardboard boxes on the left street side.

The first frame depicts a narrow city street or alleyway flanked by brick buildings under a clear sky. In the immediate foreground on the left, two men walk towards the viewer, the closest wearing a grey cardigan and white pants, and the other a long olive coat. A red pickup truck is parked on the right, facing away from the viewer. Further down the street, several pedestrians are walking away from the viewer, with white cars visible on the left side of the street near a building marked "MUSINSA".
end of description
As the frames advance, the two men initially in the foreground on the left walk past the viewer, gradually moving towards and then out of the left edge of the frame. The pedestrians in the midground continue walking away, receding further into the distance relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The stationary red pickup truck on the right and the surrounding buildings subtly shift backward as the camera's viewpoint slowly progresses forward through the street.

The first frame captures a narrow city street looking ahead, with a red pickup truck partially visible on the right foreground. To the left, a white Volkswagen car is parked beside cardboard boxes and a white A-frame sign, in front of a building with a 'MUSINSA' sign. Many pedestrians populate the street's center, walking away from the viewer, while buildings line both sides, including a brick structure with balconies on the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera subtly moves forward. The pedestrians continue walking further down the street, away from the initial viewpoint, with the man previously holding a cup on the left moving ahead and eventually wiping his forehead. The red pickup truck on the right and the white car on the left remain largely stationary relative to their first-frame positions.

In the first frame, a street scene unfolds with multiple people and vehicles. To the far right, a partial view of a red car, including its front-right quarter panel, headlight, and windshield, is visible. On the left side, a man in a light hoodie and jeans is walking towards the left, with a white Volkswagen Golf parked behind him. In the center midground, several pedestrians are walking in both directions, and further down the street, a silver BMW sedan faces the viewer. Buildings line both sides of the street: on the left, a brown building features a vertical 'Musinsa' sign, while on the right, a brick building has an entrance with a queue of people extending towards the viewer, and a sign 'Maple Top' above. The background shows more distant buildings, utility poles, and a clear sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the man on the left continues walking further left and eventually exits the frame. The group of pedestrians in the midground centralize and move, with some approaching the viewer and others moving away. The silver BMW in the midground slowly advances closer towards the viewer's position. The queue of people by the brick building on the right subtly shifts and grows longer as more individuals join and move within the line.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A busy, narrow street is depicted, with a silver BMW sedan parked centrally, facing the viewer. To the left, a white car and a dark sedan are parked alongside a brick building with metal structures, as pedestrians walk towards the viewer. On the right, a large crowd of people gathers in front of a brick building with arched entrances, marked by traffic cones and a sign.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the silver BMW remains stationary in the street. The two women walking on the left foreground continue to move past the viewer, revealing more of the white car parked closest to the viewer's left. Other pedestrians on the left side also move, some walking towards the viewer and others further down the street, while the crowd on the right generally maintains its position with minor individual shifts.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a narrow street with a silver BMW sedan in the mid-ground, facing the viewer with illuminated headlights; a black car is parked behind it to the left. To the right, a crowd of people stands and walks alongside a red brick building, featuring a white sign with a QR code in the foreground, while other buildings extend into the background under a clear sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the BMW slowly moves forward, drawing closer to the viewer and gradually exiting the left side of the frame. Concurrently, the crowd of people and the white sign on the right recede further down the street, revealing more of the red brick building's lower facade previously hidden behind them.
