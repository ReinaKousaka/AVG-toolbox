In the first frame, a person with blonde hair, wearing a brown coat and carrying a black bag, walks away from the viewer on a city sidewalk in the foreground. To their right, closer to the street, a gold bicycle is parked. Along the left side of the sidewalk are storefronts, including a "Nails & Spa" and a "Deli," with other pedestrians visible further down. To the right of the bicycle is a street with a green bike lane; a dark SUV is parked there with an open passenger door and a person standing near it. In the midground, a white flowering tree is visible, and in the background, numerous tall buildings and skyscrapers rise under a blue sky.

The person in the foreground continues walking forward, moving slightly further from the viewer. Simultaneously, another pedestrian emerges behind and to the left of the main subject, also moving forward. On the street to the right, a black minivan appears and drives from the midground towards the foreground, passing the parked SUV.

The first frame presents a bustling street scene with a blonde woman in a brown coat walking away from the viewer on the left sidewalk, carrying a black bag. To her right, a bare tree stands before a green bicycle with a brown seat, parked on the green-painted bike lane. On the road to the right of the bike lane, a black SUV is stopped with its passenger door slightly ajar, with another black vehicle behind it, and various cars and a white van visible further down the street. Buildings with storefronts line the left, and tall city buildings dominate the background under a blue sky, with a white-blossomed tree visible in the midground.
end of description
The blonde woman on the left sidewalk continuously walks further away from the viewer. Concurrently, a person dressed in white emerges from the passenger side of the black SUV, located in the midground to the right of the bicycle, gradually stepping onto the street. The SUV's passenger door remains open as the individual exits, and other vehicles in the mid-distance subtly shift their positions with the flow of traffic.
