In the first frame, train tracks covered in gravel run centrally into the distance, curving gently to the left. Lush green grassy fields flank both sides of the tracks, leading up to a distant backdrop of forested hills shrouded in low-hanging clouds. Several overhead wires extend across the upper portion of the scene.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the tracks as an overhead wiring support pole, initially in the mid-distance, approaches, passes centrally overhead, and exits to the far left. Simultaneously, smaller fence posts on the right side and a thin vertical pole on the far left approach and pass the viewer. From frame five, raindrops become visible on the immediate foreground of the viewer's perspective.
