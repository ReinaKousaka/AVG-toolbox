The first frame depicts a bustling cobblestone street extending into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings on both sides under a clear sky. Numerous pedestrians walk along the street, with a street lamp visible on the right in the mid-ground and shop windows displaying mannequins on the immediate right.

As the frames progress, the pedestrians actively move: a woman on the far left, initially waving, shifts backward and further left; a man holding papers in the center-left advances further down the street; and a woman in a brown coat on the right moves away from the viewer, her coat visibly billowing.

The first frame depicts a pedestrian street stretching into the distance, lined with multi-story buildings and storefronts under a light blue sky. In the foreground, a man in a dark green jacket walks towards the viewer on the left, while a dark grey pole stands prominently on the right. Centrally, a woman in a long brown coat and backpack walks away from the viewer down the cobblestone street; on her right, a storefront window displays colorful flat-art mannequins. Numerous other pedestrians are visible throughout the midground and background, moving in various directions along the street flanked by more buildings.

The man in the dark green jacket, initially on the left in the foreground, moves towards and then past the viewer, shifting slightly rightwards. Simultaneously, the woman in the long brown coat progresses further away from the first-frame viewpoint down the center of the street. The man on the right continues his movement away from the viewer, advancing along the right storefront. All other visible pedestrians throughout the street also move, either walking further into the distance or closer towards the original viewpoint, without revealing any new objects or scenes from outside the initial frame.
