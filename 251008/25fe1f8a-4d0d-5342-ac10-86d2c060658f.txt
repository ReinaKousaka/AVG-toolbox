The first frame depicts a narrow urban alleyway with multi-story buildings on both sides under an overcast sky. In the foreground on the left, two bicycles are parked near orange traffic cones and a tiled wall with visible signs and an air conditioner, while on the far right, a purple storefront with a red awning and illuminated interior is partially visible. The alley extends into the background, lined with more buildings, parked bicycles, and utility poles, with a taller building visible at the distant end.
end of description
As the camera slowly pans to the right, the purple storefront on the far right of the initial view gradually moves out of frame to the right, revealing more of the adjacent tiled wall and a light pole initially partially obscured. Simultaneously, the left tiled wall becomes more prominent, shifting right relative to the frame center as the viewpoint pivots right.

The first frame depicts a narrow urban alleyway, looking forward between white buildings. A black bicycle and two orange traffic cones are in the foreground left, while vending machines and other parked bicycles line the building to the right, all receding towards a taller grey building in the distance. end of description. As the camera smoothly dollies forward into the alley, the immediate foreground bicycle and cones shift further left out of view, while the buildings on both sides reveal more of their facades ahead, bringing the distant alley scene closer to the viewer.

The viewer is positioned in a narrow urban alleyway. To the immediate left is a modern white building with a dark entryway and a window above it, next to a dimly lit section where a covered scooter is parked. On the right, an older building with balconies houses a white graffiti-covered vending machine and a blue one, with several bicycles parked in front and between them. The alley stretches forward, flanked by various buildings receding into the overcast distance.
end of description
The camera slowly advances down the alley. As the viewpoint shifts, a "TAMAI 3014" nameplate becomes visible on the white building to the left, which was previously out of view. On the right, the white vending machine moves further into the foreground, revealing more of its graffitied surface. The blue vending machine next to it also becomes clearer, displaying "SAPPORO" branding, while the bikes parked further ahead to the right of the original view become more distinct.

The first frame depicts a narrow urban alleyway lined by buildings; to the left are a white building with a dark doorway, a scooter, and a bicycle with a rain cover. On the right, two vending machines (one blue 'Asahi Soft Drinks') and several parked bicycles are prominent, with the alley receding towards more buildings and a distant tall structure. end of description. Subsequently, the view pans steadily to the right, causing the blue and white vending machines to exit the frame on the right side. This movement reveals more bicycles parked further to the right and a greater expanse of the right-side building's facade, while objects on the left maintain their relative positions but shift within the frame.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a narrow, wet asphalt alley extending into the distance under an overcast sky. In the foreground to the left is a bicycle with a front basket and a child seat covered by a clear rain shield, partially obscuring a light gray storage cabinet next to a white textured wall. Further left is a small scooter. To the foreground right, another bicycle with a covered child seat is partially visible. Buildings line both sides of the alley, featuring pipes, wires, and various windows; a tall building is visible at the alley's far end.
end of description
The viewer moves forward into the alley. Objects previously in the foreground, such as the scooter and the bicycles, exit the frame to the left and right, respectively. The light gray storage cabinet on the left shifts further left and partially out of view, while the alley's buildings and parked bicycles become closer and more detailed. A wall lamp on the right side of the alley becomes noticeably brighter as the viewer advances, illuminating more of the immediate surroundings.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
From the viewer's position in a narrow, wet alley, a white-paneled wall and a dark storage unit are immediately to the left, followed by a building adorned with pipes, wires, and plants. To the right, a cream-colored building with a light fixture and two air conditioning units is visible, leading to a darker wooden structure further down. Ahead, the alley narrows, with an advertising board on the left and a bicycle parked against the right wall, culminating in several taller buildings in the background under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera advances forward into the alley from the initial viewpoint. Consequently, objects initially closest to the viewer on the immediate left (white-paneled wall, storage unit) and right (cream building, AC units) gradually shift out of the frame's edges. Concurrently, the advertising board on the left and the bicycle parked further down the alley on the right appear to grow larger and become more central, indicating the viewer is moving closer to them. The distant background buildings also incrementally increase in size, confirming a continuous forward movement through the alley relative to the initial starting point.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a narrow, wet alleyway with buildings on both sides. To the viewer's immediate left stands a grey building with exposed pipes, an electrical meter, and two grey buckets near the ground, followed by a wooden door and a green awning further into the alley. On the immediate right, a dark wooden building with an air conditioning unit and some plants is visible, while a bicycle leans against it further down the path. In the background, tall, modern buildings are seen at the alley's end.

end of description

As the frames progress, the camera slowly moves forward into the alley. The immediate foreground elements on both the left (pipes, meter, buckets) and right (AC unit) recede and move out of view, revealing more of the path ahead. The bicycle on the right and a blue object with a tilted black structure on the left become more centrally positioned as the viewer advances towards the distant buildings visible in the background.
