In the first frame, a blue pickup truck is partially visible in the foreground on the right, parked beside a wet asphalt road. Further down the right side, several dark cars are also parked. On the left side of the road, a blue SUV and a light blue hatchback are parked, backed by a large building with arched windows. Lush green trees line both sides of the street, and a multi-story building is visible in the distant background.

A white car appears in the far distance on the main road, slowly approaching the viewer. Simultaneously, a person holding a dark umbrella emerges on the far right sidewalk, walking away from the viewer, beyond the parked cars. A new dark car then pulls up and parks on the right side of the street, positioning itself in the midground, between a previously parked dark car and the blue pickup truck closer to the viewer. The white car continues its steady advance towards the viewer.

The first frame displays a wet, two-lane street receding into the distance, flanked by parked cars on both sides: a blue truck bed and a dark grey sedan are in the immediate foreground right, while a blue SUV and a white car are parked along the left curb next to a large building. end of description. A silver taxi with a blue and yellow stripe and illuminated headlights emerges from the distant center-left, progressively driving closer towards the viewer. It passes by the blue SUV parked on the left curb, then moves past the viewer's left, exiting the frame. The scene then reverts to its initial state, with the other parked cars remaining stationary.

The first frame depicts a wet urban street with vehicles parked on both sides under an overcast sky. In the foreground right, a dark grey SUV is visible, with a dark car partially to its right, while on the left, a blue Chevrolet SUV is parked. Lines of other cars extend down the street on both sides, leading towards a distant tunnel or underpass, flanked by trees and buildings.

Subsequently, the dark grey SUV in the foreground right begins to move forward, away from the viewer, as does the blue Chevrolet SUV in the foreground left. Simultaneously, the white SUV behind the blue car on the left and the white SUV behind the dark grey SUV on the right also advance forward, further down the street relative to the initial viewpoint. This continuous forward motion causes all foreground vehicles to shift away from the viewer's original position.
