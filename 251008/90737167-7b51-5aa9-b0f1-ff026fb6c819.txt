In the foreground to the left, a red bench with visible text sits beside a wooden fence, separating a paved road from a lush green field. On the right side of the paved road, a cluster of tall trees shades a small building, with a green trash bin nearby. Four individuals are seen walking away from the viewer on this road, towards the distant, majestic rocky mountains that dominate the background, flanked by green forests under a blue sky.

As the frames progress, the four people on the road move consistently further away from the viewer. A blue sign post becomes visible on the right side of the road, positioned behind the green trash bin relative to the viewer's initial position. One of the walkers also begins using walking poles as they continue to recede.

A paved road leads away into a valley framed by towering mountains and a blue sky with some clouds. To the left, a grassy field is separated by a wooden fence, while a line of trees borders the road on the right, with a small shelter visible among them. Four individuals – a child in a pink hat, a woman with hiking poles, a man with hiking poles, and another man in a blue shirt – walk away from the viewer on the road and its right shoulder.
end of description
As the frames progress, the child and the two adults with hiking poles continue walking down the road, moving further away from the viewer and eventually exiting the scene to the foreground's right. The man in the blue shirt moves off the road to the right, interacting with a newly revealed person near the trees, and they both recede into the background. A yellow signpost with directional arrows and a red circular sign become fully visible on the left side of the road in the midground, having been previously obscured by the walkers.
