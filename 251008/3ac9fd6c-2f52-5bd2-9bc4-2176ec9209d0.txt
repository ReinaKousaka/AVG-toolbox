The first frame displays a wet city street on an overcast day, with a prominent crosswalk in the immediate foreground and a traffic light pole with blue directional signs on the far left. Various cars are visible on the road, leading towards a mixture of autumn trees and distant buildings, with a modern, tall building standing out on the far right.

Subsequently, a person carrying a black umbrella emerges from the mid-right, walking across the central crosswalk towards the left side of the frame. Simultaneously, a black car previously on the far left moves away, revealing a white car that then proceeds across the left road segment and exits the scene. The pedestrian continues traversing the crosswalk, eventually reaching the left edge of the road within the final frames.

The first frame shows a wet city street on an overcast day, with a pedestrian crossing marked by white stripes directly in front of the viewer. Yellow tactile paving borders the crossing to the left and right. A person holding a black umbrella stands on the crossing, slightly right of the frame's center. To the left, a street with parked and slow-moving cars extends into the distance, bordered by green foliage and distant buildings under a cloudy sky. To the right, a sidewalk with autumn-colored trees and bushes leads towards a modern high-rise building and an older brick building in the background.

The person with the black umbrella begins walking forward and to the left, traversing the pedestrian crossing directly in front of the viewer. They continue moving towards the viewer's left, receding slightly into the midground as they pass. Concurrently, a person with a blue umbrella, initially less distinct further back on the midground sidewalk to the right of the first person, becomes clearer while also moving left. The person with the black umbrella ultimately moves out of view to the far left of the frame.

The first frame depicts a wet urban street on an overcast day. A patterned sidewalk runs across the foreground, bordering a rainy asphalt road on the left with a queue of cars, and a planted area on the right where a dark SUV is parked; buildings and autumn trees line the distant background.
end of description
Subsequently, a person on a bicycle holding a blue umbrella, initially positioned mid-left on the road, proceeds forward past the viewer's center. Concurrently, several pedestrians emerge from the mid-right on the sidewalk, walking towards the viewer, with some holding umbrellas and eventually passing into the left foreground. The parked cars on the left and the SUV on the far right remain static throughout the sequence.
