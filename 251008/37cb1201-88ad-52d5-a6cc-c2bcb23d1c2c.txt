The first frame captures a dark wooden piano top with visible keys on the far left. On the piano's surface, a decorative wooden book holder sits centrally, backed by a white-framed photo, a black-shaded lamp, various books, and a round golden picture frame, all beneath a large landscape painting and additional artworks on the wall.

As the camera pans right, the initial black-shaded lamp moves out of view to the left, while new books become visible on the right. Further right, a light-colored lamp with a textured base and a black shade appears, followed by another framed artwork on the far right wall, all previously unseen beyond the first frame's right edge.
