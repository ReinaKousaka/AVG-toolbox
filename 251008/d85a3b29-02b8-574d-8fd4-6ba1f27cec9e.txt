In the first frame, a cobblestone street with a white pedestrian crossing stretches across the foreground. To the left, a densely packed hillside town with multi-storied buildings of various colors (red, beige, brown) ascends steeply, topped by a distant fortified structure. A white van is parked on the street to the left, with other cars further down. Dominating the right side of the frame is a large, bare-branched tree, with a black streetlamp post and two yellow lights positioned immediately to its right. Below the tree, two wooden benches rest alongside a stone barrier, and beyond that, a glimpse of a lower, barren slope with trees is visible under a cloudy sky.
end of description
The scene exhibits a subtle rightward shift in perspective over the frames. Progressively, more of the stone barrier and the earth and bare trees to its right are revealed on the far right side of the view. Concurrently, the streetlamp and the large bare tree subtly move leftwards within the frame, allowing the previously unseen elements on the right to become more prominent relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
