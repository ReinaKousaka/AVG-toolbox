A rainy urban street scene is visible, featuring a wet pavement in the foreground with a metal fence and orange cones on the left. A tree stands centrally with a black utility bin to its right, while a blue-handled railing is partially seen on the far right. In the midground, a white SUV moves right on the road behind the fence, and several pedestrians with umbrellas are on or approaching the crosswalk to the right of the tree, with traffic lights displaying red and yellow signals. The background consists of tall buildings lining both sides of the street, featuring commercial signs on the right, all under an overcast sky.
end of description
The white SUV on the left drives right and exits the frame. Concurrently, a black van on the far right opens its sliding door, and a person exits, moving onto the crosswalk to the right of the tree. A new small white van appears briefly behind the black van, then also moves out of view to the right. As the person from the black van continues to cross towards the viewer's right, a black car emerges on the left side of the street, moving right. This pedestrian eventually passes the black bin, while the black car continues to advance on the left.
