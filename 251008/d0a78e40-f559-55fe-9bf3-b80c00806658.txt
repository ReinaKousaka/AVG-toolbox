The first frame presents an outdoor market scene under a clear blue sky, featuring diverse city buildings in the background. In the foreground, a man in a yellow shirt is positioned to the viewer's left, while three individuals—two women and a man—walk away from the viewer towards numerous white market tents lining both sides of the path in the midground.

As the viewpoint progresses forward, the yellow-shirted man moves out of frame to the viewer's left, while the three central individuals continue walking ahead. More people and market details are continuously revealed ahead and to the sides among the stalls. A cyclist then appears from the far left of the foreground, moving across the scene to the right and passing the woman in the striped top.
