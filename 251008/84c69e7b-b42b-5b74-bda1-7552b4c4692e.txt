The first frame shows a bustling urban street scene from the perspective of a pedestrian. In the immediate foreground, a dark lamppost stands vertically on the right side, partially obscuring a woman in a black vest and sunglasses walking towards the viewer, holding a patterned bag. To the left of the lamppost, a bare tree trunk rises from the sidewalk. Both sides of the street are lined with multi-story buildings housing various shops, including a "SHOE MARKER" on the right and a store with large glass windows (possibly "New Balance") on the left. Numerous pedestrians are scattered throughout the midground and background, walking in both directions along the paved street which recedes into the distance under a bright sky.
end of description
The camera slowly advances forward along the street. The woman in the black vest, initially partially hidden by the lamppost in the foreground, continues walking towards the viewer, gradually moving past the lamppost to its left, then towards the left edge of the frame, revealing her full figure. Simultaneously, the man in the black hoodie and white pants continues to walk further away down the street. Other pedestrians in the midground and background also move, some walking towards the viewer and others receding into the distance. As the viewpoint shifts, more of the street and the shop facades on both sides become visible, expanding the perceived depth of the scene.
