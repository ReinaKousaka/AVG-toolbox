The first frame depicts a city street under a clear blue sky, with a dark pole featuring a green traffic light and yield sign positioned in the foreground, center-left, next to a pedestrian crossing. Historic multi-story buildings line the road to the left, where parked cars are visible, while on the right, a person walks on the sidewalk adjacent to a long green hoarding that extends into the midground.
end of description
The traffic light then dims as a dark scooter and subsequently a black car appear on the road to the left, both moving away from the viewer. Concurrently, the green hoarding on the right recedes, gradually revealing a multi-arched bridge and water in the background, as the person on the sidewalk continues moving deeper into the scene. Finally, a black van drives past the viewer on the road to the left.

The first frame shows a Parisian street scene with classic multi-story buildings lining the left, a black minivan driving away from the viewer on the street, and a man walking towards the viewer on the right-side sidewalk, which is separated by a stone wall from a river with bridges and buildings beyond.
end of description
As frames progress, the man walks further past the viewer and out of the scene to the right, while the black minivan continues to recede down the street to the left. A white car then enters the frame from the viewer's left, also moving away down the street, followed by a light blue "France Express" delivery van, which also passes by on the viewer's left.

The first frame depicts a Parisian street with a sidewalk in the foreground-right and a road to its left, where a blue 'FRANCE EXPRESS' van is parked alongside multi-story buildings. A bus stop sign stands in the middle-left, while a stone wall with green sheds runs along the right, overlooking a river and distant city structures.
end of description
A scooter subsequently travels from the far left of the road, passing the 'FRANCE EXPRESS' van and the bus stop sign before exiting to the far right. Following this, a cyclist emerges from the left on the road, also passing the van and sign as they move right. Subsequently, a black car appears from the far left on the road, moving past the remaining vehicles and the bus stop sign before exiting to the viewer's right.
