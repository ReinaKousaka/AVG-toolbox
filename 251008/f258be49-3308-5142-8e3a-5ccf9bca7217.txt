The first frame depicts a city sidewalk scene with storefronts and multi-story buildings lining the left, featuring fire escapes and large display windows. To the right, a street runs parallel, bordered by trees and brick buildings, with a yellow taxi and a silver car visible further down. In the immediate foreground, slightly right of center, an orange shopping cart containing various items rests on the sidewalk.

Subsequently, the orange shopping cart, followed by yellow barriers, moves away from the viewer to the right. A yellow newspaper stand, then a bicycle, and a red postbox are progressively revealed behind the cart's initial position, also moving further away from the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, a pedestrian approaches from the distant left sidewalk, passing the viewer, while a new black car passes the yellow taxi on the street to the right.
