The first frame captures a bustling city sidewalk with numerous pedestrians. A woman in a beige coat and scarf, smiling, walks right of the viewer's center, flanked by a man in a green sweater and beanie to her left, and a partially visible person in a blue jacket on the far left. To the far right, a woman in a maroon top is partially seen, while the background reveals tall city buildings, storefront ads, and street vehicles like a white delivery van.
end of description
The central woman and the man to her left move forward and slightly right of their initial first-frame positions, gradually revealing more of the street and pedestrians previously behind them. As they proceed, new individuals emerge from behind their initial positions and continue walking forward in the midground and background. The woman on the far right shifts further right, eventually exiting the frame, opening up more of the background storefronts and street beyond her initial spot.

The first frame depicts a busy city street with numerous pedestrians on a wide sidewalk, flanked by tall buildings on both sides. To the right, a building facade displays large advertisements, while a white delivery truck and a blue car are visible on the street further down; on the left, more urban buildings line the street. In the foreground, a man in a dark turtleneck and sunglasses walks towards the viewer from the left, accompanied by other individuals.
end of description
As the frames progress, the man in the dark turtleneck moves past the viewer towards the far left of the frame. A new bearded man appears from the mid-left and walks towards the viewer, eventually occupying the foreground as the previous man exits. The diverse crowd of pedestrians continuously moves, with some individuals passing further away from the viewer to the right and others approaching from the background.

The first frame presents a city street looking forward, with a bearded man in a brown jacket walking towards the viewer's center-left foreground, flanked by golden bollards, and several women standing on the right sidewalk. A bustling crosswalk stretches across the mid-ground with more pedestrians, a light blue car moving away on the left, and a blue sedan parked on the right, all beneath towering city buildings receding into the distance under a cloudy sky.
end of description
Throughout subsequent frames, the bearded man exits left from the foreground, while the pedestrians on the crosswalk and right sidewalk steadily move forward, receding away from the viewer's position. A large white truck is newly revealed appearing further down the street on the viewer's left, behind where the light blue car was initially located. The light blue car also continues to move further away on the left, demonstrating a continuous flow of traffic and people moving past the static first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame displays a bustling city street with a wide crosswalk in the foreground where numerous pedestrians are actively crossing, including a woman in a plaid jacket and a bald man positioned center-left, alongside a woman walking away from the viewer towards the center-right, all flanked by prominent gold bollards on the stripes. Tall buildings line both sides of the thoroughfare, with a white semi-truck on the left side of the street and a blue sedan beside a white delivery van stopped on the right side, further back from the crosswalk.
end of description
Over the subsequent frames, the foreground pedestrians continue moving left across the crosswalk, while those on the right side of the crosswalk move further away from the viewer and to the left, revealing more of the street. Concurrently, the blue sedan and white van on the right side of the street slowly advance further to the right. A new man in a leather jacket and sunglasses emerges from the far left of the frame, moving towards the viewer, and a person wearing a yellow safety vest becomes visible in the midground, standing near the crosswalk on the left side of the street.

The first frame shows a bustling city street from a pedestrian's viewpoint on a crosswalk, with two women walking away in the foreground, a blue car partially visible bottom right, and a police officer by a flatbed truck on the far left. Tall buildings line the street, which is active with other pedestrians and vehicles in the midground.
end of description
As the frames progress, the two women in the foreground continue walking away from the viewer. Concurrently, a woman in a light coat and a man holding a white package, both initially in the midground to the viewer's left, walk towards and then pass the viewer's immediate right side on the crosswalk. Other pedestrians also continue to move across the street, while the parked vehicles and background buildings remain largely stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a busy city street, featuring a man in sunglasses holding a white package in the left foreground, and two women with their backs to the viewer standing on a zebra crosswalk in the right foreground. Numerous other pedestrians are visible in the midground crossing the street and walking along sidewalks, flanked by tall buildings on both sides under a bright sky, with a white car partially visible on the far right.

end of description
Subsequently, the man in the left foreground and the two women on the right move out of frame, while other pedestrians dynamically cross and fill the street ahead. A man in a grey hoodie emerges from the far left, moving towards the center, as the white car on the far right also moves away.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a busy city sidewalk under a clear sky. In the immediate foreground, the left side shows the back of a person's head and shoulder, while to the right, the back of a person with a brown backpack is visible. Numerous pedestrians populate the midground, walking in various directions. To the left, tall buildings feature a visible "Nike" logo, a "ONE WAY" sign, and a traffic light, with white cars seen further down the street. To the right, modern storefronts with mannequins and reflective surfaces line the street, with distant buildings and a blue sky overhead.
end of description
Following the first frame, the crowd of pedestrians on the sidewalk continuously moves, with individuals constantly entering from the deeper background and the sides, and exiting the frame. The partial figure on the far left quickly moves out of view. A steady stream of people, including a man in a black vest and glasses, and a woman with a dark scarf and yellow bag, walk directly towards the viewer on the left side of the frame, passing by and moving towards the bottom left. Simultaneously, the person with the brown backpack on the right progresses further away from the viewer, as new figures emerge from the receding depth of the street.
