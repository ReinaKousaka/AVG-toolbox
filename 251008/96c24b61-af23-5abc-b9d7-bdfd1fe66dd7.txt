The first frame displays a snow-covered urban pathway leading away from the viewer, with footprints visible. To the left, a building with white walls and green awnings features large windows showing interior lights, with snow-dusted bushes in front. To the right of the path stand several bare, snow-laden trees and a street lamp, with tall city buildings visible in the distant background under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the path. The building on the left recedes, revealing a "SEOUL GARDEN" sign on the green awning and more of its facade, while the foreground bushes move out of view. The trees and street lamp to the right also shift their relative positions as the camera advances further down the snowy path.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a snow-covered urban landscape. To the immediate left, snow-dusted bushes sit in front of a building with a large window reflecting interior lights and a prominent green awning above. A snow-covered path extends from the foreground into the distance, lined on the left by more bare trees and on the right by a park area with a low fence and additional snow-covered trees. Several streetlights are positioned along the path, and tall buildings are visible in the background, peeking through the bare branches.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the snow-covered path, revealing more of the building's facade and the path ahead. A small, colorful advertisement sign becomes visible to the left of the path, near the building. Further down the path, several distant figures (people) emerge, walking away from the viewer. The overall snowy scene and architectural elements remain consistent relative to the evolving perspective.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a snowy urban pathway with a building on the immediate left, featuring large windows and green awnings, alongside a snow-dusted sidewalk containing a couple of advertising stands. To the right, a wide, snow-covered park-like area stretches into the distance, dotted with numerous bare, snow-laden trees, one prominent tree stands in the mid-right foreground, all beneath an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames advance, the viewpoint subtly moves forward, causing more of the building's reflective windows and green awnings to become visible on the left. Concurrently, the prominent tree on the mid-right shifts further left and closer, while the snow-covered path and distant cityscape gradually reveal more of their extent ahead of the viewer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows the viewer on a snow-covered sidewalk, with a modern building featuring large reflective windows and green awnings immediately to their left, and an A-frame sign standing on the sidewalk in front of the building. To the viewer's right, bare trees line a wide, snow-covered park area, with more distant buildings faintly visible through the sparse branches.

end of description

As the viewpoint progresses forward along the path, the building facade and the A-frame sign gradually recede to the left and behind the viewer. The snow-covered path ahead reveals more bare trees lining both the sidewalk to the left and the park to the right, with a distant pedestrian emerging further down the path.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a snowy urban street scene, with a modern building featuring large glass storefronts and green awnings dominating the left side. On the sidewalk directly in front of this building, a white A-frame sign with colorful graphics and text is prominently positioned in the foreground. A partially cleared, snow-dusted sidewalk extends from the center foreground into the distance, lined on its right by several bare-branched trees, with a tall grey streetlamp visible in the mid-ground. To the right, a broad, snow-covered park area with numerous leafless trees and a few benches in the background recedes under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the snowy sidewalk. The initial white A-frame sign recedes to the left and out of view, revealing a second, green-themed A-frame sign further along the path to the left, relative to the initial viewpoint. The streetlamp and trees on the right appear closer as the viewer advances, and new sections of the snow-covered park and the building storefronts further ahead are continuously revealed directly in front of the advancing viewer. Distant pedestrians also become slightly more defined further down the path.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a snow-covered street with a building on the left, featuring large windows and a green store sign near the top; a prominent lamppost stands slightly left of center, leading towards a snow-covered path and park area on the right, where several bare trees and a distant person are visible.
end of description.
The viewpoint slowly moves forward, revealing more of the building's facade on the left and new sections of the snowy path. The initial distant figure on the right continues walking away, eventually exiting the frame, while other pedestrians become visible further along the path as the camera advances.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a snow-covered urban park path on an overcast day. To the viewer's immediate left, a green sandwich board sign, partially covered in snow, displays "SEOUL WALKER" at its base. Further left, a modern building with large windows and a green awning reading "PIG IN THE GARDEN" extends into the midground. A row of bare trees lines the snow-covered path extending directly away from the viewer, with several pedestrians walking into the distance. To the right of the path, a snow-covered landscaped area with more bare trees, a low wooden fence, and a small building is visible, with tall city buildings rising in the background under the gray sky.

end of description

The viewpoint advances along the snow-covered path, causing the green sandwich board sign, initially to the immediate left, to move out of frame entirely to the left. Simultaneously, more of the modern building's facade, previously partially obscured on the viewer's left, becomes visible as the viewer moves past it, revealing further sections of its contemporary architecture. Distant pedestrians and trees on the path appear to get closer before receding, maintaining their forward motion relative to the first frame's distant path, while the park on the right gradually reveals more of its fenced perimeter and trees from the advancing perspective.
