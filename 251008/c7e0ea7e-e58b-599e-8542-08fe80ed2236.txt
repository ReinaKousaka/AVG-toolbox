The first frame depicts a busy street scene with a cobblestone path. In the foreground, large potted plants flank the viewer on both sides. A man wearing a helmet pushes a bicycle towards the viewer from the center-left, while an older man and a woman pulling blue and black suitcases respectively move away from the viewer towards the center-right. The midground and background feature numerous pedestrians walking between multi-story buildings that line both sides of the street under a clear sky.

Over time, the man with the bicycle advances closer to the viewer and slightly left. Concurrently, the two individuals with suitcases recede further into the street, and other pedestrians throughout the midground and background continually shift their positions, altering their proximity to the first-frame viewpoint.
