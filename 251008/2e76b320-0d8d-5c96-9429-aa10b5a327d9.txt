The first frame depicts a bustling city street scene under an overcast sky, with numerous pedestrians. In the immediate foreground to the left, a woman in a white and red top and blue jeans is partially visible, facing away from the viewer. To the center-left, a masked man in a green jacket, a masked younger man in a striped jacket holding a phone, and a masked young woman in a striped top and gray coat walk towards the right. On the right, a tree trunk with sparse foliage and a lamppost are prominent, beside which a masked man checks his phone. In the background, a Taco Bell restaurant, an ornate building with a CaixaBank sign, and a distant white building with a domed roof line the street.

The foreground woman quickly moves out of the frame to the left, while the central group of three pedestrians continues walking right and eventually exits the frame. A person pulling a dark rolling suitcase emerges from the mid-ground, center-right, moving away from the viewer. Subsequently, a small motorized scooter enters the scene from the mid-ground right, proceeding across the street to the left. As these movements occur, more masked pedestrians, including a child in a red jacket, walk into and through the background, and a dark green trash can becomes fully visible at the crosswalk to the right of the street.

The first frame depicts a bustling city street with an overcast sky. To the far right, a masked man in a green jacket is looking at his phone, partially hidden by a dark pole, with a green trash can beside him. On the far left, a masked woman in a white sweater is visible from behind. In the midground, a group of masked pedestrians walk on the sidewalk, moving away from the viewer towards the center-right, while a person on a mobility scooter crosses the street further right. Ornate buildings line the left background, with a wide street and a tall white building extending into the distant right.

As frames progress, the masked man on the far right slowly moves further to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, eventually exiting the scene. Simultaneously, the masked woman on the far left moves away from the viewer and to the left, also departing the visible area. The group of pedestrians in the midground continue walking away from the viewer towards the right side of the first-frame viewpoint, while the person on the mobility scooter proceeds across the street, moving further away and to the right.

In the first frame, the viewer is on a sidewalk with the back of a woman in a white and red sweater in the near left foreground, observing a group of pedestrians, including one on a mobility scooter, walking away towards a mid-ground zebra crossing, flanked by ornate buildings to the left and a wide street with distant structures and a carousel receding to the right.
end of description
Subsequently, the pedestrians continue moving across the street, with the mobility scooter and its occupant nearing the center of the crossing. A new figure pushing a yellow shopping cart emerges from the far left foreground, gradually advancing into the frame towards the mid-ground.
