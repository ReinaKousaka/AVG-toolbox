In the first frame, a stone retaining wall partially covered in green plants runs across the lower foreground, featuring a dark shadow cast from the left. Above this wall, a lush garden with diverse green foliage and various colorful flowers (red, pink, purple) extends across the midground. Dominating the background, slightly to the right of center, is a multi-story traditional wooden house with dark shingled roofs and multiple balconies adorned with red flowers. To the far left, a yellow building with red shutters is partially visible behind and elevated from the main house. A tree with green leaves stands to the right of the main house, and a paved road curves towards the far right, where a house with a red-tiled roof is also visible under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The camera executes a slow, subtle pan to the right, accompanied by a slight zoom out. This movement incrementally reveals more of the yellow building with red shutters, positioned slightly to the left of its initial partial visibility. Simultaneously, further sections of the paved road and an additional red-roofed house become discernible towards the right of the first frame's original boundary. The prominent central wooden house and the tree on the right shift slightly leftward within the frame, exposing previously obscured portions of the garden and background elements respectively. Minor shifts in shadows on the foreground retaining wall are also observable.
