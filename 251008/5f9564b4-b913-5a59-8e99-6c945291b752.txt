The first frame captures an urban sidewalk scene on a sunny day, looking down a street lined with trees and tall buildings. To the viewer's left, a foreground planter with red flowers, a large tree, a bus stop structure, and a bus in the background are visible. On the viewer's right, a modern building with glass windows and a dark entrance extends along the sidewalk, where two people are walking towards the viewer in the center of the path.

As the frames progress, the two people on the sidewalk continue walking towards the viewer, appearing larger and closer in the center of the path. The entire street scene, including the building on the right and the planters and bus on the left, also subtly advances towards the viewer, revealing more of the immediate foreground sidewalk.

The first frame displays a bright city street scene. A wide, light-colored sidewalk extends from the bottom-center towards the middle distance. To the viewer's left, a black metal fence borders a landscaped area with various green plants and some red flowers. Behind this, tree trunks, autumn foliage, and a dark ornate structure are visible, leading to a bustling city street with a green "Delaware Pl." street sign. To the viewer's right, a modern building with large reflective windows and a gray facade dominates, with an entrance door slightly visible at the far right. Two older individuals, a woman in a black jacket and purple top, and a man in a white patterned hoodie and jeans, are walking towards the viewer on the sidewalk in the mid-ground.

The two individuals continue walking directly towards the first-frame viewpoint, progressively growing larger and revealing more detail of their attire. They move from the mid-ground to the foreground, eventually stopping near the left edge of the frame. The man, initially holding a red phone, then slightly turns and points towards the landscaped area to the viewer's left, engaging with the woman as they both look in that direction.

In the first frame, two people stand prominently in the foreground on the left: an older man with glasses wearing a patterned jacket, and a woman with blonde hair and sunglasses, positioned slightly behind him. They are situated next to a black structure resembling a bus shelter, with a planter containing green and red foliage below them. To the right, a modern building with large reflective windows mirrors the street scene, while a sun-dappled sidewalk extends centrally into the midground. In the midground to the left, a street sign for "Ontario St" and a "ONE WAY" sign are visible, leading to a street with distant buildings and trees with autumn leaves, where several pedestrians and vehicles can be seen.
end of description
The two people in the foreground on the left turn and then walk out of frame to the viewer's left. This movement reveals the full bus shelter, a planter, and street signs (Ontario St, ONE WAY) previously partially obscured on the far left. Concurrently, in the midground to the right, a white car pulls up to the curb. A person is then visible standing next to the car, facing the building on the right.

The first frame depicts a sunny city street scene with a lush planter and tree on the far left, a sidewalk extending towards a crosswalk in the mid-ground, and a modern building facade on the right. Tall urban structures and parked vehicles are visible in the distance.
end of description
A person initially standing next to a light blue and white car on the right sidewalk begins walking forward, away from the viewer. Simultaneously, a white SUV previously parked behind the light blue car also starts moving forward into the crosswalk area. The person continues along the sidewalk to the right of the now-moving SUV.

The first frame displays a city street with a planter on the far left foreground. A white SUV and a light blue car are stopped at a midground crosswalk, where a person stands on the right sidewalk. Tall buildings and trees with autumn foliage line the street in the background.

end of description
Subsequently, a black sedan pulls up behind the white SUV at the crosswalk. Later, a second black SUV appears behind the first black sedan, both positioned closer to the viewer than the initial light blue car. Simultaneously, the person on the sidewalk begins to cross the street towards the left, while the white SUV and the black sedan move forward, and the light blue car exits the frame to the far left.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a city street scene with a person standing on the right sidewalk, wearing a light jacket and blue jeans, facing the street. To their right is a utility pole and a building wall. In front of them, a crosswalk stretches across a street where a black sedan, followed by a black SUV, and then a white SUV are stopped, all positioned to the left of the person. On the left, tall city buildings and trees with yellow foliage line the street, while a modern building with dark, reflective architecture and a "BURBERRY" sign is prominent on the right side of the street.
end of description
The black sedan, followed by the black SUV and then the white SUV, move forward across the crosswalk, departing to the left of the initial viewpoint. Subsequently, a gray SUV emerges from the right side of the frame, moving into the street ahead of the stationary person, followed by a silver sedan. The traffic light in the distant background on the left transitions from red to green.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a street scene with a person standing on the right sidewalk near a crosswalk, in front of whom a silver sedan is partially visible on the street. Further left, a gray SUV and a white SUV are stopped on the road, flanked by tall city buildings and autumn trees on the left, and a modern dark-facaded building on the right.
end of description
Subsequently, the silver sedan moves forward, progressively clearing the crosswalk and revealing a driver inside as it drives away from the viewer. The gray SUV, initially positioned further left on the street, also advances slightly, while the person on the right sidewalk subtly shifts their body position.
