The first frame depicts a street scene with several brownstone buildings directly in front, featuring front stoops with black metal railings. Orange, white, and yellow pumpkins and gourds are scattered on these steps and railings, predominantly in the central-left, with a small green-leafed tree positioned in the central foreground, partially obscuring the steps behind it.

As the scene progresses, the viewpoint pans to the right, gradually revealing more of the brownstone building facade on the far right and an air conditioning unit previously less visible on the second building from the left. Simultaneously, the central foreground tree shifts further to the left, exposing more of the decorated steps behind it and a yellow ribbon hanging from the main door in the central-right.
