The first frame displays a wet city street leading towards a distant cityscape under an overcast sky, with tall buildings flanking both sides. Directly overhead, an elevated traffic light structure shows two green lights, a "SW 8 ST" sign, and a 'no right turn' symbol. To the left, a building with a large mural stands near the viewer, with a semi-truck parked further down the street, while to the right, an elevated train track with concrete pillars parallels the road, beyond which a white SUV is visible.

As the viewpoint moves forward, the overhead traffic sign disappears directly above. The semi-truck on the left approaches significantly, its rear door revealing items inside and its side eventually displaying a prominent Pepsi logo. Simultaneously, the white SUV and the elevated train track on the right also become much closer and more detailed.

A large blue Pepsi truck with a red and white logo occupies the immediate left foreground, while a white SUV is parked further down on the right side of a wet city street, leading towards distant skyscrapers and an elevated metro line under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the Pepsi truck passes out of frame to the viewer's left, and the white SUV moves out of frame to the viewer's right. A "Publix" sign on the building to the left and a crosswalk ahead become visible, with construction equipment and orange cones appearing on the left sidewalk. Pedestrians emerge on the left sidewalk, walking towards the viewer from the distance, as a white bus parked further down the street on the right becomes more distinct.

The first frame depicts a wet city street under an overcast sky, extending forward. To the left, a large white building with a 'Pooch' sign is visible, along with palm trees, a person walking near a puddle, and two parked cars (silver and red) on the side. In the mid-ground, a tall modern skyscraper dominates the left-center, while an elevated train track structure with concrete pillars runs parallel to the street on the right. A white bus is stopped beneath the tracks on the right, with green park elements further along the road.
end of description
The viewer advances steadily forward along the wet road. The walking person on the far left moves out of frame, while the parked silver and red cars on the left appear progressively closer relative to the first-frame viewpoint, and a dark grey car is revealed just in front of them. Concurrently, the white bus on the right side of the street also moves closer and further along the road towards the viewer's initial destination. A subtle change occurs on the building sign, transforming from 'Pooch' to 'P-PARK' to the left of the viewer.
