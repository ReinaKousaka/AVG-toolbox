The first frame displays a paved road stretching forward, flanked on the left by a stone wall topped with a pedestrian path and railing, and on the right by a metal guardrail, both leading towards a canopy of trees. Beyond these, a distant valley with rolling green hills is visible under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the road, stone wall, and guardrail recede and shift towards the sides, relative to their initial positions. The distant valley and hills, initially ahead, appear closer and more detailed, while the overhead trees pass above the viewer. A small white car briefly becomes visible further down the road, ahead of the viewer's original location.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The viewer is on a paved road extending into the midground, flanked by a stone retaining wall on the immediate left and a metal guardrail on the immediate right, both beneath overhead trees. A '30' speed limit sign is positioned to the right of the guardrail, with misty green mountains visible in the distant background.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the overhead trees recede, and the stone wall and guardrail move towards and past the viewer, revealing a wooden house with a balcony emerging from the upper left. Concurrently, the '30' sign moves off-screen right, revealing a caution sign further right and providing a clearer view of the distant, fog-covered green mountains.

A paved road curving left occupies the lower half, flanked by a multi-story building with balconies on the left and a metal guardrail with a large green tree on the right, overlooking a green valley with a utility pole and distant, mist-covered mountains under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the building on the viewer's left moves backward and to the left, while the guardrail and tree on the right pass by, revealing more of the valley ahead. The utility pole and its streetlamp shift further to the right of the original view, and additional structures within the valley become progressively clearer to the front-right of the initial scene as the road continues its descent and turn.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a paved road leading uphill and curving left, with a multi-story white building featuring dark balconies and windows, alongside large rocks, occupying the left side. To the right, a metal railing borders a drop-off, beyond which green, forested mountains partially shrouded in clouds are visible under an overcast sky, with a street lamp and a utility pole displaying a red sign positioned near the railing.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the utility pole and street lamp on the right of the road progressively shift out of view to the far right of the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, more of the metal railing and newly revealed benches become visible further to the right of the road. The building on the left comes closer to the viewer, exposing more architectural details and revealing additional buildings and hillside vegetation further up and to the left of the original perspective.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a paved road curving gently to the right, leading into the distance. To the immediate left, a white multi-story building with dark wooden balconies and an ornate window grill is prominent, with a large rock on the sidewalk at the bottom left. Further left, other buildings and dense greenery ascend a steep hill. To the right, a metal railing borders the road, with two rustic wooden benches near the viewer and views of a valley below. In the background, verdant rolling mountains are visible under an overcast sky, with some peaks partially obscured by clouds.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the initial white building on the left recedes, revealing more of the stone retaining wall and climbing vegetation along the hillside. Concurrently, the two wooden benches on the right move out of frame, and the metal railing extends further, revealing more of the valley and distant rooftops below the first-frame viewpoint. The street light pole on the right side of the road, initially in the mid-ground, draws closer, and a red traffic sign becomes visible further down the road on the right.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A paved road, marked by a white line on the right, curves gently uphill and left into the distance. To the left, a stone retaining wall supports a building with a brown roof, partially visible above lush greenery, and a garage opening below, while to the right, a metal guardrail extends, overlooking a valley town with a tall street light in the mid-ground. Green, tree-covered mountains rise in the background under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the stone retaining wall and the building on the left approach, revealing more of their lower structures and new white wall sections. Concurrently, the street light and guardrail on the right pass by, appearing to shift left relative to their first-frame position, and a red and blue 'no parking' sign becomes clearly visible below the street light. The distant valley town and green mountains remain in their background positions as the immediate foreground changes.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a paved road curving gently to the left, flanked by a prominent stone retaining wall on the left, which supports a steep, vegetated slope with several wooden chalets. To the right, a sidewalk and a metal railing overlook distant green, mountainous terrain under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the stone wall and chalets on the left recede from the initial position, and a white wall previously visible at the top-left moves out of view. A streetlamp and a red and white striped warning sign, initially further ahead in the first frame, draw closer to the viewer's central path. Finally, two wooden benches are newly revealed on the sidewalk to the right, gradually coming into full view as the scene progresses.
