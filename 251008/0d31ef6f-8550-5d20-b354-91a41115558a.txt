First, a large, light-colored cylindrical vehicle occupies the immediate foreground left, partially obscuring a wet city street with cars, a barrier, and an illuminated modern skyscraper on the far left. To the right, older buildings line the street, topped by a partially visible blue overhead street sign beneath a bright streetlamp.
end of description
As the frames progress, the foreground vehicle moves left and out of view, revealing more of the street, barrier, and pavement markings to the left. The camera advances along the road, bringing the blue overhead street sign fully into view on the right, which now clearly displays destinations and distances like "BELLAGIO SHANGHAI" and "LANDMARK CENTER."

The first frame presents a nighttime city street from a forward-facing perspective, featuring a multi-lane road leading towards distant illuminated buildings. To the background center-left are two tall, dark high-rises, one prominently displaying "GOLDEN TULIP", while a cylindrical building with horizontal light strips stands on the far left. On the right, an older brick building lines the street, displaying a "Café de Flore" sign at its base, with yellow bikes parked on the sidewalk, and a blue street sign and traffic lights are visible overhead.
end of description.
Over subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward and to the right, revealing more of the older building on the right. The blue street sign overhead in the center-right changes its text from "江西中路" (Jiangxi Zhong Lu) to "江西北路" (Jiangxi Bei Lu), and the traffic lights on the right transition from green to red. The white car in the foreground-left and the red car in the central lane move forward, while pedestrians on the sidewalks also change positions.

The first frame depicts a nighttime city intersection under a dark, cloudy sky. In the foreground, a zebra crossing spans the street, with a white car positioned on the left and a person running right to left across the road on the far right. Stretching into the midground and background, a street is lined with buildings; on the left, a modern complex with the "GOLDEN TULIP" sign stands tall alongside more distant skyscrapers, while on the right, a brick building with illuminated windows and a traffic light (showing red) is visible.
end of description
The white car on the left and the running person in the foreground begin to move forward and left, respectively. Subsequently, the traffic light on the right changes from red to green. A dark SUV then enters the left foreground, following the white car as it continues its movement forward and the runner exits the frame to the far left. More vehicles in the midground also progress further down the illuminated street.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a night city street scene. In the foreground, a wet asphalt road with white crosswalk lines and arrows stretches forward, with a silver car with headlights approaching from the left of center and a red car further down the road. To the left, a multi-story building with a "GOLDEN TULIP" sign is visible, flanked by a taller skyscraper, while on the right, a brick-colored building lines the street with rows of yellow shared bicycles on the sidewalk. A green traffic light is suspended above the right side of the road, and additional towering skyscrapers pierce the dark night sky in the background.
end of description
As the video progresses, the silver car on the left moves steadily closer to the viewer, while the red car in the distance also advances further down the street. The green traffic light, positioned above the right side of the road, changes to red. Concurrently, pedestrians on the right sidewalk continue walking further into the scene.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, the viewer looks down a city street at night. The wet asphalt road with white arrow markings (a left turn and a straight arrow) is directly in front, bordered by a curb and a small tree on the left, and a gray barrier on the right. In the midground, a red car with tail lights is centered on the road, with a multi-story building featuring a "GOLDEN TULIP" sign to the left and a brick building with illuminated windows to the right. A blue street sign, reading "Changding Branch Rd," hangs over the street to the right. Two figures walk on the sidewalk to the far right. In the background, taller skyscrapers rise into the dark sky, with a blue illuminated screen visible further down the street.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The red car in the distant midground gradually approaches, becoming larger relative to the viewer. The "Changding Branch Rd" street sign, initially to the right and above the road, moves upwards and to the left relative to the frame, eventually disappearing from view. Simultaneously, the two figures on the right sidewalk move closer to the viewer, then pass out of frame to the right. The Golden Tulip building on the left recedes and moves leftward, while the brick building on the right becomes more prominent and fills more of the frame from its original position as the viewer advances into the scene.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a night-time city street from a low-angle viewpoint on the road. Tall buildings flank both sides, with a multi-story light brown building on the left and a reddish-brown brick building on the right, both illuminated by internal and external lights. A wide road with white arrows and a crosswalk stretches into the distance, leading to modern skyscrapers visible centrally between the flanking buildings. A red car is in the mid-ground moving away from the viewer, while pedestrians walk on both sidewalks, and a red fire hydrant stands in the right foreground.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly moves forward, causing the street markings and fire hydrant to recede slightly. The red car continues to move further into the distance down the street. A person on a bicycle becomes visible on the left sidewalk, also moving away from the first-frame viewpoint. Pedestrians on both sides continue their movement further along the sidewalks relative to the initial position.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a nighttime street lined by two multi-story buildings; a light-colored, modern structure is on the left, and an older, darker facade building is on the right, both warmly illuminated. In the foreground lies a wide crosswalk, with a street lamp on the left and a yellow cautionary sign on the right; in the distance, between the buildings, skyscrapers rise under a dark sky, and red car taillights are visible. A lone pedestrian walks on the right sidewalk, while a person on a bicycle is on the far left. end of description.
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street, making the buildings on both sides appear closer and revealing more of their lower levels. The person on the bicycle exits the scene to the left, and the initial pedestrian walks past to the right, replaced by new pedestrians appearing further down the right sidewalk. The yellow sign also gradually moves upwards and out of the top right of the frame.
