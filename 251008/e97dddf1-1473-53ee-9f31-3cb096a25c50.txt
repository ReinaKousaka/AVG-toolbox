The first frame depicts a rainy street scene from a sidewalk perspective, with a metal fence in the foreground right and a wet paved sidewalk extending left, where a person in a yellow jacket and black umbrella walks away from the viewer. Several tree trunks stand in the midground center, separating the sidewalk from the wet road on the right, where a red bus is stopped at an intersection with a red traffic light, amidst other vehicles and pedestrians. Lush green foliage covers a hillside in the background left, with faint buildings visible through the rain in the background right.

Throughout the following frames, the pedestrians on the sidewalk, including the person in the yellow jacket and a newly visible woman in shorts and light boots carrying a grey umbrella, continuously move forward and away from the first-frame viewpoint. The red bus on the road in the midground remains largely stationary relative to its initial position, while heavy rain persists across the entire scene.

The first frame depicts a rainy street scene: a person with an umbrella walks forward in the foreground left on a wet sidewalk, next to a prominent tree trunk and a gray pole on the right. Further along, several people with umbrellas walk away on the mid-left sidewalk, adjacent to a wet road with a red bus and cars stopped at a traffic light in the mid-right.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint gradually shifts left and slightly forward. The initial foreground person moves further left and eventually out of the frame, revealing more of the wet sidewalk and the group of pedestrians receding into the distance to the left. Concurrently, the tree and pole on the right move out of view, exposing more of the parked cars on the road, which remain to the right of the original central axis.

The first frame presents a rainy street scene with a wet sidewalk and a black metal fence running along the right side towards the viewer. On the left sidewalk, three individuals holding black umbrellas walk towards the viewer, backed by a lush green, treed slope, while a red bus and several cars are visible on the distant wet road to the right.

Subsequently, the three pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue advancing closer to the viewer. A bicycle, initially partially obscured by a tree trunk near the fence on the mid-right, gradually becomes more distinct as it remains chained there. Simultaneously, the red bus and cars on the street to the right begin to move forward relative to their initial positions.
