frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame captures a road leading into a valley, flanked by mountains and a village. A white camper van drives towards the viewer on the left side of the road, which is bordered by a green grassy slope and a steep, tree-covered mountain range with rocky peaks. Further down the road on the left, a green truck is visible. On the right, a wooden fence parallels the road, alongside a large yellow hotel ('Miramonti') with balconies, and a darker building behind it with a black SUV parked in front.
end of description
The white camper van, initially approaching on the left side of the road, passes directly beside the viewer and then recedes behind them. As the viewer moves forward, the yellow Miramonti hotel and the wooden fence on the right progressively transition from being to the viewer's immediate right to receding behind them, revealing more of the darker building and the parked black SUV. Concurrently, a prominent streetlight on the left and the green truck further ahead also pass the viewer. The distant village houses on the left and center become more defined in the foreground as the scene unfolds.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame captures a paved road extending forward, flanked on the left by grassy slopes and traditional houses nestled against a forested mountain range with rocky, partially snow-capped peaks. On the immediate right, a multi-story building with wooden balconies dominates, with a car's rear visible at the extreme bottom right, all beneath a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the building on the right recedes and exits the frame, revealing more of a wooden fence and a parked black SUV ahead on the right. Simultaneously, a pedestrian crossing sign and a streetlight emerge on the left, advancing towards and then passing the viewer, while more houses become visible further down the road. Further into the scene, another dark car approaches from the distant road ahead, and more distinct snow-capped mountain peaks become visible in the far background to the right of the valley's center.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a paved road extending directly away from the viewer into a valley surrounded by mountains. To the left, a low stone wall borders houses and a forested mountain rising steeply in the background. To the right, a wooden fence separates the road from a large empty lot with a dark van parked, behind which stands a wooden-sided building and more distant, snow-capped rocky peaks. A dark car is visible in the left lane, farther down the road, as heavy clouds fill the sky overhead.
end of description
A dark car on the left side of the road initially moves closer to the viewer, then passes to the lower-left out of the frame. Simultaneously, a new dark car enters the scene from the right foreground, pulling into the parking area. This car continues deeper into the parking lot, moving past the viewer's right side, eventually revealing a previously obscured dark van, before exiting the frame towards the background.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a two-lane road with white markings stretching into the distance, flanked by a low stone wall and multi-story buildings on the left, and a wooden fence with an evergreen tree on the right. Towering, forested, snow-capped mountains loom behind the buildings to the left, while other rugged peaks are visible in the distance to the right, all beneath an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The stone wall and buildings on the left, including a red-and-yellow banner and a streetlamp, progressively approach and then recede towards the viewer's left. Concurrently, the wooden fence and the evergreen tree on the right approach and then move out of view to the right, revealing more of the white building and distant mountains. This motion continuously reveals new sections of the road and the surrounding mountainous valley ahead of the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
A paved road with white dashed center lines and solid white edge lines extends into the distance, curving slightly right, in front of the viewer. To the immediate left, a multi-story building with white walls and numerous wooden balconies and trim dominates, with a smaller building partially visible behind it, all set against a towering, snow-capped mountain. To the right, another multi-story white building with dark windows and wooden balconies is partially obscured by foliage, with a rustic wooden fence running along the roadside in front of it. Further in the background, more green mountains rise under a cloudy sky.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses forward along the road, causing the initial buildings on both sides to recede and shift upwards in the frame, revealing more of the road ahead. A blue pedestrian crossing sign initially to the right moves centrally on the right side, and a pedestrian crossing appears on the road directly in front of the viewer. As the camera advances, the large tree on the far right moves out of view, and new buildings further down the street become visible on both the left and right sides of the road. The distant mountains remain visible, with their relative positions slightly shifting as the foreground passes by.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A road extends forward between multi-story buildings with wooden balconies on the left and right, leading to a mountainous valley in the background with snow-capped peaks under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the initial left building recedes, revealing a larger white building further left and new purple flags appear beside it. Concurrently, the right building moves further right, exposing more of a roadside guardrail and revealing a white van parked further to its right. The distant, snow-capped mountains in the background gradually become clearer as the view progresses into the valley ahead.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a road ascending slightly into a mountainous valley under a cloudy sky. In the immediate foreground, a paved road with white lane markings recedes into the distance. To the left, a light-colored building with wooden upper stories and three purple banners stands beside a green slope leading to a densely forested mountain with snow-capped peaks at the far upper left. To the right, a grassy verge with a wooden barrier transitions to a multi-story building with balconies and parked vehicles, set against a backdrop of trees and distant snow-dusted mountains.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the initial building and purple banners on the left, along with the close wooden barrier on the right, progressively recede from view. Subsequently, new white and red traffic barriers, a lower brown wooden building, a street lamp, and a red fire hydrant are revealed on the left side of the road. Simultaneously, a large leafy tree on the right moves out of frame, revealing a pedestrian crossing sign, a smaller chalet-style building, a white SUV, and a digital sign displaying "13:00" and "20Â°C" on the right. A pedestrian crossing then becomes visible directly ahead on the road.
