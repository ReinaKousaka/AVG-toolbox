The first frame depicts a blue carpeted path, bordered on the left by a glass-walled building decorated with blue snowflakes and on the right by a white railing adorned with white garland and blue snowflakes. In the midground, various people walk on the blue path, including a small child moving away from the viewer, while a raised black platform populated by more individuals, a large evergreen tree, and a clear dome structure are visible further in the background. end of description
As the frames progress, the child on the blue path continues to walk away from the viewer, moving further into the scene, and a group of people on the left side approaches and then passes the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, a red "EXIT" sign on the glass building on the left becomes more distinctly visible, while other people across the scene show subtle shifts in their positions.
