In the first frame, a black lamppost stands slightly left of center in the foreground. To the left, a sidewalk runs past a building with wall sconces, and further back, a "PARKING" sign is visible on a red brick building. A dark pickup truck is parked on the street in the midground, with a tall, multi-story building to the right of the lamppost, beyond which a parking lot with several cars is visible on the right, partially obscured by green foliage.
end of description
The green foliage on the far right gradually recedes, revealing a brown trash can in the parking lot to the right. A person then emerges from behind the lamppost, walking right towards the parking lot. Concurrently, the pickup truck on the street begins to move away from the viewer to the left, revealing a red car parked further down the street behind its initial position.

The first frame captures a city street scene with a black pole prominently positioned in the foreground to the right of the viewer. To the left, a concrete sidewalk with small trees and decorative brickwork extends into the distance, bordered by a multi-story building with windows and wall-mounted lights. On the street in front of the viewer, a dark grey pickup truck is present. To the right, a tall building with a light-colored facade, windows, an arched entrance, and a street lamp dominates, with a parking area containing several cars and green bushes further to its right, where a person is visible. In the background, an overcast sky and distant buildings, including a red brick building with a partial "PARKIN" sign, are seen.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the black pole on the right moves further right, eventually exiting the frame, revealing more of the street and the building facade. Concurrently, the dark grey pickup truck continues driving away from the viewer down the street. A pedestrian on the right sidewalk walks towards the building's arched entrance, and another pedestrian appears from behind the retreating pole, also proceeding towards the building on the right. The overall viewpoint subtly shifts forward and right.

The first frame captures a downtown street scene looking forward, with a multi-story brick building featuring decorative lamps and storefronts along a sidewalk on the left. On the right, a tall stone building with many windows and a lamppost borders another sidewalk; a dark grey pickup truck and a white car behind it are positioned in the street between the sidewalks, both facing away from the viewer. In the mid-distance background, more buildings are visible, including one with a dome and a "PARK" sign.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the dark grey pickup truck and the white car behind it slowly advance further down the street, incrementally moving away from the viewer's original position.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a street scene is viewed from a sidewalk. To the viewer's left, a light-colored building with large windows displaying a QR code and text is visible, adorned with several black sconce lights. A row of small green trees lines the sidewalk further down the street, with a white car in the mid-ground beyond them. To the right, a dark gray Ford pickup truck is on the street in front of a multi-story brick building featuring ornate stone details, many windows, and a prominent street lamp.
end of description
Chronologically, the dark gray Ford pickup truck in the mid-right steadily moves forward, exiting the frame towards the right by the final image. Simultaneously, the white car in the mid-ground also advances further down the street. As the pickup truck departs, a person in a blue shirt is newly revealed sitting in the truck bed in the last two frames, previously obscured.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a street scene from a ground-level perspective. To the viewer's immediate left, part of a building facade is visible, featuring large windows with a prominent QR code poster and several ornate wall-mounted light fixtures extending into the midground. A sidewalk runs along this building. In the midground, a street parallels the sidewalk, with a white car parked facing away from the viewer. To the viewer's immediate right, a tree with green foliage partially obscures the view. Further right, an ornate stone building with arched windows and doorways extends into the background. A small section of a dark vehicle is visible at the bottom far right. The sky overhead is light and overcast.
end of description
The viewer moves forward and slightly to the right of the initial viewpoint. The large tree at the foreground right gradually shifts right out of the frame, revealing a new lamppost and more of the ornate building's facade and entrances to its right. The dark vehicle at the bottom right of the first frame quickly moves out of view to the right. The building on the left recedes as the viewer progresses, showing more of its length and additional ornate wall sconces. The white car on the street remains parked ahead of the viewer but appears slightly further away and shifts slightly left relative to the changing frame center. Red "PARKING" banners further down the street on the left become more distinctly visible as the viewer approaches them.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a city street extends into the background under an overcast sky. To the left, a building with large windows and wall-mounted lamps parallels a concrete sidewalk lined with small trees and a red 'PARKING' banner further back. To the right, another ornate stone building stands across the street, where a white car is partially visible in the mid-ground.
end of description
The viewpoint then shifts forward and slightly to the right relative to the initial position. This movement causes the nearest tree to move further left within the frame, while more of the street ahead and the full front of a white SUV are revealed further down the road from its original partial view.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a city sidewalk scene, with a building featuring '21st Mortgage Corporation' and wall-mounted lanterns to the viewer's left. A small tree stands in the foreground between the sidewalk and the street, which extends into the distance, revealing a 'PARKING' sign and another street lamp further down.
end of description
Subsequently, a white car emerges from the far right of the street, driving leftward past the foreground tree. Its movement gradually reveals a tan building with arched windows and a street lamp across the street, further to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, as the car continues off-screen to the far left.
