The first frame shows a wet city street and sidewalk on an overcast day. A building with large windows and some foliage is immediately to the viewer's right, while a short metal fence is to the left on the sidewalk. On the street, a blue bus and a yellow taxi, along with other cars, are moving away from the viewer, paralleling two pedestrians with umbrellas walking on the central sidewalk towards the distant skyscrapers.
end of description.
In subsequent frames, these two pedestrians continue walking away along the central sidewalk, moving further into the midground as vehicles on the street also recede. Eventually, the left pedestrian lowers their umbrella and turns to face the viewer, now positioned further away from the initial viewpoint.
