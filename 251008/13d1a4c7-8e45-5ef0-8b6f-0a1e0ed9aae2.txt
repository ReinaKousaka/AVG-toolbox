In the first frame, a gray asphalt road extends forward from the viewer, with white lane markings on both sides. To the left, a black car moves forward, and further down the road, tall, modern buildings rise under a cloudy sky, with an underpass entrance visible below them. On the right, a light-colored building with multiple windows stands alongside a sidewalk, where a speed limit sign (40 km/h), a bus stop sign, and three individuals with bicycles are visible, one of whom is riding a green bicycle further to the right.

end of description

A person on a green bicycle enters from the far right sidewalk and rides left, passing a group of two stationary cyclists, who then also move forward and left relative to their first-frame position. Simultaneously, a black car on the left lane moves forward and exits the frame to the left. The speed limit and bus stop signs, initially on the right sidewalk, move out of frame to the right as the viewer proceeds. Consequently, new sections of the right sidewalk and the lower part of the light-colored building are revealed, along with more of the traffic light and red-and-white barrier on the left road median, which become more prominent as the viewer approaches them.

The first frame shows an empty city street extending forward, flanked by a concrete barrier with red and white stripes and a traffic light on the left, and a large, light-grey building with columns and a blue arrow sign on the right. Further down the street on the left, tall modern buildings and an underpass are visible, while more multi-story buildings and a tree line the curving street ahead on the right. end of description.
As the viewpoint moves forward, the traffic light and barrier arm on the left recede and are replaced by a pole with circular regulatory signs, while an orange street bin briefly appears on the left sidewalk. Simultaneously, more signs (yellow diamond, 'P', 'Taxi') emerge under the building on the right, and a person walks into view on the right sidewalk, moving from the distance towards the viewer before exiting to the right.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a city street curving slightly left ahead, flanked by a low stone wall on the left and a sidewalk on the right. To the right, a multi-story building houses a storefront with a dark facade, a large round logo, and red signs, while higher floors show shutters, with a tree branch and a "No Entry" sign visible at the far right. In the distance to the left, tall modern buildings, including a skyscraper and a construction crane, are seen under an overcast sky, with two cars on the road ahead.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the street, the right-side building housing the Leica store approaches closer, its signage becoming more prominent and shifting left within the frame. Simultaneously, the distant skyscraper and other cityscape elements also appear to draw nearer, indicating a continuous forward motion of the viewer relative to the initial position.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a gray paved city street extending into the distance, with a light-colored skyscraper and a red construction crane visible in the far background to the left. To the immediate right, a multi-story building with an orange top section and a dark storefront featuring two red "Leica" logos and an advertisement poster lines the street. On the left, a stone wall borders a construction site.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the advertisement poster on the right building changes themes; the red "Leica" logos then disappear, and a red and white striped barrier emerges above the poster, which subsequently retracts to reveal an open garage entrance on the right. Simultaneously, a blue "One Way" sign and a "No Entry" sign become fully visible on a pole that was partially obscured on the far left. People walking on the right sidewalk progressively move closer to, then past, the now-open garage entrance.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a grey asphalt road extends into the distance, marked by a white arrow on the lower left. On the far right, a person in a white t-shirt walks away from the viewer, entering a large, open garage within a multi-story building that lines the right side of the road. To the left, a low stone wall and a construction site with a prominent red crane are visible, leading to a tall, modern white skyscraper dominating the background. A black car is parked further down the road, and a group of pedestrians is walking on the right-hand sidewalk in the mid-distance, away from the viewer.
end of description
The person on the far right continues into the garage entrance and moves out of view. Concurrently, the group of pedestrians on the right sidewalk advances towards the viewer, revealing a yellow bus stop sign behind them. A man, a woman in blue, and a child in red are now prominent as they walk closer, while a red traffic light activates in the distant center, beyond the black car.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a city street viewed from a low angle, with a paved road leading directly away from the viewer. A black car is positioned ahead in the center of the road, and a sidewalk with a few pedestrians and a bus stop sign is to the viewer's right. On the right, a multi-story building with large windows runs parallel to the viewer, while to the left, a construction site with a large red crane is visible behind a concrete wall. Further down the road, a tall white skyscraper with many windows dominates the left-center background.
end of description
The black car ahead illuminates its brake lights. Concurrently, the traffic light located further down the road, to the left of the car, changes from green to red. The pedestrians on the sidewalk to the right continue walking forward, moving slightly further away from the initial viewpoint.
