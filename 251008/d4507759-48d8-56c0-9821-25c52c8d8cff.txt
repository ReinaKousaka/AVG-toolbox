In the first frame, the viewer faces a snow-dusted road with yellow pedestrian crosswalk markings leading into a village. To the immediate right, two people walk away on a snowy sidewalk, next to a light-colored building with a snow-covered roof. On the left, a white building displaying "MAB" signs and flags (Swiss, red, yellow) stands beside snow-covered bushes and a bare tree, with a red building visible further down the street. Snow-capped mountains rise in the background, with the sky appearing pale and overcast, and a street lamp arching from the left foreground.
end of description
The viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the two people on the right and the "MAB" building on the left to recede and exit the frame. The buildings flanking the road become more prominent and detailed as the viewer approaches, revealing new sections of their facades and the streetscape between them. A black car parked on the right side of the road is revealed further ahead, while the distant snow-covered mountains remain in the background as the scene opens slightly.
