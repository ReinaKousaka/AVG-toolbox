The first frame reveals a bright, open-plan room from a doorway, centered by a woman with outstretched arms. To her left, a grey armchair sits beside a glass table holding books and a vase with orange flowers, while to her right, a reflective console table supports a television. Behind her, a modern kitchen island with bar stools and a dining area with an oval table and chairs lead to glass patio doors opening to a garden.

The woman subsequently turns and walks away from the viewer, moving towards the back of the room. As she advances, more of the kitchen island, the dining area, and the garden through the glass doors are progressively revealed to the left and center. The initial armchair moves partially out of frame to the viewer's left, and a doorway on the far right wall, leading to another room, becomes visible.
