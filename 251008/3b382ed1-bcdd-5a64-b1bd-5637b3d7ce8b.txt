The first frame shows a wet, tree-lined path or road stretching into a misty, rainy distance. On the left, a sidewalk with a bench and a grassy area with a green fence are visible, while on the right, a low bush barrier, a red brick wall with a green fence, and a streetlight pole line the path. Two blurry figures, one with an umbrella, are walking away from the viewer in the far distance along the path.

In the following frames, the two figures on the path continue to move further away from the viewer, receding deeper into the rain and mist until they are barely perceptible. The consistent rainfall creates visible splashes on the wet ground throughout the scene.

The first frame depicts a wet, rainy outdoor scene with a paved path extending into the distance from the viewer's perspective. Two yellow lines run down the middle of the path, which is flanked by a grey sidewalk and green bushes on the left, and more green bushes fronting a brick wall with green metal fencing on the right. Tall trees line the left side, while a street lamp post stands near the viewer on the right, and a dark bench is visible further down on the left, with a blurry figure receding into the misty background.
end of description
Throughout the frames, visible raindrops continuously fall and create splashes on the heavily wet path, indicating ongoing heavy rain. A dark-clad figure, initially visible in the misty background on the path's left side, slowly recedes further into the distance away from the viewer across the subsequent frames. No new objects or scenes are revealed, with the environment remaining static except for the persistent rainfall and the distant figure's movement.

The first frame presents a wet, wide outdoor path extending into a misty distance, bordered on the left by green bushes, a prominent tree trunk, and a distant dark park bench. To the right, a long brick wall topped with a green metal fence runs parallel, also fronted by green bushes, while the path's right side contains visible muddy standing water and the center features two yellow tactile paving strips.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, heavy rain continues to fall, causing the standing water on the right side of the path to visibly deepen and expand. A person holding an umbrella slowly walks away from the viewer in the mid-ground on the left side of the path, passing the bench. A "Rain Everyday" watermark appears in the bottom left corner starting from the third frame.
