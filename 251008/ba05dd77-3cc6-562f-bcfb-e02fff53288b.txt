The first frame shows a dirt path leading into the mid-ground towards distant buildings, flanked by green grassy slopes. On the left mid-ground, a wooden bench sits on a slope, with dark trees and towering mountains beyond. A utility pole stands center-left in the mid-ground, while on the right, covered bales are visible on a grassy hill, with more mountains in the distant background. A partly cloudy sky dominates the upper half, with the sun breaking through on the top right.

As the viewer moves forward along the path, the wooden bench on the left moves out of frame, replaced by a closer view of a wooden fence alongside the path. The utility pole and the buildings ahead appear closer, while on the right, the covered bales become larger and clearer, with a prominent white bale further revealed to the right of the path. Additionally, numerous small white specks begin to flutter across the left side of the frame near the trees and grass.

**First frame description:** A dirt path extends forward uphill, flanked on the left by a grassy slope with a prominent utility pole and a wooden fence line, and on the right by a wider grassy hill where a partially covered white object rests in the lower corner. In the midground, several dark-roofed buildings cluster at the path's end, with distant mountains and a cloudy sky, brightened by sunlight on the right, forming the background.
end of description.
As the viewer moves forward, the utility pole on the left and the covered white object on the right gradually move out of view to the viewer's left and right, respectively. Concurrently, the buildings ahead and a small white structure on the right side of the path grow larger and closer to the viewer. A substantial stack of logs covered by green tarps emerges on the left side of the path, next to the buildings, having been previously obscured by the initial position of the utility pole.
