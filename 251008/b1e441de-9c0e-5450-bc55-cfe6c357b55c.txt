The first frame displays a wet, tree-lined pedestrian path during rainfall, extending into a misty background. To the immediate left, green bushes are in the foreground, with a light pole bearing a yellow triangular sign positioned behind them, adjacent to a black metal fence running alongside a wet road. A row of green-leaved trees lines the left side, paralleling the road. Centrally, a paved path with a prominent red stripe runs into the distance, bordered on the right by a low red brick wall topped with green fencing, behind which dense trees are visible.

The viewpoint slowly advances forward along the paved path. The initial light pole and foreground bushes on the far left progressively move out of frame as the viewer passes them. Simultaneously, new sections of the black metal fence and the row of trees further along the path on the left are revealed, becoming closer. On the right, more of the red brick wall, its green fencing, and the dense trees behind it become visible as the viewer moves deeper into the scene.

In the first frame, a wet paved sidewalk with a black metal fence runs along the left side, paralleling a street with trees and small planter beds. To the viewer's right, a red path extends into the distance, bordered by a brick wall topped with a green metal fence, behind which a dense line of trees stands. The background appears misty and hazy, with a faint red object visible far down the street on the left.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the red path. The previously unseen segments of the red path and the adjacent sidewalk directly ahead of the first-frame viewpoint gradually become visible. More of the fence on the left and the brick wall on the right, extending further into the distance from their initial positions, are revealed. The distant red object on the street to the left of the viewer approaches closer relative to the advancing viewpoint.

The first frame shows a rainy street scene. To the viewer's left, a black metal fence borders a wet road. Running parallel to the viewer, a sidewalk with several green-leafed trees and small green bushes separates the fence from a red paved path on the viewer's right. Further right, a low brick wall topped with a green fence lines the path, behind which dense green foliage is visible. The road and distant areas are obscured by rain and mist.
end of description
In subsequent frames, a person with a blue umbrella on a bicycle or scooter appears on the road to the left of the viewer, moving away into the distance. A black car then emerges on the wet road to the viewer's left, following the cyclist and also driving away. Finally, a lighter-colored car follows behind the black car, also traveling away from the first-frame viewpoint on the left side of the road.
