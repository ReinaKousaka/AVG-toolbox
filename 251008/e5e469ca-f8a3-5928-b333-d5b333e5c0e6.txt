A paved road stretches into the distance under a clear sky, flanked by buildings, numerous tall palm trees, and parked vehicles. On the left, a white car and a black car are visible along the curb, while a black convertible is parked on the right, partially obscured by a tree trunk and a lamppost. Buildings with green awnings and a distant hillside topped with houses line the left side, adding to the urban landscape.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the street. The black convertible on the right, initially partially visible, gradually comes into full view and then exits the frame to the right. As it passes, a black SUV, then a white SUV, and finally a white sedan, previously further down the road, are successively revealed parked along the right curb. These newly revealed vehicles then also begin to shift towards the right edge of the frame as the camera continues its forward progression.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a paved road extending forward from the bottom center, flanked by parked cars on both sides. On the right, a white SUV is partially visible in the foreground, with a row of parked vehicles and buildings beyond it. To the left, more parked cars and buildings with green awnings are present, all beneath a clear sky filled with numerous tall palm trees lining the street into the distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, parked vehicles on the right successively move out of view, revealing new cars like a dark SUV with a roof tent and later a gold sedan. Concurrently, a red golf cart appears on the left and recedes, while a blue sign also becomes visible further down the left side. The street and buildings on both sides progressively reveal more of their length as the viewer advances through the scene.

The first frame displays a street scene with the viewer positioned on the road, looking forward. The asphalt road, marked with white dashed lines, occupies the lower half of the frame. To the immediate right, a light-colored car is partially visible, with a dark SUV parked further ahead. On the right side, there's a sidewalk, green shrubbery, a street light pole, and white Mediterranean-style buildings with arched windows. To the left, a dark SUV is parked, followed by other cars, green foliage, white buildings, and a blue "Sotheby's" sign. Both sides of the street are lined with numerous tall palm trees extending into the distance, beneath a clear blue sky with sparse clouds.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the light-colored car and the dark SUV initially parked on the immediate right in the first frame pass by, eventually moving behind and to the left of the original viewpoint. A black SUV that was initially further ahead on the right also comes into full view and then moves past. New architectural details and signage like "PUMA PALACE" become visible on the buildings to the right, which were previously further ahead of the first-frame viewpoint. The long avenue of palm trees and distant buildings continue to unfold as the viewer proceeds forward along the street.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a street scene looking down a road, with a long line of tall palm trees receding into the distance on both sides. White, Mediterranean-style buildings with parked cars line the street to the left and right of the viewer, with a large green bush visible in the immediate bottom right.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the street, causing the buildings, parked cars, and foliage on both sides to shift from being ahead and to the viewer's sides to passing behind them. On the right, a streetlamp adorned with a "WSL FINALS" banner becomes increasingly prominent and closer before moving past. New sections of the white buildings and additional parked vehicles come into view ahead on both the left and right as the viewer advances. Finally, a yellow parking meter or post emerges from the right foreground as the journey continues down the sunlit street.

First, the viewpoint is positioned on a street looking forward, with a dark asphalt road featuring white dividing and shoulder lines. To the left, a white pickup and an SUV are parked beside buildings with blue awnings and a continuous line of tall palm trees receding into the distance. To the right, several white SUVs are parked alongside a sidewalk with green trees, a lamppost, and white Spanish-style buildings adorned with archways. The sky above is clear blue with sparse clouds.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, parked vehicles on both sides gradually move out of frame as they are passed. A light-colored SUV on the right moves past, followed by a dark blue sedan coming into view from behind it. Simultaneously, a white sedan on the left drives towards and then passes the viewer's left side. The buildings on both sides become more detailed, and a '30' speed limit sign becomes visible on the right as the street subtly curves leftward.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a street scene with a paved road extending into the distance. To the immediate right, a silver SUV is partially visible, its rear quarter facing the viewer. Along the left side of the road, buildings with white stucco and blue awnings line the street, fronted by a row of tall palm trees. On the right side of the road, a sidewalk with green foliage is visible, behind which stands a white building and a street light pole with a 'Speed Limit 30' sign attached.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the silver SUV on the immediate right departs, revealing more of the white building behind it, while the 'Speed Limit 30' sign and its pole also pass out of view to the right. A banner on a pole on the left side of the road and a black car parked further down the right side become visible. Further progression fully reveals the "Beach Town Books" sign on the white building to the right, and the initial street light pole exits the frame to the right. Finally, a yellow diamond-shaped 'PED AHEAD' pedestrian crossing sign and associated road markings further down the road on the right become fully visible.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a street extending away from the viewer, lined with numerous tall palm trees and buildings on both sides under a clear sky. Directly ahead on the road, the word "PED" is painted twice. To the immediate right, a yellow pedestrian crossing sign with "AHEAD" is visible next to a white storefront, while various cars are parked along the street and driving further ahead.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the pedestrian crossing sign on the right gradually exits the frame, revealing outdoor seating and people on the sidewalk to its left. Subsequently, a dark gray SUV appears parked closer on the immediate right, while the road markings directly ahead transition from 'PED' to 'XING' as a person walks along the sidewalk to the right.
