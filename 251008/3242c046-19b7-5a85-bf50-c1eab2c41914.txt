In the first frame, the viewer looks down a narrow street at night, flanked by multi-story buildings. To the left, a building facade with a visible column, glass storefront, and a black A-frame sign occupy the foreground. To the right, a person in a dark coat and light pants walks away from the viewer along the sidewalk. The street recedes into the distance, lined with more buildings featuring illuminated signs and lights, leading to a prominent, cylindrical building visible in the background under a dark sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street, revealing more of the storefronts and building details on both sides that were previously in the midground or background. The person on the right continues walking away from the first-frame viewpoint, moving further down the street as the viewer approaches the areas they previously occupied. Street markings and small potted plants along the right wall become clearer as they draw closer, illustrating the consistent forward movement from the original vantage point.

The viewer is on a paved, narrow street at night, looking down its length. To the immediate left is a white pole and a light-colored building with large windows. The street ahead features white road markings, including an arrow pointing away and a bicycle symbol. On the right, another building with a blue awning and a closed roller shutter parallels the street. Further down the street, a person in a dark coat walks away from the viewer, past a white car parked on the right. Buildings with illuminated signs line both sides, converging towards a distant, prominent white cylindrical building against the dark night sky.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The white pole on the left recedes and moves out of view, revealing a large blue and white advertising sign that was initially behind it, now positioned closer to the viewer on the left. The person walking ahead moves progressively further into the distance, maintaining their position relative to the center of the street. The white car on the right also recedes further down the street as the viewer advances.

The first frame depicts a narrow, illuminated street at night, curving into the distance towards a tall, glowing cylindrical building. On the viewer's left, a building with a red tiled roof and brick facade displays a roller shutter and a glowing square sign. To the right, a person walks away from the viewer past an open garage housing two cars, with another building and an air conditioning unit further right.
end of description
As the viewer progresses forward, the person moves further down the street from the initial viewpoint, while the buildings on both sides appear closer and wider relative to the first-frame viewpoint. This movement reveals a green mat and a blue utility box on the left, previously tiny or hidden from the original perspective, and allows a clearer view of the cars inside the garage ahead of the initial position.
