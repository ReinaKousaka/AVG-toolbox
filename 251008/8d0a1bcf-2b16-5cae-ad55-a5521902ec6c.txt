frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a group of people, many wearing backpacks, walking away from the viewer along a train platform under a brightly lit white roof structure. To their right, a stationary blue "PERURAIL" train, marked with a yellow stripe and illuminated windows, runs parallel to the platform, extending into the background. In the far left background, several grey containers are visible on the platform.
end of description
As the frames progress, the group of people continues walking forward, moving further away from the viewer along the platform towards the front of the train. Their forward movement gradually reveals more of the platform surface that was previously obscured behind them. The blue train on the right remains stationary throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
In the first frame, a group of approximately a dozen people, mostly wearing backpacks, walk away from the viewer on a concrete train platform towards the midground. To the right, a blue train with a yellow stripe and "PERURAIL" written on its side is parked, parallel to the platform, with illuminated windows. Overhead and to the left, white metal support structures for the station roof are visible, extending into the background.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the group of people progressively walks further away from the first-frame viewpoint along the platform, receding into the midground towards the front of the blue train located to the right. The individuals in the foreground of the initial frame gradually move further into the background, maintaining their relative positions within the group. The train and the station's structural elements remain stationary in their original spatial positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a group of people with various backpacks walks away from the viewer on a grey platform, occupying the center to left mid-ground. To their right, a blue train with a prominent yellow stripe along its side is stationary next to the platform, with its interior lights visible through the windows. On the far left foreground, part of a wooden bench and a black and yellow striped pole are visible. Above, a white-painted structural roof covers the platform, extending into the dark background where faint lights can be seen.
end of description
As the frames progress, the blue train on the right side begins to move slowly forward, revealing more of its carriages and the tracks beneath as it passes the viewer's stationary position. Simultaneously, the group of people in the mid-ground continues walking along the platform, maintaining their course relative to the viewer while the train steadily moves further down the tracks and out of the frame's immediate right.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a group of people, mostly carrying backpacks, walk away from the viewer on a train platform. To the viewer's left, a wooden bench with ornate metalwork occupies the foreground, while a white-beamed station roof structure extends overhead and recedes into the background. To the right, a blue train with a distinctive horizontal yellow stripe is parked alongside the platform, its windows reflecting interior lights. Yellow warning stripes mark the edge of the platform floor beneath the passengers and beside the train.
end of description
Next, the group of people continues walking further away from the initial viewpoint along the platform. As the sequence progresses, more of the blue train's length, previously unseen and located further ahead of the first-frame viewpoint, is gradually revealed. Subsequently, an entrance to the train, positioned further along the train from the initial perspective, becomes visible and opens. The passengers in the group then begin to converge towards this newly revealed entrance, preparing to board the train further ahead of where the first frame was captured.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a group of travelers with large backpacks is observed from behind, walking away from the viewer along a train station platform. To their right, a blue train with a yellow stripe is parked, and on their left, wooden benches and a white canopy structure are visible overhead.
end of description
Chronologically, the travelers and their luggage move forward along the platform, progressively receding into the distance relative to the first-frame viewpoint, heading towards the train's entrance further down the platform. The train itself and the station's architecture remain stationary throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a dimly lit train station platform where several travelers with backpacks and rolling luggage stand in the foreground-center, facing away from the viewer, next to a blue train with a yellow stripe and "1971" on its side, stopped on the right; the platform also shows a yellow-striped pillar, a wooden bench on the left, and an overhead roof structure with a "SALIDA 2 / PLATFORM 2" sign in the midground.
end of description
As the frames progress, the travelers move forward along the platform (towards the right, from the first-frame viewpoint) and begin to board the stationary train, disappearing inside the train car. Their luggage also moves onto the train during this process, remaining within the train's interior from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, the viewer looks down a train platform from a slightly elevated perspective, behind a group of several people in the immediate foreground, all facing away and carrying various backpacks and rolling luggage. To the right of these people, a blue train with a prominent yellow stripe along its side is stationary on the tracks, with an open door revealing a lit interior and the number "197..." visible on its side. The train platform extends into the midground and background on the right, featuring yellow and black striped safety markings along its edge. Above the platform, a station canopy with white structural beams stretches from the midground towards the background on the left, and a hanging sign in the midground reads "ANDEN N° 1 PLATFORM N°1". Further down the platform in the background, more people and parts of the station architecture are dimly visible.

end of description

The blue train on the right begins to move forward, gradually revealing more of its cars to the left relative to the viewer's initial position and making more of the platform in the background visible. As the blue train continues its departure to the left, a transparent overlay effect begins, introducing a different train, a yellow and black striped locomotive, emerging from the right side of the frame. This yellow and black train, positioned in the midground, moves towards the left, increasingly obscuring the original blue train's departing cars and the platform scene beneath it. Eventually, the blue train completely exits the scene to the left, while the overlay fully resolves, showing the yellow and black striped train prominently in the foreground and midground, now facing towards the viewer's left.
