The first frame displays a bustling urban street at night, with a sidewalk on the right extending into the midground, lined with brightly lit shops featuring colorful signs. On the left, a road carries a white car and a red double-decker bus moving away from the viewer, alongside another sidewalk busy with pedestrians and tall buildings. In the immediate foreground, a person with blonde hair is visible to the left, and the back of a person in a black jacket occupies the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward: the blonde-haired person in the left foreground quickly exits the frame to the left, while the person in the right foreground moves further into the scene, revealing more of the shops and pedestrians previously ahead. The white car and red bus on the road continue to recede further from the initial viewpoint, as new pedestrians appear into the midground from behind where the initial foreground figures were positioned.

The first frame displays a bustling city street at night from a pedestrian's viewpoint on a sidewalk, with multiple people walking away from the viewer on the right, and a lone woman approaching in the mid-ground. To the left, a multi-lane road features a red double-decker bus and a gathering crowd on the far sidewalk, while both sides are lined with tall buildings, brightly lit storefronts, and illuminated advertising billboards.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the pedestrians on the right sidewalk continue moving away from the viewer, while the woman in the light coat steadily walks closer. Simultaneously, the red double-decker bus on the left side of the road slowly progresses further away, causing the crowd to subtly shift. Concurrently, the large illuminated billboards on the right, above the shops, dynamically change their displayed advertisements.

In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a busy city sidewalk at night, looking down a street lined with brightly lit shops and large billboards on the right, with tall buildings against a dark sky in the background. Several pedestrians walk away on the right sidewalk in the foreground and mid-ground, while a multi-lane road with a red double-decker bus and other vehicles occupies the left side of the mid-ground.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the viewer's perspective remains relatively static. Pedestrians on the right sidewalk continue their movement away from the viewer. A woman in a tan coat, initially further back on the right, walks forward smiling and carrying shopping bags, passing close to and to the immediate right of the viewer. The distant street traffic and crowds on the left also show subtle motion, but primarily the pedestrian flow on the right is dynamic.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a blurred woman in a light brown coat occupies the immediate foreground, walking towards the right on a busy city sidewalk. To her left, a street extends into the distance, featuring two marked lanes and a yellow curb line, bordered on the far side by a black metal barrier. Behind this barrier, on a left-side sidewalk, numerous people are visible in front of a modern building with visible windows and some purple lighting. Further along the right-side sidewalk, behind the foreground woman, many pedestrians walk past brightly lit storefronts, including one labeled "3DG Jewellery," below large illuminated signs overhead. In the midground, a red double-decker bus is stopped in traffic, and a large billboard displaying a red watch is visible on the left side, with tall buildings rising in the background.
end of description
The woman in the immediate foreground moves steadily to the right across subsequent frames, gradually revealing more of the busy right-side sidewalk and its storefronts until she exits the frame entirely. Simultaneously, other pedestrians on the right-side sidewalk progress forward, moving past the space previously occupied by the foreground woman. The red double-decker bus and other background elements further down the street remain largely static throughout the sequence, maintaining their spatial positions relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a bustling night-time city street from a pedestrian's viewpoint, with a paved sidewalk on the right populated by people walking past brightly lit shops extending into the midground, and a two-lane road on the left featuring a stopped red double-decker bus and a crowd on the opposite sidewalk, all flanked by tall buildings adorned with luminous signs and a large watch advertisement in the mid-left.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the right sidewalk, causing the initial foreground figures to recede out of view towards the bottom and revealing more of the street and shops further ahead relative to the first-frame position. Concurrently, pedestrians on both sides dynamically shift, with new individuals continuously entering the midground from positions previously out of frame behind the viewer's initial foreground.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a night-time city street scene. To the viewer's right, a busy sidewalk extends into the distance, populated by pedestrians walking both towards and away from the viewer, alongside brightly lit storefronts and commercial signs overhead. To the viewer's left, a multi-lane road stretches forward, marked with white arrows, bordered by a metal fence behind which a crowd of people and a red double-decker bus are visible, adjacent to a large billboard advertising a watch. In the background, tall buildings with illuminated windows rise under a dark sky.

end of description

As the frames progress, pedestrians on the right-hand sidewalk continuously move; a man in a grey jacket walks towards the viewer from the mid-foreground, while an individual wearing a green mask emerges and approaches from the mid-ground. Simultaneously, the large double-decker bus on the left side of the street slowly advances forward, and other people and vehicles in the background subtly shift their positions, maintaining the street's dynamic flow.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a bustling city street at night, viewed from a slightly elevated position. On the left, a multi-lane road with white directional arrows leads towards a crosswalk teeming with pedestrians, a red double-decker bus, and large illuminated billboards featuring a smartwatch, all beneath tall buildings. On the right, a brightly lit sidewalk is occupied by a stream of pedestrians walking towards the viewer, bordered by storefronts with glowing signs; in the foreground, a man in a black jacket stands on the left edge of the sidewalk, a man in a light jacket walks towards the viewer in the center-right, and a woman wearing a green mask walks on the far right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the woman in the green mask walks past the viewer and moves out of frame to the right, while the man in the light jacket also advances closer to the viewer. A man in a black cap and jacket, with long hair, emerges from behind the man in the light jacket, moving towards the viewer, and a woman in a red cloak and backpack appears from behind the stationary man on the left sidewalk, also walking forward. The stream of pedestrians on the right sidewalk continuously moves closer to the viewer, revealing new faces, while the activity on the street to the left remains generally consistent.
