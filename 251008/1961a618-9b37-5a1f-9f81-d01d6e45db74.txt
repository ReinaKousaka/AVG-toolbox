To his left, a bus stop shelter with an advertisement, followed by a closed street-level entrance and a street pole with signs, extends into the mid-ground. On the right, a building wall with large windows parallels the sidewalk, leading towards other pedestrians and distant buildings down the street, all under a clear sky.

Subsequently, the scooter moves further down the street to the left and out of view, as new cars emerge and pass. The initial pedestrian continues walking forward, and a cyclist along with additional pedestrians become visible further ahead on the sidewalk.
