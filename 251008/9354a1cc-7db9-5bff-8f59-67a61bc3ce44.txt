The first frame captures a sunny city street scene featuring a crosswalk with green and white stripes in the immediate foreground, with a wide street and buildings receding into the background. To the viewer's left, a tan building borders a sidewalk where a person walks past a green subway entrance marked "14 Street Station ACE" and a "Raise Plow" sign. In the midground, multiple pedestrians are visible on the central sidewalk and another person, pulling a red suitcase, crosses the street from the right.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the person on the far left continues walking further towards the left edge of the frame, while the central pedestrian in the brown coat steadily moves closer to the viewer. Simultaneously, the individual with the red suitcase progresses further from the viewer's right towards the left, crossing the street.

In the first frame, a gray trash can stands left of center on the sidewalk, with a red "RAISE PLOW" sign affixed to a pole to its far left. A person in a green jacket walks towards the left, while a person in a brown coat walks towards the viewer on the sidewalk. Behind them, a green subway station entrance for "14 Street Station A C E L" is visible. To the right, a person in red pants pulls a red suitcase across the street, near street signs for "ONE WAY" and "11th St." City buildings line both sides of the street under a clear blue sky.

The person in the green jacket moves further left on the sidewalk, appearing behind the subway entrance from the viewer's perspective. Other pedestrians on the sidewalk also shift positions, and a blue bus becomes visible in the far right background, moving left across the street.
