In the first frame, a paved road with "ZONE 30" marked on it stretches into the midground, flanked by autumn leaves. To the left, a multi-story apartment building with balconies stands, while a white house with green shutters and an attached light brown extension occupies the right, featuring an external staircase. A tree branch with autumn leaves hangs in the upper left, and a mountain range rises in the distant background under a clear sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the 'ZONE 30' marking recedes, and the tree branch in the upper left moves out of the frame. The white house on the right and the apartment building on the left both become larger, revealing more of their facades and the ground directly in front of them. Specifically, the lighter brown extension on the right reveals more of its lower structure and a door previously obscured.

The first frame presents a street scene with a large beige apartment building featuring multiple balconies and construction fencing on the left. On the right, a white building with green shutters and a partial balcony is visible, with a black car parked adjacent to it. An asphalt road leads into the distance, flanked by more buildings and distant, tree-covered mountains under a clear sky. end of description.
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The construction fencing on the left recedes, revealing more of the building's base and a red fire hydrant. Simultaneously, the right-side building becomes more visible, revealing a shopfront and a full street light pole, while the black car appears slightly closer.

First, a street stretches ahead towards a distant mountain range, flanked by buildings on both sides. Immediately to the left of the viewer, a large beige building with multiple balconies stands, bordered by a construction fence. On the right, a black car is parked in front of a white building with green shutters. Further down the street, various houses line the path, including a smaller wooden building visible on the right, all beneath a clear blue sky. end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint steadily moves forward along the street. The black car on the right moves away from the viewer, eventually exiting the frame to the right, revealing a dark red car parked behind it, still to the right of the street. Concurrently, the construction fence on the left recedes as the viewer advances past its initial position. A white trailer with a green tarp, previously partially obscured by the fence, becomes fully visible to the left of the street. Yellow markings on the street surface ahead also become more pronounced as the perspective shifts forward.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a paved road extending directly forward, flanked immediately on the left by a multi-story building and an adjacent construction area with fencing and a trailer. To the right, a house with a wooden upper facade and external stairs stands, while further ahead along the curving road, additional buildings are visible against distant, autumn-colored mountains under a clear sky.
end of description
As the camera advances, both the left-side building, with its construction area, and the right-side house move closer to the viewer and progressively out of frame towards their respective lateral edges. Simultaneously, the road ahead continuously unfurls, bringing previously distant buildings and a blue parking sign, initially positioned far ahead and to the left of the road, into closer and sharper focus.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a paved road stretches forward from the viewer, curving slightly to the right. To the viewer's immediate left, part of a light-colored building with multiple balconies and green shutters rises, with a blue parking sign attached to its lower section and metal barriers in front of it. To the viewer's immediate right, another light-colored building with a wooden upper story and an external wooden staircase occupies the foreground, with cobbled ground beneath it. Further down the road, a larger light-colored building with a dark roof and green shutters is centrally visible, with other smaller buildings scattered beyond it, all set against a large mountain range with autumn-colored trees in the far background.
end of description
The viewpoint moves steadily forward along the road. The building on the viewer's left gradually recedes and moves out of frame, revealing more of the parking area and metal barriers to its left. Simultaneously, the building on the right also recedes, its lower section shifting further right and exposing a new lighter-colored building with large windows to its right. As the path straightens slightly, the central distant buildings appear progressively closer and larger, while a street light pole emerges to their left. The mountain in the far background remains generally centered but reveals slightly more of its peak to the upper right as the viewer advances.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a street winding slightly to the right, with a paved area and a white construction fence on the immediate left. Behind the fence and further down the left side stands a multi-story white building with green-shuttered windows and a dark roof, accompanied by a lamppost. On the right, a light-colored building with a large storefront window and smaller upper windows adorned with orange-striped curtains is prominent, with a darker building section partially visible at the far right edge. In the background, a large, tree-covered mountain range featuring a distinct peak rises steeply under a clear, light blue sky.
end of description
The viewpoint progressively moves forward and slightly to the right. The dark building section on the immediate far right of the first frame gradually moves out of view to the right, revealing more of the street and a dark car parked further ahead on the right sidewalk. Simultaneously, the construction fence on the immediate left recedes and eventually moves out of view to the far left, revealing the full facade and balcony of the white building to its left. The lamppost also shifts from the left mid-ground towards the left foreground, indicating forward movement. As the perspective advances, more of the street ahead and additional buildings further down the road become visible.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a paved street leading into a town, flanked by buildings and backed by mountains. To the left, a multi-story white building with green shutters and a balcony occupies the foreground. To the right, another white building is partially visible, with a dark station wagon parked prominently in front of it. Further ahead, more houses line the street as it curves, with a large mountain displaying autumnal foliage and a distinct peak in the background under a clear sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the dark station wagon on the right recedes from its initial position and eventually moves out of frame to the right of the first-frame viewpoint. This action reveals a wooden building and a red fire hydrant previously obscured behind it, now visible to the right of the first-frame's path. Meanwhile, the buildings on both sides recede, bringing a small blue car, initially seen further ahead on the left, more prominently into view.
