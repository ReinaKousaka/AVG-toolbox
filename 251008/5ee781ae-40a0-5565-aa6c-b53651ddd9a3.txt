In the first frame, a wet asphalt street with white and blue lane markings stretches into the distance, bordered on the left by a row of black bollards connected by yellow ropes, behind which buildings with storefronts and trees line the road. To the far left, a 'Dominos Pizza' sign is visible. On the right, a black metal fence curves along a wet sidewalk, with a light grey utility pole positioned centrally on the right side, and a red delivery scooter with a 'Dominos Pizza' box parked behind the fence, partially obscured by the pole and fence.

As the frames progress, the camera slowly moves forward and slightly to the right of the initial viewpoint, maintaining the rainy street scene. The red Domino's Pizza scooter and the utility pole progressively shift left across the frame, revealing more of the sidewalk and storefronts to their right. A second red delivery scooter, identified as Pizza Hut, becomes increasingly visible to the right of the first scooter and further along the sidewalk from the original viewpoint. A tree trunk that was previously obscured by the utility pole emerges more clearly to the right of the pole. Further down the street, on the right sidewalk, a person holding a white umbrella slowly walks away from the original viewpoint, and more distant storefronts and advertising signs become visible.

The first frame shows a rainy street with a dark pole and a red scooter in the immediate left foreground, adjacent to a black metal railing. Beyond the railing lies a wet asphalt road with distant buildings and an overpass, while to the right, a tiled sidewalk features trees, storefronts, and a person with an umbrella walking away.

Subsequently, a 'Rain Everyday' logo appears in the bottom-left corner, and a silver sedan is newly revealed entering the scene from the far background on the road. This car then drives towards and past the viewer on the left side of the frame, continuing down the street away from the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the person with the umbrella steadily moves further into the distance on the right sidewalk.
