The first frame displays a vibrant city street at night, featuring a multi-story building with illuminated storefronts on the left and a row of trees adorned with red string lights and street lamps lining the right side. Numerous pedestrians, including a figure in a dark fur-hooded coat in the lower-middle foreground, walk away from the viewer along the brightly lit pavement towards the background where a street vendor's stall is visible. The dark blue sky overhead suggests dusk or early night.

In subsequent frames, all visible pedestrians, especially the central fur-hooded figure, continue to move forward, progressively receding further away from the viewer down the street. No new objects or scenes are revealed, as the camera's viewpoint remains static, capturing the ongoing movement of the crowd within the initial setting.

The first frame captures a vibrant pedestrian street scene at dusk. In the immediate foreground on the left, the back of a person with long hair tied back, wearing a plaid coat, is prominent. Directly ahead and extending into the midground, a diverse crowd of people occupies the brightly lit paved walkway, with some walking towards and many away from the viewer. A person in a distinctive black parka with a fur-lined hood walks away from the viewer in the midground right. To the far right, a display stand resembling a newspaper or souvenir kiosk is visible, positioned near the base of a large tree trunk that anchors the right side of the frame, alongside a decorative street lamp. On the left side of the street, tall buildings with multiple stories and illuminated windows line the path. In the background, a long row of trees, heavily decorated with festive red string lights, stretches down the boulevard under a dark blue sky.

Following frames show the crowd continuing their movement along the path, with the person in the fur-lined hood proceeding further away from the viewer on the mid-right. A new person in a bright orange jacket enters the frame from the far left, moving towards the viewer. Simultaneously, a small child in a black vest runs from the mid-right, passing closer to the viewer before moving deeper into the scene on the right. The composition of pedestrians constantly shifts as individuals walk in various directions across the foreground and midground.
