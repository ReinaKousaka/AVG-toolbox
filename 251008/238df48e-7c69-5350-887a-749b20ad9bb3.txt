The first frame shows a densely packed city street at night, with numerous pedestrians walking towards and away from the viewer; a light blue bus/tram and police officers are visible on the left in the midground, while storefronts with pink and grey roll-down shutters and Japanese signs line the right side of the street. end of description
In subsequent frames, the crowd dynamically shifts, with individuals in the immediate foreground moving slightly left and out of view, revealing new people and details previously behind them. A man in a dark blue sweater, holding a drink bottle, emerges more clearly in the mid-right as other pedestrians move around him. The constant flow of people means the composition of individuals continuously changes relative to the initial viewpoint.

A dense crowd of people, many wearing masks, fills an urban street at night, extending from the immediate foreground towards the distant background. On the far left, a police bus with flashing lights and several officers are visible behind the crowd, with buildings and illuminated signs further back. To the right, a row of buildings with closed storefronts lines the street.

The camera subtly shifts, revealing more of the ground and the lower bodies of the moving pedestrians. The crowd continues to flow, with individuals like the masked man in the foreground on the right and a woman entering from the far left moving further into or across the scene, all remaining within the street relative to the initial viewpoint.
