In the first frame, a wet paved path with a white line curves from the foreground right, bordered on its left by a light metal fence and green bushes. Beyond them, a dark wooden boardwalk with two pergolas extends over water on the left, leading towards a multi-arched concrete bridge spanning the background. Dense green trees line the far bank to the left under an overcast sky.

Rain visibly falls across all frames, causing ripples on the water and wetting the path. From the sixth frame onwards, a yellow-green umbrella or cover appears in the immediate top-left foreground, dripping water onto the scene below.
