The first frame displays a street scene under an overcast sky, with a grand brick hotel building on the left background and a tall building with a distinctive tower on the far right background. In the midground, a curving stone wall separates a paved area from a grassy incline with a concrete staircase, flanked by an evergreen tree and tall palm trees. A black information kiosk is partially visible in the bottom-left foreground, and a lamppost stands near the staircase on the right.

The subsequent frames show the view panning left relative to the first-frame viewpoint. This progressively reveals more of the harbor to the left, including several docked white sailboats with tall masts and additional urban buildings in the far left background. As the pan continues, the palm trees and the distant tower on the right gradually move out of sight, while the large brick hotel on the left remains prominently centered. Newly visible black bollards line the water's edge in the mid-left, and a couple of individuals appear near the water, slightly left of the initial central view.

The first frame displays a harbor scene under an overcast sky. In the foreground, a dark paved area stretches across the bottom, with several dark bollards connected by chains defining the edge of a body of water. To the left in the midground, numerous sailboats and other boats are docked on the water, reflecting the sky; to the right, a stone embankment with steps leads up to a landscaped area, beyond which a large, ornate brick building with a dark roof dominates the background. A person in a red jacket stands by the water's edge on the right.

A person in a red jacket is seen walking left along the water's edge from the midground right. Subsequently, foliage from a tree is newly revealed, entering the frame from the far right, and further movement reveals more of the tree on the right. Later, a bird appears flying in the sky from the far left, traversing across the upper portion of the frame towards the right.

The first frame depicts an overcast, grey sky spanning the top third of the scene. In the background, a grand, ornate brick hotel with dark peaked roofs stands prominently in the center-right, while other city buildings line the horizon further to the left. A calm body of water occupies the left mid-ground, reflecting the distant structures, bordered by a paved walkway lined with dark bollards and chains. To the far right, a tall stone wall rises, topped by a dark evergreen tree, and a person in red is visible walking along the distant waterfront path. A white bird flies in the upper-left sky.
end of description
The white bird, initially in the upper-left sky, dynamically moves rightward across the frame, eventually flying out of view behind the large background building. Simultaneously, the person in red on the far-left walkway continues walking further away from the viewer along the waterfront. The viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly downward, causing the foreground bollards to appear marginally larger and closer, revealing a fraction more of the paved ground directly in front of the viewer.
