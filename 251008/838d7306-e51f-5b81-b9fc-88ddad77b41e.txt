The first frame depicts a wide street intersection with a zebra crosswalk prominent in the foreground, where several pedestrians are actively crossing from the left and right. Buildings line both sides of the street, extending into the midground and background under a clear blue sky, with vehicles like a white van visible further down the road to the right.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the pedestrians in the foreground continue moving across the crosswalk from left to right, with additional people joining the crossing from the left sidewalk. Simultaneously, a red object becomes more distinct further down the street to the left of the white van, and a red bus then emerges from the far left, progressively moving behind the group of crossing pedestrians.

The first frame captures a sunny city street scene from a low-angle perspective, centered on a pedestrian crosswalk. In the immediate foreground, a man and a girl are walking from the right side towards the left, away from the viewer, while a woman and a girl walk from the left-center towards the right, appearing to move towards the viewer. To the far left, several pedestrians are on the sidewalk alongside multi-story brick buildings with various storefronts. A white van is positioned mid-ground on the right side of the street, which extends into the distance, revealing other vehicles. The background features more city buildings under a clear blue sky.

In subsequent frames, the man and girl initially on the right move further left and away from the viewer, eventually exiting the frame. Concurrently, the woman and girl in the center move further right and slightly closer to the viewer. The white van on the right side of the street also moves forward, receding further into the distance away from the viewer. A new man and woman emerge from the far left, traversing the crosswalk towards the viewer. Additionally, a distinctive red umbrella-like object becomes visible in the mid-ground, positioned on the left side of the street between the buildings.
