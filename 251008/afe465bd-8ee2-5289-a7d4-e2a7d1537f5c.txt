The first frame depicts a rainy night street scene with wet, reflective pavement. To the left, a white sedan, a black sedan, and a white SUV are parked. On the right, a bright blue vertical sign precedes buildings with multiple illuminated Korean signs stretching into the background. A person with a black umbrella walks away from the viewer in the midground, with other distant figures visible further down the street under a dark sky.

Subsequently, the person with the black umbrella continues walking away from the viewer, moving further down the street towards the right. Other distant pedestrians also proceed along the same path, but no new objects or scenes are revealed from behind existing structures or off-screen.

The first frame displays a rain-slicked city street at night, looking down a thoroughfare lined with multi-story buildings adorned with numerous illuminated signs in Korean. On the left side, a white SUV is parked facing away from the viewer, partially obscuring a yellow car in front of it. The wet pavement in the foreground and mid-ground reflects the ambient lights. On the right, a tall, vibrant blue vertical sign stands prominently, and further down the street, a person holding a black umbrella walks towards the viewer. A white sedan is parked facing the viewer further down the right side, and more buildings with glowing signs extend into the dark background.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the person holding the black umbrella, initially in the middle-right, consistently moves closer to the viewer. The reflective surfaces of the wet pavement subtly shimmer and change with the ongoing rain. No new objects or scenes are revealed, nor do other static elements significantly change their spatial positions.
