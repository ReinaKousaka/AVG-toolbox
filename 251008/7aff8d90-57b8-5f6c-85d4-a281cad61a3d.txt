The first frame displays a street with yellow zebra crossings in the immediate foreground, leading towards a large, central beige building and a brown, half-timbered building to its left. A street lamp is positioned above the buildings, with smaller trees and a pedestrian sign along the sidewalk, while an intersection with a '30' speed limit sign lies to the right, and distant hills and buildings complete the background under a blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward and slightly to the left relative to the initial position. Consequently, the foreground zebra crossing becomes more central, and the beige building appears to subtly rotate, revealing more of its right facade, which was previously less visible. A new church spire emerges in the mid-left background, further down the street beyond the brown building, while the '30' speed limit sign, initially on the far right, eventually moves out of view.
