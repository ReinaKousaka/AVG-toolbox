The first frame shows a bright city street from the perspective of a pedestrian on a wide, striped sidewalk. To the left, a multi-lane road with several cars is visible, separated by a green hedge and a bare tree. Further down the sidewalk on the left is a modern bus stop shelter with a green sign, beyond which tall buildings line the street. To the right, the sidewalk continues, bordered by a building with reflective dark glass and several green trees. Four pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk ahead, walking towards the viewer: one person in a black jacket near the bus stop, and three others (white/gray jacket, purple top, brown jacket) closer to the viewer.
end of description
As the camera slowly moves forward, the four pedestrians on the sidewalk progressively approach and then pass the initial viewpoint. The individual in the black jacket, initially near the bus stop, moves closer to the viewer's original position, followed by the other three who also continue walking past the first-frame viewpoint. The camera eventually moves past the bus stop shelter, which remains to the left of the original viewpoint, revealing more of the street further ahead.
