The first frame displays a wet city street on a rainy day, featuring white zebra crossing stripes and two white directional arrows painted on the asphalt in the foreground. Parked cars and a white sedan are visible along the left side of the road, while an orange traffic cone stands in the mid-road. On the right, a sidewalk borders a commercial building with an awning, trees, and a dark grey SUV parked in the far right foreground, all receding into the background under an overcast sky.

In subsequent frames, the white sedan on the left drives towards the viewer, eventually exiting the frame to the viewer's immediate left. Simultaneously, the orange traffic cone, initially standing in the mid-road, is knocked over by an unseen vehicle and subsequently dragged to the viewer's left, remaining on its side. The dark grey SUV parked on the far right also gradually moves forward, disappearing mostly out of the frame to the viewer's right.

The first frame depicts a wet city street on an overcast day, looking forward, with parked cars on the left and a sidewalk featuring trees and storefronts on the right. Several orange traffic barriers stand centrally on the wet asphalt road, which is marked with a prominent white arrow pointing away and yellow dashed lines. end of description. In subsequent frames, these orange traffic barriers progressively move further away from the viewer down the wet street, eventually revealing more of the white road markings. The stack of black tires on the right also recedes into the distance alongside the barriers.

The first frame depicts a wet city street under an overcast sky, looking forward along a road flanked by buildings and trees. Two orange plastic road barriers are visible in the mid-ground, slightly right of center, with parked cars lining the left and buildings extending into the hazy distance.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the closest orange barrier progresses from the mid-ground, shifting right and eventually out of the frame at the bottom-right. The second orange barrier then becomes more central, and a third orange barrier emerges into view from the right side, positioned ahead and to the right of the now central second barrier.
