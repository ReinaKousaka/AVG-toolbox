In the first frame, a wet, asphalt road curves gently to the right, with scattered autumn leaves on its right edge. To the viewer's immediate left, a narrower paved path is bordered by green and brown foliage, while a streetlamp stands further along. A tall, dark, vine-covered stone wall rises steeply on the right, with a parked white vehicle and a grey container visible next to it further down the road. Behind the wall and on the left side, a steep, green hillside and distant mountains with trees are visible under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the road continues to curve right, revealing a large body of water (likely a lake) and distant mountains on the left side, behind the trees. The initial white vehicle and grey container on the right are passed, and a grey van becomes visible parked behind them along the wall. The steep green hillside with a concrete structure (possibly an elevated road) on top of it becomes more prominent on the viewer's right. The elements on the right (wall, container, van) move from the midground to the foreground and then exit the frame to the right.
