The first frame shows a man in a blue jacket in the immediate foreground to the left, looking right. To the right, a light-colored wooden shelving unit with various items is partially visible. In the midground, a dense crowd of people occupies the center, moving amidst market stalls with white canopies on the left and a produce stand with a white truck behind it on the right. Tall city buildings rise in the background under a bright sky.

The viewer's perspective shifts forward and slightly right. The man in the blue jacket moves out of view to the left, and the shelving unit on the right also exits the frame, revealing more of the bustling market scene. A person with a large grey backpack becomes prominent in the mid-left, and a person sits on a large rock in the center. The crowd continues to move, and more market stalls become visible further into the scene.
