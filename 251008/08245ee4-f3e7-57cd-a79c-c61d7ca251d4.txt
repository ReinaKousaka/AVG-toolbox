frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame shows train tracks extending from the viewer into the distance, curving gently to the right, bordered by snow-covered ground. A tall utility pole with overhead wires stands immediately to the viewer's left, while sparse bare trees and rocky terrain flank both sides, rising towards distant hills under a clear blue sky.

As the viewpoint moves forward, the initial utility pole recedes behind the viewer to the left. New segments of snow-covered landscape and bare trees are continuously revealed ahead along both sides of the tracks, with additional utility poles appearing further in the distance as the train progresses around the curve.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows two train tracks extending directly in front of the viewer, curving right into a snow-covered, tree-lined landscape under a clear blue sky. Overhead electrical lines and a prominent pole are visible to the left, slightly ahead of the immediate forward view along the tracks, with smaller poles further in the distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the tracks, the surrounding snowy terrain, trees, and electrical poles continuously shift their positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint, moving closer, passing the viewer, and then receding. Notably, a previously distant electrical pole on the left comes into full view, passing the viewer and revealing a series of stacked, green cylindrical weights attached to its left side, which were not visible in the initial frames.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a winter landscape under a clear blue sky, looking down a set of train tracks that curve to the right in the mid-distance. To the immediate left of the viewer, an embankment covered in snow, sparse bare trees, and patches of brown earth leads up to a snow-dusted hill. A tall utility pole with overhead power lines stands near the left tracks in the mid-ground, with another visible further ahead on the same side. To the right, a snow-covered embankment with sparse trees parallels the tracks, while a small red building is visible against distant snow-covered hills.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the tracks. The nearest utility pole on the left approaches and then passes the viewer, receding to the left and behind the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the second utility pole, initially further ahead on the left, moves closer, revealing more of the snow-covered landscape and trees to the sides of the tracks. The tracks themselves continually extend from the viewer's front, curving to the right, as the distant red building and mountains on the horizon gradually draw nearer.
