The first frame depicts a narrow, wet alleyway at night, lined with buildings on both sides. To the left, a building with an orange awning has several red lanterns hanging below it, and two vending machines (one blue, one light-colored) are visible at ground level next to some potted plants. The alley recedes into the distance, illuminated by various neon signs and numerous paper lanterns (red, white, and patterned) strung overhead, while a utility pole with bicycles parked nearby is on the far right. Three individuals are visible further down the alley: two walking away from the viewer in the center, and one walking towards the viewer on the right side of the street.
end of description
The individuals in the alleyway are in motion. The person walking towards the viewer from the far right side of the street steadily approaches, moving closer to the first-frame viewpoint. Meanwhile, the two individuals initially walking away in the middle of the street continue to recede into the distance, shifting slightly towards the right side of the path.

The first frame depicts a wet, nighttime alley lined with buildings, featuring two illuminated vending machines on the far left and various glowing lanterns overhead and along the path. Two individuals are positioned mid-left, moving inward, while a woman walks away from the viewer down the alley on the right, past parked bicycles and a building with a white sign.
end of description
Following frames show the two individuals on the mid-left continuing to move deeper into the building entrance to their left, gradually becoming less visible. Concurrently, the woman on the right continues walking further down the alley, away from the viewer, appearing smaller as she recedes into the background.

The first frame captures a narrow, wet alleyway at night, illuminated by numerous signs and lanterns on multi-story buildings receding into the distance. On the left, a person in a white shirt is partially visible moving away, while on the right, another individual with light hair drags a skateboard, also moving away from the viewer, near a parked white bicycle.
end of description
As the frames progress, both individuals continue their movement away from the viewer, eventually exiting the scene to the left and right respectively. Following their departure, a stack of reddish-brown crates and a white cylindrical bin are revealed on the lower left side, adjacent to the alley. Simultaneously, a cluster of white umbrellas hanging downwards becomes clearly visible on the lower right building wall. Finally, a white vehicle appears further down the alley in the background.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A narrow, dimly lit street at night, flanked by multi-story buildings adorned with numerous illuminated signs and lanterns, recedes into the distance where a white vehicle is barely visible. On the left, an air conditioning unit and shop fronts are near the viewer, while a yellow bicycle stands further down; on the right, a blackboard sign with prices and hanging umbrellas are prominent.
end of description
The viewer slowly moves forward along the street. Consequently, the red lantern on the right and the yellow bicycle on the left gradually shift closer and become more centered within the frame as the perspective advances, bringing the distant parts of the street into closer view.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a narrow, wet alleyway in a city at night, extending into the distance from the viewer's perspective. Buildings line both sides, adorned with various illuminated signs, many with Japanese text, and several lanterns. On the left, multiple signs are visible on the buildings, including a prominent blue rectangular sign and a yellow "SUNTORY" sign, while a yellow bicycle leans against a wall further back. The right side features a utility pole, a large silver pipe, and several illuminated lanterns, including one red and multiple yellow ones. Overhead, strings of green, checkerboard-patterned lanterns stretch across the alley, receding towards the background where more lights are visible against the dark sky. The wet ground reflects the various lights, suggesting recent rain.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the most significant dynamic change is the appearance and intensification of falling snow or sleet. These small white particles descend from above the viewer, becoming visible across the entire alley from the foreground pavement to the distant background lights. The precipitation continues to fall throughout the subsequent frames, adding a dynamic, atmospheric element to the previously static urban night scene. No new permanent objects or changes to the alley's structure are revealed.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a narrow, wet alleyway at night, lined with buildings featuring numerous signs and illuminated lanterns. A blue sign with Japanese text hangs prominently in the foreground to the left, above a closed roller shutter, with a yellow bicycle parked on the pavement nearby. Overhead, green checkered lanterns are strung across the alley, which recedes into a well-lit distance.
end of description
As the camera slowly moves forward, the foreground blue sign and yellow bicycle on the left, along with the right-side cabinet, progressively recede and shift out of frame. This movement reveals more of the buildings' details and illuminated lanterns further down the alley, drawing the viewer deeper into the scene.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a narrow, wet alleyway at night, looking forward from the viewer's perspective. To the immediate left, a building wall is covered by a bamboo screen with several exposed light bulbs hanging from above, and a bicycle is parked further down the path. To the immediate right, a large yellow lantern hangs prominently from a building facade, with clear plastic sheeting and stacked items below it, and another bicycle parked further along the alley. Ahead, the alley recedes, lined with more buildings, overhead lanterns (some green checkered), and illuminated signs in the distance.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the camera's viewpoint remains largely stationary, looking down the alley. A person gradually becomes visible in the distance, walking towards the viewer along the center of the alley. This individual continues to approach, moving from the far end of the alley towards the foreground, growing slightly more distinct with each frame. Additionally, items on the left side, specifically bottles on a shelf beneath the bamboo screen, become slightly more revealed as the sequence progresses.
