The first frame shows a paved road extending from the bottom center into the distance, curving gently to the left. Double yellow lines separate the lanes on the left side, and a solid white line marks the right shoulder. Dry, yellowish-brown grass and scrubland line both verges of the road. A dark brown wooden post stands in the left verge near the viewer, while another post is further back on the right verge, with a small light-colored rock closer on the right. Towering red-orange sandstone cliffs rise steeply on both sides, forming a canyon, with a vast clear blue sky above.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the road and surrounding canyon walls appear to approach the viewer, and the initial wooden posts on both sides recede. Subsequently, a yellow chevron sign, indicating a sharp left curve, emerges from the far distance on the right side of the road, steadily advancing towards the viewer's current position as the journey continues.
