The first frame depicts a rainy street scene with a wet asphalt road having yellow and white crosswalk markings in the foreground. In the midground, two masked individuals walk towards the viewer on the crosswalk, one with a green umbrella on the left and another with a blue umbrella on the right. To their immediate left, a white car and a red street pole are partially visible, while further right, a white pickup truck, a yellow taxi, a building, and a partial white SUV are present. The background shows residential buildings and trees under a cloudy sky.

The two individuals with umbrellas continue walking past the viewer, eventually moving out of the frame to the left. Concurrently, a new person with a black umbrella emerges from behind the white SUV on the far right and begins walking across the crosswalk towards the left. The yellow taxi cab at the intersection then shifts slightly forward, and a cyclist briefly appears and passes on the far left, behind the red pole.
