The first frame captures a snowy night scene on an urban street, viewed from a low angle on a sidewalk. In the immediate foreground to the left is a dark, thin pole, while the snow-covered sidewalk with visible footprints extends upwards and right from the viewer. Centrally, a tall street lamp illuminates the scene, casting a glow on surrounding snow-dusted trees and shrubs. To the left of the lamp, a wet, snow-lined street curves uphill, flanked by a modern building with balconies. To the right, a large, lighter-colored stone building with illuminated windows and decorative sconces rises alongside the uphill sidewalk.

The camera steadily moves forward along the snow-covered sidewalk, ascending the street relative to the initial viewpoint. As the viewpoint advances, the foreground pole moves out of view below, and the street lamp shifts towards the left side of the frame. More of the stone building's facade on the right and the winding path ahead are revealed as the viewer progresses. Simultaneously, a transparent umbrella appears above the viewer's head, slowly extending across the upper part of the scene before retracting or moving out of frame.

The first frame depicts a snow-dusted, narrow path receding into the distance, marked with footprints. To the viewer's right, a beige building with a grey foundation runs parallel, featuring several dark-paned windows. On the left, a lower structure supports snow-covered green bushes and trees adorned with glowing string lights, while bare trees and a cloudy sky are visible in the background.

The viewpoint steadily moves forward and slightly right, causing the building on the right to extend further into view, revealing more of its lower facade and increasingly detailed window reflections. Simultaneously, the path's snow cover on the left diminishes, replaced by reflective puddles, indicating melting. The foliage on the left appears to recede and reveal darker ground beneath, as if shedding snow. The overall lighting dims slightly, deepening the shadows along the path.
