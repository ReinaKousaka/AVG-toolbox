In the foreground, a man in a light grey trench coat walks rightward across a white crosswalk line, positioned slightly left of the viewer's center. Directly in front, a concrete utility pole with a black traffic light displaying a green signal stands slightly right of the viewer's center. Across the street, a two-story building complex occupies the midground, featuring "MR. CONE DONAIR" on the left and "Robson Gastown" with pink neon on the right. To the left of the utility pole, a grey SUV is present, while several cars are parked further right along the street. Bare-branched trees line both sides of the street, extending into the background where faint buildings rise under a cloudy sky, with green and blue banners and red bunting visible overhead.
end of description
The man in the grey coat continues walking from the left to the right side of the frame, moving further away from the viewer. The grey SUV behind him, slightly to the left of the utility pole, also slowly advances forward. Simultaneously, the pedestrian signal on the utility pole changes from a green walking person to a red hand. On the far right, another silver SUV parked along the street begins to move forward.
