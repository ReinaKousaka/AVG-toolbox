The first frame depicts a narrow, moss-covered cobblestone alley flanked by old buildings, with potted plants lining both sides. On the left, stairs with a metal railing ascend to an upper door, while a small brown door is visible further down the alley in the distance.
end of description
A small black cat emerges from the distant end of the alley and slowly walks towards the viewer along the cobblestone path. Simultaneously, a flat, light gray rectangular panel slides into view from the right side, eventually standing upright in the foreground on the right, partially obscuring the wall. The cat continues its approach, eventually nearing the foreground as the panel settles into its final position.
