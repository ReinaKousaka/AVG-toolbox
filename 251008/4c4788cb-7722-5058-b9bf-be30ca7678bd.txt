The first frame presents a vibrant city street at night, with a person in a purple beanie visible at the viewer's immediate foreground left, and an outdoor kiosk with a black umbrella standing slightly further left. In the midground, a person in a white coat pushes a stroller towards the left, positioned to the left of a Captain America cosplayer who stands facing the viewer holding a shield, while a Spider-Man cosplayer walks away to the right amidst a crowd of pedestrians, all set against a backdrop of numerous towering buildings and large, brightly lit billboards.

Throughout the following frames, the person in the purple beanie exits the frame to the viewer's left. Concurrently, the person with the stroller moves further into the scene towards the left, and the Captain America cosplayer turns and proceeds to walk past the viewer's right, while the Spider-Man cosplayer and other background pedestrians continue moving deeper into the scene or exiting to the right.
