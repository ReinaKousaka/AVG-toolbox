frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a railway junction ahead, with multiple tracks converging in the middle distance and others running parallel to the left, all beneath an array of overhead wires and poles. Lush, tree-covered hills rise on both the left and right sides of the tracks, framing a distant, hazy horizon, while two small buildings are visible to the left of the tracks in the mid-ground.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the central tracks, causing foreground elements to recede and revealing more of the track ahead. Simultaneously, signal lights at the main junction ahead and further along the rightmost track change from yellow to red relative to their initial positions, and a new angled sign emerges into the immediate left foreground.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a railway track view looking forward, with multiple gravel tracks extending into the distance under an overcast sky. In the foreground and mid-ground, two railway signals with yellow lights are visible on separate tracks. To the left, a red building and a tall signal pole are next to green trees, while a forested hill rises on the right. Overhead electrical wires crisscross above a complex network of track switches converging towards a distant station-like building centrally.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, all foreground and mid-ground objects move closer, then recede past the viewer. The two yellow railway signals move forward and then disappear from the bottom of the frame, their lights extinguishing. A tall black-and-white signal pole and a grey rectangular box, initially to the left of the viewer, approach and then pass out of view. The complex track switches and overhead lines are traversed, revealing more of the railway junction and distant scenery ahead as the scene continuously shifts forward.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, multiple train tracks extend forward from directly beneath the viewer into the mid-distance, where they converge and diverge to form a complex junction. To the left, a red building and a blue container are visible beside the tracks, flanked by green trees and distant hills. In the central distance, another building with a yellowish-orange roof sits amidst more tracks, while a rocky, tree-covered embankment rises on the right. Overhead electrical lines span the sky, supported by poles, under an overcast sky, with "Vmax 45KM/H" displayed in the bottom-left.
end of description
As the train moves forward, the tracks beneath the viewer recede, and the entire scene shifts closer. The red building, blue container, and rocky embankment progressively move towards the viewer from their initial positions, eventually moving past the sides of the frame. A grey rectangular equipment box emerges from the left of the frame, becoming visible closer to the viewer than the red building as the train proceeds.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a wide view of a complex railway junction with numerous tracks converging and diverging towards the horizon. Overhead, a dense network of power lines and support gantries spans the sky, while a "Vmax 45KM/h" indicator is in the bottom left. To the left, a red building sits beside the tracks, with a paved area and distant green hills, and a steep, forested rock face rises to the right.
end of description
The subsequent frames are visually identical to the first, showing no dynamic changes, movement of objects, or newly revealed scenes or objects relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, multiple train tracks diverge and merge directly in front of the viewer, extending into the distance under an overcast sky. To the mid-left, a red-brown building with a dark roof stands beside the tracks, flanked by green trees. Further along the tracks, in the central distance, another lighter-colored building is visible amidst more foliage. To the mid-right, a steep, tree-covered hillside rises alongside the tracks. Overhead, a complex network of power lines and gantries spans across the scene, with illuminated yellow lights on some structures.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the central tracks, the entire scene recedes into the distance. The red-brown building and hillside on the left and right, respectively, slowly move backwards and out of the frame. New sections of tracks continuously appear from the bottom of the frame, moving towards the receding horizon. The overhead power lines and support structures pass above, moving upwards and behind the viewer's original position.
