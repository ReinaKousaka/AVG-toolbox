The first frame captures a snow-covered city street intersection under an overcast sky, with a cream-colored building featuring large dark windows and a red fire hydrant on the left. A dark pole with traffic lights stands at the corner of the building and sidewalk, while the foreground street shows tire tracks and a manhole cover. To the right, a snow-dusted sidewalk leads into the distance past bare trees and towards modern glass skyscrapers, with a dark SUV partially visible turning a corner further right.

Subsequently, the dark SUV on the right continues its turn left, moving across the intersection and closer to the viewer's position. As it turns, the vehicle splashes dirty slush from the street, and additional cars become more discernible behind it in the distance.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a snowy city street intersection, with a light-colored building featuring a "Granville Club" sign and a red fire hydrant immediately to the left. A traffic light pole with yellow signals stands next to it, while a snow-covered road with several cars, including a dark SUV on the right, leads towards distant glass buildings under an overcast sky.
end of description
Subsequently, the dark SUV and a newly revealed black car to its right move away from the viewer, stirring up mist. Concurrently, the traffic lights on the left transition to green, and other cars in the mid-ground also advance forward.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a snowy urban street scene. To the left, a light-colored building with large windows and a red fire hydrant lines a snow-dusted sidewalk. A black street light pole with yellow traffic lights stands prominently in the mid-left. In the center, a bare tree covered in snow stands near another traffic light showing green, with a snow-covered street curving towards the right. Several cars are visible on the street in the midground, with a modern glass high-rise building and other snow-dusted trees in the background to the right.

end of description

Throughout the following frames, snowflakes consistently fall across the scene. The traffic lights on the left pole dynamically cycle from yellow to green, then back to yellow and red, while the central traffic light remains green. Various vehicles, including a dark SUV, move from the right side of the frame into the intersection and proceed forward or turn away from the viewer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame captures a snow-covered city street scene, with a light-colored building on the left featuring a window displaying a "Brass Fish" neon sign, a red fire hydrant, and a pole with yellow traffic lights. A snow-dusted sidewalk stretches into the midground, lined with bare trees, leading to an intersection in the right foreground where a black SUV and other cars are present. Modern glass skyscrapers are visible in the background under an overcast sky.
end of description
Across the subsequent frames, the black SUV initially on the right side of the street steadily moves forward and eventually drives out of view. Concurrently, the traffic light on the pole to the left cycles from yellow to green and then back to yellow. A faint pedestrian emerges on the distant sidewalk, gradually walking from the background towards the viewer's initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a snowy city street corner with a beige building on the left, featuring a "Brass Fish" sign in a window, and a black pole with yellow traffic lights in the immediate foreground. To the viewer's right, a snow-covered street curves away, bordered by a snowy sidewalk, bare trees, and a second black pole with a green pedestrian signal, beyond which modern glass buildings and cars are visible.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the green pedestrian signal on the pole to the right of the viewer changes to an orange hand, which then displays a countdown timer (e.g., '27', '26', '25'). Simultaneously, a black SUV and a red sedan on the street to the right slowly move forward.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The initial frame presents a snowy city street, with a black traffic pole and yellow signals positioned immediately left of the viewer, and a multi-story building extending into the distance on the left. A snow-dusted sidewalk stretches forward, bordering a curving road on the right where a reddish-brown car is present; further right, a second traffic pole displays a green light and a pedestrian countdown reading '14', with modern glass buildings in the background.
end of description
Over successive frames, the pedestrian countdown signal to the right decreases from '14' through '12', then remains at '11' for several frames before reaching '10'. Subsequently, the signal changes to a red hand icon, continuing its countdown from '9' down to '0'. Simultaneously, the reddish-brown car on the street subtly shifts its position, receding further to the right relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a snow-covered urban street scene. To the immediate left is a light-colored building with a grey base and arched recesses, and a yellow pedestrian signal with an orange light is visible at the top left corner. A grey sidewalk, partially covered in snow, extends into the distance, bordered by bare trees with snow-dusted branches on the right. Further right, a street pole holds a green traffic light and an orange pedestrian countdown displaying '10', with a 'W Hastings St' sign and a yellow fire hydrant below. Across the street, cars are parked, and modern glass high-rise buildings rise in the background under an overcast sky.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the primary dynamic change occurs on the pedestrian countdown signal located to the right of the viewer's initial position. The orange countdown number steadily decreases from '10' to '9', then to '8' by the final frame, indicating time passing for pedestrians. All other elements, including the green traffic light and the static architectural structures and snow, remain unchanged relative to their first-frame positions.
