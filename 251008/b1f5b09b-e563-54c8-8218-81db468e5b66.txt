The first frame displays a narrow, bustling urban street lined with shops. On the left, a long market stall filled with colorful plush toys and various accessories extends into the mid-ground, with a man holding an umbrella walking towards the viewer in the foreground. On the right, shop facades feature illuminated signs like "Mask & Skin" and "AVAHair," along with a prominent vertical menu board displaying food items. Numerous pedestrians, including a woman in a black coat walking away from the viewer, populate the mid-ground, while tall buildings frame the street in the background.

The viewpoint steadily moves forward through the street. Pedestrians initially in the foreground, like the man with the umbrella on the left, recede from their original positions or exit the frame. Simultaneously, the colorful market stall on the left and the shop signs and menu board on the right, originally in the mid-ground, progressively advance closer to the viewer, revealing more of their details.

The first frame displays a bustling narrow street or alleyway lined with shops and stalls under tall buildings. To the viewer's immediate left, stalls are laden with colorful merchandise including plush toys and accessories like necklaces, with people browsing. To the right, red-fronted shops feature signs like "TAX FREE," a large dollar sign, and a menu board for "Spicy Stir-Fried Chicken," with products displayed on outdoor racks. Several pedestrians are walking away from the viewer down the center of the path, most notably a woman in a beige coat with a green bag and another in a black coat further ahead. The street recedes into the background, flanked by buildings.

In subsequent frames, the people in the alleyway are in motion relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The woman in the beige coat with a green bag, initially walking away, gradually turns and walks towards the viewer, becoming larger and closer from the left side of the path. Other pedestrians continue their movement, either walking further away into the distance or passing by the stalls on the left. The shops and stalls on both sides of the street remain stationary, while the overall scene depicts a continuous flow of foot traffic.

The first frame captures a bustling pedestrian shopping street extending into the distance. On the left, an outdoor stall displays numerous colorful bags and accessories, with a person in a light grey jacket and backpack standing partially in the foreground. To the right, a brightly lit red storefront for "Mask Cosmetics" features "TAX FREE" and "80-30% SALE" signs, with white display racks extending into the midground. A person in a black coat walks centrally away from the viewer, while further down the street, buildings with signs like "BEANSCONE COFFEE" and "MEDHEAL" line the path, culminating in a large red advertising screen in the background.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward into the street. The initial foreground figures on the left progressively move towards the midground and eventually out of view to the left, revealing more of the street stall's merchandise. Objects previously in the midground shift further back as new sections of the street and additional pedestrians are continuously revealed directly ahead. Concurrently, the "Mask Cosmetics" store on the right expands further into view, and a "SEOUL WALKER" watermark appears in the bottom left corner from the second frame onward.
