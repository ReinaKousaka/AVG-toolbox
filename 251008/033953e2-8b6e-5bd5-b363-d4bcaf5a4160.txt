A tall, modern skyscraper with a distinctive diamond-patterned glass facade stands prominently in the center, extending upwards from the lower-middle. To the viewer's immediate left and slightly closer is an older, reddish-brown brick building. Further left and behind this, a dark, rectangular skyscraper rises. To the right of the central glass tower and slightly behind it, a lighter grey, textured skyscraper is visible. On the far right, a black fire escape structure descends, and below it, a yellow banner with the McDonald's 'M' logo hangs, partially obscured. The upper portion of the frame is filled with clear blue sky.

The viewpoint subtly pans rightwards across the scene. This slight shift gradually reveals more of a circular red sign, which appears to be part of a larger business sign, located to the right of the yellow McDonald's banner, becoming more visible in the later frames.

The first frame prominently features a tall, modern glass skyscraper with a diagonal grid, slightly right of center. To its far left, a darker brick building and another dark skyscraper are visible. On the far right, a dark metal structure holds a round 'INDIA KITCHEN' sign and a yellow 'McDona' banner, while a grey skyscraper stands further back. All are under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The following frames show a subtle camera zoom-out and slight upward pan. This progressively reveals more of the dark metal structure and fully exposes the 'INDIA KITCHEN' sign and 'McDonald's' banner, which appear slightly further away and lower relative to the first-frame's top edge. Crucially, an 'OPEN' sign, previously below and to the right of the initial frame's field of view, becomes visible beneath the McDonald's banner.
