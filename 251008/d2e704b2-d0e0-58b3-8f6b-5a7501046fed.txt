In the first frame, two men walk towards the viewer on a wet cobblestone street; the left man wears a striped shirt and holds a blue umbrella, while the right man has a green shirt, red cap, and red umbrella. To the far right, a dark sign and an ice cream advertisement stand beside a graffiti-covered shop front with glass doors. On the immediate left, a shop with an awning displays various items. Further down the narrow street, buildings with balconies line both sides, and a person on a moped is visible in the midground, facing away.

The two men in the foreground walk past the viewer, moving progressively from the left side of the frame towards the right, eventually exiting the scene. The man in the striped shirt disappears first, followed by the man in the green shirt, who is the last to fully leave the frame on the right. The moped and other distant figures remain largely stationary in the midground relative to the viewer's fixed perspective throughout the sequence.

The first frame shows a narrow, wet cobblestone street leading into the distance, bordered by tall buildings. On the right, a graffiti-covered shop wall features a plastic-covered merchandise rack beside a glass storefront, while a street stall with an awning displaying goods occupies the left. A person on a yellow delivery scooter with a box and several pedestrians are visible in the midground, moving away from the viewer.

As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward slightly into the street. The scooter and pedestrians continue to move away from the viewer, deeper into the scene. Simultaneously, the graffiti-covered wall and the covered merchandise rack on the right shift further to the left relative to the viewer's original central position, revealing more of the glass storefront and its interior.

The first frame displays a narrow, cobblestone street lined with buildings and shops under a bright sky. To the immediate left, a market stall under an awning presents clothing, including blue t-shirts with '10', and various souvenirs, while a woman in a light top and denim shorts walks towards the viewer. On the right, a graffiti-covered wall features a storefront window and a display rack of merchandise shrouded in a clear plastic sheet. In the midground, a delivery scooter with a black box is positioned, facing away from the viewer, with several pedestrians walking forward behind it.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the woman on the left continues walking towards the viewer, gradually moving past the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, the group of pedestrians initially behind the scooter steadily advances towards the viewer, becoming clearer and passing the relatively stationary scooter in the midground. The clear plastic covering over the merchandise on the right side also subtly sways.
