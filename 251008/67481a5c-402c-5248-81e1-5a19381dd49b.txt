In the first frame, a concrete sidewalk extends from the bottom center-right towards the middle distance, bordered on its left by a slushy street. A black pole with a traffic light and a graffiti-covered box stands slightly left of center, dividing the sidewalk and street. To the right, storefronts with closed, graffitied metal roll-down gates stretch into the distance, featuring a partial 'OPEN' sign and merchandise on a rack near the viewer. On the left, older buildings line the street where a black car drives away from the viewer, and another person walks on the right-hand sidewalk further ahead.

The camera subtly pans right and zooms slightly, shifting the perspective to reveal more of the right-side storefronts. The black car on the left street continues to drive further into the distance, and the person on the right-side sidewalk walks further away from the viewer. A yellow school bus subsequently appears on the left side of the street, also moving away from the first-frame viewpoint. The merchandise display on the far right gradually exits the frame as the camera's slight right pan reveals more of the graffitied storefronts.

The person on the right-hand sidewalk steadily walks closer towards the viewer through the subsequent frames. Simultaneously, the white SUV on the left street drives past the pole, continuing to move away to the left, revealing a white van which also proceeds in the same direction. Distant vehicles further down the street also progress, maintaining their relative positions within the original scene's depth.

In the first frame, a wide street partially covered with snow or slush extends into the distance, with a black car moving away from the viewer on the left. On the right, a snow-dusted metal railing runs alongside a sidewalk where two pedestrians walk towards the viewer. Beyond the street, numerous multi-story buildings with varied architecture and some graffiti line both sides, receding into the background under a clear sky.

The two pedestrians on the sidewalk move progressively closer to the viewer through the frames, increasing in size as they advance. Simultaneously, the black car on the left side of the street continues driving further away from the viewer. Other vehicles in the mid-ground also advance down the street, moving away from the viewer's initial position. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the primary dynamic is the movement of existing elements within the initial cityscape.
