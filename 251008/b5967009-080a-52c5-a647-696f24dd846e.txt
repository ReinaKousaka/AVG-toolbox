The first frame presents a wet urban street with a prominent yellow and white striped crosswalk in the foreground. To the left, a sidewalk features a tall blue real estate sign and building facades, while to the right, a landscaped area with bushes and trees parallels the road, delineated by orange traffic poles. end of description.

This gushing water intensifies and visibly spreads further to the right across the road.
