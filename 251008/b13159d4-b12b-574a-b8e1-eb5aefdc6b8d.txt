The first frame captures a long wooden bar counter, extending from the foreground left to the middle-right, with a bartender positioned behind it slightly left of center. Behind the bartender, a large shelf filled with various bottles and glassware is visible, while a large black bowl containing green foliage sits on the bar to his right. A man in sunglasses stands at the far right of the frame, near the end of the bar.

As the frames progress, the camera slowly pans to the left, revealing multiple wooden bar stools that were previously out of frame on the far left. Concurrently, the man on the right subtly shifts his position, turning slightly, while more of the outdoor setting beyond the bar area becomes visible on the new far left of the expanding scene.
