The first frame displays a wet paved street stretching into the distance under an overcast sky, flanked by buildings. To the left, a prominent multi-story yellow building with a red roof and vertical flags, including a Swiss flag, stands behind a sidewalk with pedestrians and a small green area. On the right, a cream-colored building with red balconies features a shop below, covered by a large red awning and displaying merchandise directly adjacent to the viewer's right. In the left foreground, a man in a dark jacket walks towards the viewer.

As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the street; the man in the foreground exits the frame to the left. Buildings on both sides appear to recede backward, revealing more of the road ahead and additional pedestrians further down the street walking towards the viewer. The misty mountains in the background remain relatively stable.
