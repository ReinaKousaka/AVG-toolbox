In the first frame, a black Audi A1 is parked on the right curb, facing away from the viewer. To its left, a cobblestone street with tram tracks curves into the distance. On the far left, a black hatchback is parked further down, facing the viewer, with a white car behind it. A large, ornate building with two Finnish flags hangs on the far left, beyond which extends a street lined with buildings. Bare trees are visible against an overcast sky on the far right.

The camera moves forward along the street, causing the black Audi A1 on the right to gradually exit the frame to the bottom right. As the viewpoint advances, more pedestrians, including several wearing white caps, appear on the right sidewalk, walking from the distant right towards the viewer's left. Simultaneously, more people and a person on a bicycle emerge on the left sidewalk, moving towards the viewer, while a dark car previously parked behind the Audi becomes more clearly visible on the right side of the street.

The first frame captures a city street scene with cobblestone tram tracks running from the immediate foreground, curving slightly left, and receding into the distance. A black Mercedes sedan is parked with its rear facing the viewer on the right side of the street, next to a sidewalk where two pedestrians walk away from the viewer. On the left, a multi-story building with a light-colored facade and red accents displays a Finnish flag, behind a wide sidewalk where several pedestrians are seen, including a child on a balance bike and a person on an e-scooter moving away from the viewer. Numerous parked cars line both sides of the street, with a white sedan visible on the left beyond the pedestrians, and more buildings lining the street under an overcast sky, with a bare tree silhouette in the upper right.

In subsequent frames, the black Mercedes car on the right slowly pulls forward and away from the viewer, gradually revealing a white car parked behind it relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the two pedestrians on the right sidewalk continue walking further away from the viewer. On the left sidewalk, the child on the balance bike, the person on the e-scooter, and other pedestrians also move progressively further down the street, and a cyclist initially near the white parked car on the left eventually cycles out of frame to the left, all receding relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame displays a cobblestone street with tram tracks running centrally, flanked by buildings under a bright sky. On the left, a light-colored building features a Finnish flag, with a white BMW and several other cars parked along the curb, and a person walking away on the sidewalk. Numerous cars are also parked along the right side of the street, extending into the distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, the camera moves forward down the street. The person on the left sidewalk walks further away and exits the frame to the left, while the parked white BMW and subsequent cars on the left are progressively passed, receding towards the viewer's rear-left. Consequently, more of the street, parked cars, and buildings further ahead become visible as the perspective advances.
