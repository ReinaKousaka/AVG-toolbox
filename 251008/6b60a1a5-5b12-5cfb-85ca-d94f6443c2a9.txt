The first frame captures a wet street scene under an overcast sky, with a paved sidewalk and two black-and-yellow bollards on the immediate left, leading to an asphalt road with a zebra crosswalk to the right. Buildings with signs, green bushes, and parked vehicles line the left side, while a prominent dark building with "서원" and "도자담김" signs stands on the mid-right, opposite a grassy area with more parked cars, and a small red-roofed building is in front of the dark building. end of description. Throughout the following frames, the primary dynamic change is the continuous rainfall, becoming more evident with increasing splashes and ripples on the road surface consistently in the mid-right. A person holding an open umbrella is newly visible, walking away from the viewer down the left side of the street, moving progressively deeper into the midground. The overall scene remains from the same static viewpoint.
