The first frame shows a street scene on a clear day with a road curving from the lower left towards the center and distance. To the viewer's left stands a multi-story building with reflective windows, partially obscured by a tree, and people walking on a sidewalk alongside it. To the right, another multi-story building is visible, fronted by a dark hedge and a tree, with a street lamp positioned centrally in front of it. In the mid-distance, the road leads into an area with more pedestrians and a large structure, possibly a station, beneath a bright blue sky marked by a single contrail.

As frames progress, the sun's glare on the upper left building diminishes, causing reflections to shift and a large blue advertisement to become visible on its facade. Concurrently, the "HOTEL" sign on the left building and the "LÃœCHINGER SPORT" sign on the right building become more distinct, while a "P" parking sign appears on the right building. Pedestrians on both the left sidewalk and in the mid-distance continue walking forward, moving further away from the viewer along the street.

The first frame presents an urban street scene with a wide asphalt road in the foreground, curving towards the viewer's right. Two large buildings frame the view: a reflective glass structure labeled "HOTEL ABC" on the left, and a multi-story grey building with "GSCHENER SPORT" visible on the right. Pedestrians are visible on the left sidewalk and crossing the street in the central distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint subtly moves forward towards the intersection, pedestrians to the left advance further left, while others in the mid-distance cross the street from left to right. The traffic signal on the right building dynamically changes from blue to green and then back to blue.

The first frame presents a wide city street with white markings in the foreground, bordered by two tall buildings under a clear blue sky with a contrail. To the viewer's left, a glass-fronted "HOTEL ABC" reflects the environment, while a grey building with "OCHSNER SPORT" on its lower levels stands to the viewer's right. In the mid-ground, people cross the street, with trees visible further down the left side.
end of description
Across subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly pans right, gradually revealing more of the right-hand building and the curb to its immediate right. Concurrently, a dark vehicle emerges from the far right, becoming increasingly visible in the lower right foreground. This rightward shift diminishes the visible portion of the left building and the street scene further down on the left.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a wide urban street scene under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, an asphalt road with white dashed lane markings extends into the midground. To the right, a large multi-story grey building with numerous windows and 'Ochsner Sport' signs on its ground floor dominates the right side of the frame, alongside a blue parking sign with a green indicator. On the left, another modern building with reflective windows and a row of trees line a street, with vehicles visible further in the distance. Several pedestrians are in the midground, near a crosswalk between the two buildings.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the scene remains largely the same from the initial viewpoint. The most notable dynamic change is the green indicator on the blue parking sign, located in the midground to the right, which illuminates to display a green '0'. Additionally, a small green arrow light on the adjacent traffic light pole flashes briefly, indicating a change in traffic signal status. Pedestrians initially visible in the midground on the left move further across the crosswalk.
