The first frame depicts a park scene with a paved path extending from the bottom center into the distance. To the viewer's immediate right, a light-colored wooden park bench is partially visible. On the left, a vibrant green grassy area with tree shadows covers the foreground and midground, featuring a large evergreen tree prominently on the far left. A black metal fence runs along the path's right edge, separating it from a body of water lined with bare deciduous trees and a bright green weeping willow beyond. In the distant background, a multi-story building and part of a white bridge are visible under a bright sky, with a lone person walking far ahead on the path.

The viewpoint progresses forward along the paved path. The park bench, initially at the viewer's immediate right, recedes and eventually exits the frame, indicating the viewer has moved past it from the first-frame viewpoint. The large evergreen tree on the left foreground also gradually moves past the first-frame viewpoint and exits the frame. Continuously, new sections of the paved path, the grassy area to its left, and the fenced waterway to its right become visible, all located progressively further ahead along the path from the original first-frame viewpoint. The distant person continues to walk further ahead along the path, maintaining their lead from the viewer's advancing position.

The first frame displays a paved path extending from the viewer into the distance, bordered by bright green grass and a large evergreen tree to the left. To the right, a black fence runs alongside water, with numerous bare trees, a weeping willow, and a white bridge visible further ahead. A multi-story building stands in the distant background, and a person walks away from the viewer down the path.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the path, causing the person to recede further relative to the initial position. All visible objects like the trees, fence, and distant building shift and grow larger as they are approached, moving towards the sides of the frame from their initial central positions as the viewer traverses the scene.

In the first frame, a paved pathway extends from the bottom center into the distance, flanked by bright green grass. To the left, a large evergreen tree stands prominently, with a white gazebo-like structure visible further back on the grassy expanse. Ahead on the path, a solitary person in dark clothing walks away from the viewer. To the right of the path, a black metal fence borders a lower area, behind which a vibrant green weeping willow tree and a white decorative bridge are visible; a multi-story building can be seen above the distant trees in the background.

The camera steadily moves forward along the path, causing the person walking ahead to recede further into the distance. The large evergreen tree on the left grows larger and then begins to move out of the frame as the viewpoint progresses past it. Simultaneously, the fence, weeping willow, and white bridge on the right side of the path also approach the viewer, increasing in size within the frame. The distant building and background elements gradually shift slightly to the left as more of the path ahead is revealed.
