The first frame depicts a paved road curving left into the distance, with a double white line marking its center and a solid white line on the right edge, adjacent to a metal guardrail. To the left, a grassy embankment slopes upwards, featuring a circular road sign with a diagonal line; beyond this, a steep, tree-covered hillside rises. Dense green trees line both sides of the valley, with a cloudy blue sky visible overhead in the background.
end of description
As the camera moves forward along the road, the circular road sign on the left recedes and then moves out of the frame to the viewer's left. The rocky hillside on the left becomes increasingly prominent and closer, while the metal guardrail on the right continues to curve alongside the road. The perspective shifts, revealing more of the winding road and forested valley that was previously further ahead relative to the initial viewpoint.
