In the first frame, a brightly lit urban scene at night features a large, geometric white building to the left, with people walking towards its entrance in the mid-ground. A large, glowing hot-air balloon light installation is centrally positioned, flanked by smaller lit trees and structures, while several traffic cones and bollards occupy the foreground. To the right, a multi-tiered, reflective structure (The Vessel) is adorned with many winding strings of lights.

Across the subsequent frames, the primary dynamic change involves an adult and child walking from the mid-left towards the far left, eventually exiting the frame. The illuminated environment remains largely static, with only subtle shifts in reflections on the wet ground to the right as the viewpoint slightly adjusts.
