The white car on the viewer's left moves forward and out of frame as the viewer progresses forward along the sidewalk. The A-frame sign on the right shifts closer, then recedes, as a black and yellow bollard emerges on the sidewalk just to its left. Overall, the scene progresses forward, revealing more of the street and buildings ahead while objects pass the viewer.

The first frame shows the viewer on a paved sidewalk, with a dark building and a long hedge on the right, and a street with a red bike lane and parked bicycles on the left. A prominent row of cherry blossom trees with pink flowers lines the center of the street, extending into the distance where a silver car is parked, while various signs and bollards are present in the immediate foreground on the left.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the foreground signs and bollards on the left recede out of view, while the red bike lane on the left side of the street becomes more prominent and extends further towards the viewer. The stationary silver car and the parked bicycles along the left also move backward relative to the viewer's forward progression. Concurrently, a person walking towards the viewer emerges from the distance on the right sidewalk, becoming progressively more visible and closer within the frames.

The first frame captures a city street from a sidewalk perspective, looking forward down a tree-lined avenue. To the immediate right, a dark building with windows is fronted by green bushes, while the left features a road with parked bicycles and a stationary silver car further in the distance. Cherry blossom trees with pink flowers line both sides of the street, extending towards various tall buildings in the background. A wooden barrier and a black bollard with a yellow top are visible on the near left sidewalk.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the sidewalk, causing the wooden barrier and bollard on the left to gradually recede and move out of the bottom-left of the first-frame view. Concurrently, a pedestrian, initially far down the right sidewalk, steadily approaches the viewer's first-frame position, becoming more prominent. The silver car remains stationary in the mid-ground of the street relative to its original position.

From the viewer's perspective on a paved sidewalk, a city street extends forward. To the immediate right are green shrubs and a tall dark building, while on the left side of the street, cherry blossom trees line the path, with a parked car and numerous bicycles visible further down towards distant modern buildings. A person in a dark jacket walks on the right sidewalk, approaching the viewer from the midground.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the person on the right sidewalk steadily advances towards the viewer, moving from the midground into the foreground, while the car, trees, and buildings remain stationary relative to their first-frame positions.

The first frame captures a city street during cherry blossom season, with rows of pink-flowering trees lining both sides. On the right, a masked man in a black hoodie and light pants walks towards the viewer on a paved sidewalk, adjacent to green bushes and a dark modern building. To the left, a street with a yellow square marking has several bicycles parked along the curb, with a silver car visible further down, and tall buildings towering beyond the cherry blossoms.
end of description
The man on the right continues to walk past the viewer, moving from the right foreground towards the left midground before exiting the frame entirely. The camera simultaneously appears to slowly move forward, subtly revealing more of the street and buildings further down the path.

The first frame presents a city street with a row of cherry blossom trees displaying pink flowers lining the left side, beyond which bicycles are parked and a tall building rises. In the center-midground, a silver car is parked on the street. To the viewer's right, a sidewalk with shrubbery and a dark-paneled building extends, with a tree trunk and wooden posts positioned prominently in the foreground. end of description. The viewpoint gradually moves forward, causing the foreground tree trunk to shift left and eventually exit the frame. The stationary silver car then appears to pass to the viewer's left, revealing more of the street and additional buildings further ahead.

The viewer is on a city street, looking ahead. To the immediate right, a grey sidewalk with a temporary sign and a yellow-capped bollard extends into the distance, bordered by a building with horizontal slats and green bushes. To the immediate left, a paved road features a silver car parked diagonally in the foreground, with numerous bicycles lined against a dark, modern building further back. Pink-blossomed cherry trees line both sides of the street, stretching towards the background where taller city buildings rise under a clear blue sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, a person is revealed walking towards the viewer on the far right sidewalk, emerging from the background. Concurrently, the license plate of the silver car, positioned in the foreground on the left, becomes distinctly legible. Subtle shifts in the scene's overall brightness are also apparent.
