In the first frame, a gray asphalt road, marked with a yellow line on the left and a dashed white line on the right, curves slightly to the right into the distance. To the left, a striped black and yellow barrier wall runs parallel to the road, topped by a metal railing, with a green crane visible behind it. To the right, a grassy verge with a fence parallels the road. In the background, a dense cityscape of various tall buildings, including brown brick and glass structures, stands under an overcast sky. Two cars are visible on the road ahead, moving away from the viewer.
end of description
As the frames progress, the two cars on the road recede further into the distance. A pedestrian becomes visible on the walkway behind the striped barrier, moving from left to right across the mid-ground. Subsequently, two more pedestrians appear behind the first, following the same path and also moving from left to right.

In the first frame, a curved asphalt road stretches away from the viewer, bordered on the left by a yellow and black striped concrete barrier where three pedestrians are walking. Beyond the barrier, multiple tall buildings, including a large glass-fronted one and a brown brick structure, dominate the left background, while a dark car drives away in the middle distance; the right side features a lower wall with vegetation. end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the pedestrians on the left to move out of view and the initial dark car to recede further away. A streetlight with a yellow sign, previously partially obscured on the left, becomes fully visible, and additional vehicles, including a yellow taxi, appear further down the road to the right. The distant cityscape also clarifies and expands ahead as the scene advances.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a grey asphalt road extending into the distance under an overcast sky. To the immediate left, a concrete barrier with prominent black and yellow sections runs parallel to the viewer, behind which are green trees and a series of tall multi-story buildings, mostly brick-brown with one glass-faced building. To the right, a grassy verge separates the road from a row of parked cars and further city buildings in the distance, with a street lamp and green sign also visible. Several cars are visible on the road ahead, moving away from the viewer.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the road. The concrete barriers on both sides of the road progressively advance towards the viewer, becoming larger and revealing more surface details. Similarly, the trees and buildings on the left and the parked cars on the right appear closer and larger as the scene unfolds. The distant vehicles also move closer, with a yellow school bus becoming clearly visible behind the white car on the road ahead.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a multi-lane city road receding under an overcast sky, flanked by a concrete barrier with yellow and black stripes on the left and a lane of cars on the right. Beyond the barrier are green trees and tall brick residential buildings, while further right, more trees line the street leading to larger, distant buildings.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the concrete barrier on the left to gradually recede from the viewer. Simultaneously, the queue of cars on the right advances, with new portions of the vehicles and additional cars in the line becoming visible closer to the first-frame viewpoint. The overall street scene, including the distant buildings and trees, shifts to reflect this forward motion.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a multi-lane city street under an overcast sky, viewed from a forward-moving perspective. To the left, a concrete barrier, fence, trees, and tall brick buildings line the road, while to the right, a black Toyota Prius is followed by a line of stopped cars, with a large modern building and more trees in the distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the road's 'ONLY' and arrow markings become fully visible beneath the viewer, and the black Prius exits the frame to the right. Subsequently, the gray SUV and other cars previously lined up on the right also gradually pass out of view, revealing a newer silver SUV entering the frame on the far right. The white sedan ahead and the background buildings remain visible, shifting their positions relative to the advancing viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a multi-lane city road under an overcast sky, with concrete barriers and a metal fence running along the left side. On the right, a queue of stationary vehicles, led by a silver SUV and a blue pickup truck, stretches into the distance, with white turn arrows painted on the asphalt nearest the viewer. To the far left, a tall reddish-brown brick apartment building dominates the skyline, while green trees and other urban structures, including a large curved building, line the right and distant background.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the silver SUV and the blue pickup truck in the right lane progressively move forward, away from the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the viewer also advances, causing the streetlamp pole and the buildings on the far left to shift further left within the frame as they are passed.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a multi-lane city street on an overcast day, with a gray road leading into the distance. Concrete barriers line the left, while a blue pickup truck and other parked cars occupy the right, with apartment buildings and trees visible on both sides leading to taller structures in the background.

end of description

As the viewpoint moves forward, the 'ONLY' road marking on the right recedes, and the blue pickup truck moves backward, revealing new parked cars further down the street to the right. The concrete barriers on the left also recede, with orange construction cones becoming visible behind them. A white sedan, initially further ahead in the center-left lane, progresses past the original position of the blue pickup truck.
