The first frame captures a bustling outdoor market street on a sunny day, with a dark lamppost adorned with red flowering baskets positioned prominently in the foreground, slightly right of center. To the left, a white tent and multi-story buildings line the street, while to the right, another white tent, clothing racks, and ornate facades are visible. Numerous people animate the brick-paved street, which recedes into the background where trees and more distant buildings are seen.

The camera gradually pans to the right, subtly expanding the view of the market stalls and activities along the right side of the street. This shift progressively reveals more of a distinctive flatiron-style building becoming clearer on the left side of the background. Throughout the sequence, people continue to move and mill about the market.
