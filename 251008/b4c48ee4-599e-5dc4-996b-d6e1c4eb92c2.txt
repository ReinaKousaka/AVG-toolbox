The first frame displays a mountain road curving right, with multi-story buildings and a Chinese flag on the left, and a metal guardrail with a tree on the right, all under a cloudy blue sky; a black pickup truck is in the left foreground, and a white sedan is further down the road, traveling away.

As the viewpoint advances along the road, the black pickup truck, initially in the left foreground, moves away. The white sedan, initially ahead, approaches the first-frame viewpoint, passes it, and then recedes into the distance. Subsequently, a new white vehicle appears further down the road, approaching the viewer's updated position along the same path.

The first frame displays a paved road curving gently to the right, marked by a yellow dashed line to the left and a solid yellow line to the right. To the viewer's left is a steep, green-covered mountain slope with a stone retaining wall and a dilapidated building at its base, while to the right, a silver guardrail runs alongside a river, next to a multi-story stone building and a solar-powered street light. A white SUV is visible further down the road, heading away from the viewer, all beneath a sky with blue patches and white clouds, framed by more distant mountains.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the white SUV initially visible in the mid-ground moves closer to the viewer, eventually passing by on the left side of the road. Concurrently, the solar-powered street light and the stone building on the right, along with the dilapidated building on the left, gradually recede out of view behind the viewer's advancing position. Subsequently, further down the road where it curves right, another white SUV becomes visible, approaching the viewer from the distance.

The first frame captures a two-lane road, marked with a yellow center line, gently curving right into a mountainous valley. To the left, a stone wall borders a steep, vegetated hill, with a utility pole and power lines visible overhead. On the right, a guardrail runs alongside a building with a stone base and metal upper story, with more structures further ahead. Two cars are seen in the midground, traveling away from the viewer, while towering green mountains loom under a partially cloudy blue sky in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the road. The white car initially ahead approaches and then passes the viewer, exiting the frame to the left, while the buildings and utility pole on the right also draw nearer and move out of view to the right, revealing more of the village ahead.

The first frame displays a road occupying the lower center, curving slightly left into the distance, marked with a double yellow line. To the left, a steep, green-foliaged embankment rises, crossed by overhead power lines. On the right, a multi-story building with a stone lower facade, a red section bearing a circular emblem, and an upper glassed-in level stands next to the road, featuring a vertical yellow sign. Beyond this, several other buildings line the road, all nestled against a large, dark green mountain that dominates the background under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the buildings on the right, including the prominent stone-faced structure with its red emblem and vertical yellow sign, grow larger and closer to the viewer's right. Progressively, a red farming implement becomes visible on the ground to the far right of this main building. More ground-level details near the buildings are revealed, and the vertical sign on the building becomes clearer, now legible as "上寨民宿".
