The first frame displays a sunlit street intersection with the viewer looking forward down a tree-lined road. Multi-story buildings housing stores like "DAVID YURMAN" (left) and "BVLGARI" (right, beneath a "Rodeo Dr" sign) flank the street, where pedestrians gather on sidewalks and cars are parked or moving in the distance. Green traffic lights are active on both the left and right sides, with crosswalk markings directly in front of the viewer.

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the street, causing the initial intersection and its crosswalks to move out of view behind the viewer. Both traffic lights transition from green to displaying a green vehicle light alongside a red pedestrian 'don't walk' signal, then disappear as the camera passes. Pedestrians initially at the crosswalk corners disperse, while new sections of the sidewalk, a red fire hydrant, and more parked cars further down the street are gradually revealed.

The first frame depicts a sunny urban street scene, looking forward. In the left foreground, a white Camaro is parked alongside a sidewalk with several pedestrians and a green parking sign, all bordered by multi-story buildings and tall palm trees. On the right, a line of various cars is parked along the curb, backed by lush green trees and darker buildings. The road in the center, marked by a white dashed line, stretches into the distance towards a cityscape under a clear blue sky, with several vehicles driving away from the viewer.

As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward along the street. The white Camaro and pedestrians on the left move out of view to the left and behind, revealing more of the adjacent buildings and sidewalk. Simultaneously, the parked cars on the right gradually pass by, uncovering new sections of the storefronts and foliage. The vehicles previously seen in the distance on the road appear incrementally closer as the viewpoint advances.

In the first frame, a street scene unfolds under a clear blue sky. Directly to the left of the viewer, a black SUV is partially parked on the sidewalk, with its rear facing the viewer. Further down the left side, buildings with storefronts and a line of palm trees and streetlights extend into the distance. In the center, a paved road with white lane markings leads forward, where a white SUV is visible further down. To the right, various cars are parked along the curb, and buildings with lush trees and foliage line the sidewalk. A 'One Way' sign and an 'ISATA' sign are visible on the right side.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's vehicle moves forward; the black SUV on the immediate left and the 'One Way' sign on the right move to the sides and behind the viewer. A white Range Rover then becomes the closest vehicle on the left, also moving out of view as new road arrows appear on the asphalt and move towards and then behind the viewer. Parked cars on both sides continually approach and then recede to the sides and behind the original viewpoint, while the white SUV in the distant center slowly appears to move further away, indicating continuous forward motion. A person on the right sidewalk becomes visible and then moves to the right and behind.
