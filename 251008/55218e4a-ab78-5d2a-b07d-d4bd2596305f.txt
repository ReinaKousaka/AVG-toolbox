The first frame captures a rainy urban night scene at an intersection, with a wet sidewalk and a utility pole holding a red traffic light and some white and blue items in the right foreground. A crosswalk and red bike lane are prominently visible in the mid-left, while a blue van is moving left-to-right across the central intersection, illuminated by numerous streetlights. Buildings with lit windows line the background to the left, and a road with distant vehicle headlights extends into the distance on the right.
