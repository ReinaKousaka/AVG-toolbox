The first frame shows a city street from a forward-facing perspective. Tram tracks run along the left side of the road, which has white lane markings including a forward arrow and a combined straight/right turn arrow in the foreground. To the left, there are buildings with ground-floor shops, trees, a red traffic light, and a large Swiss flag hanging prominently from an upper building under scaffolding. Ahead in the center, a motorcyclist is followed by a car. To the right, a large modern building with many illuminated windows (displaying "modissa") is visible, along with a green traffic light and parked cars.
end of description
The motorcyclist and the car ahead move forward, increasing their distance from the viewer. As the viewer's perspective advances along the road, a pedestrian crossing with zebra stripes becomes visible on the right side of the street, approaching the intersection. Concurrently, the red traffic light on the left changes to green, aligning with the green traffic light on the right.
