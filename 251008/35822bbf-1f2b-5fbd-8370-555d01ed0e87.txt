The first frame displays a nighttime city street scene, illuminated by festive spherical lights strung overhead. In the left foreground, a man carrying a brown box is partially visible, walking right. Further back on the left sidewalk, a woman in a red hat walks away from the viewer, passing storefronts lined with decorative potted plants. To the right, two white cars are parked alongside a busy street where a blurry motorbike speeds past other vehicles, with city buildings rising on both sides.

Subsequently, the man in the left foreground moves further right, exiting the frame from the viewer's initial perspective. Concurrently, the blurry motorbike on the right speeds away, also disappearing from view. The woman on the left sidewalk continues walking away from the viewer, moving deeper into the scene along the street.

The first frame displays a nighttime city street extending into the distance, bordered by multi-story buildings. On the left, a sidewalk features storefronts (one labeled "COCCINELLE") with illuminated displays and potted plants in the foreground, while a white car followed by a dark SUV are parked to the viewer's immediate right. Two pedestrians walk away on the left sidewalk towards the midground, and festive orange circular lights hang across the street further down.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts rightward, bringing a dark grey SUV into the immediate foreground and making the initial white car less prominent. Concurrently, the two pedestrians on the left sidewalk move further away from the viewer down the street. Vehicles in the mid-distance along the street also exhibit slight positional changes, indicating movement.

The first frame displays a night street scene with a dark grey SUV parked in the foreground right, behind some metal railings directly in front of the viewer. To the left, a brightly lit building with store windows (e.g., 'COCCINELLE') and large planters lines a sidewalk where several people walk away from the viewer into the midground. The street in the midground center features an illuminated advertising panel, overhead decorative light-up spheres, and several cars, with more buildings lining the right side of the street and fading into the distance under a dark sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly moves forward and slightly right, revealing more of the parked dark grey SUV's side in the immediate foreground, which remains stationary. On the left sidewalk, a continuous stream of new pedestrians appears from behind the first-frame viewpoint, moving down the street past the advertising panel and railings. A person in a light-colored coat notably emerges from the far left and walks past the camera. Cars on the street maintain a similar density, some appearing to shift slightly further down the road away from the initial viewpoint.
