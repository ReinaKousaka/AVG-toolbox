The first frame depicts a paved riverside path on the left, flanked by multi-story buildings with brick and light facades, a black fence, and a distant lamp post. To the right, a river with a concrete wall and railing extends towards a green bridge in the mid-distance, with a domed building beyond under a clear blue sky. A shadow of a person holding a pole is cast on the path below the viewer.
end of description
As frames progress, a woman in a red jacket, initially far down the path near the buildings, walks closer towards the viewer on the left, passing the black lamp post which steadily moves towards the viewer's left from its original distant position. Other figures further along the path and the viewer's own shadow also subtly shift.
