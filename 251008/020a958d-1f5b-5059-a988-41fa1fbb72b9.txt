The first frame shows an ascending stone path flanked by numerous orange torii gates with black bases, creating a tunnel-like effect that recedes into the distance at the center. To the left, two large stone pillars with inscriptions stand beside the path, with dense green foliage behind them and a thin dark pole in the very foreground. To the right, another inscribed stone pillar is visible, also backed by foliage, and a red conical object sits near the bottom edge.
end of description
The camera smoothly moves forward and slightly upwards along the stone path, causing the initial stone pillars on both sides and the red conical object to gradually exit the frame, appearing to move behind the first-frame viewpoint. As the viewer progresses, the orange torii gates previously in the midground and background become closer and larger, revealing more detail in their structure and the surrounding dense green foliage, while the overall scene brightens slightly.
