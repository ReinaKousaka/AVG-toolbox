The first frame displays a bustling city street with a brown classic car parked on the left, next to a street sign and under a tree. A multi-globed lamp post stands centrally, with a white "DELTA GLASS" van parked behind it, and a brick building with storefronts and outdoor seating on the right. In the background, a distinctive white and grey observation tower is visible above the buildings.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the static streetscape remains, but pedestrians, including a person in a red shirt, move continuously further away from the viewer along the central sidewalk.

The first frame presents a city street with a brown classic car and a white van parked on the left side of the road. A prominent street lamp stands in the center foreground, while a sidewalk on the right features cafe seating under a black umbrella, bordering a building with display windows and several pedestrians walking towards the background. Green trees line the street, with the Vancouver Lookout tower visible in the distant background, right of center.
end of description
As frames progress, the pedestrians on the right sidewalk continue their movement away from the viewer. Starting in later frames, a cyclist in a red shirt and yellow helmet appears on the street to the left, riding past the brown car towards the right side of the viewer's field.

The first frame displays a street scene with a detailed black lamppost featuring multiple globe lights standing prominently in the center foreground, adorned with a red planter box at its base. To the left, the rear of a brown classic car is parked on the street, while a cyclist in a red shirt and yellow helmet is visible on the far left, moving away from the viewer. On the right, a sidewalk extends into the distance, lined with dark building facades, some offering outdoor seating with an umbrella, and further down a white van with "DELTA GLASS" is parked. In the midground, leafy green trees overhang the street to the left, and a distinctive white and brown observation tower is visible in the background above the buildings on the right.
end of description
The cyclist on the far left moves forward and exits the frame to the left. Simultaneously, on the right sidewalk in the midground, a pedestrian in a dark jacket and red shirt walks towards the viewer, momentarily raising their arms before continuing to walk further away. Other pedestrians are also seen walking along the right sidewalk, moving further into the distance.

In the first frame, a vintage brown and white car is parked on the street to the lower left, closest to the viewer. Directly in front of the car, slightly right of center, stands an ornate black lamp post adorned with multiple white globes and a 'no smoking' sign, with a red planter box at its base. Behind the vintage car, further down the street to the left, is a white 'DELTA GLASS' van. On the right, an outdoor seating area with black tables and chairs under a dark umbrella is visible on the sidewalk, adjacent to storefronts that extend into the mid-ground. Buildings line both sides of the street, with trees featuring green foliage overhanging the left side. In the background, a distinctive white and brown observation tower is visible above the buildings and trees, slightly right of center.
end of description
A person with long dark hair, facing away from the viewer, enters the frame from the bottom left, progressively moving to the right and closer to the viewer across subsequent frames. This individual's movement gradually reveals more of their back and upper body, eventually positioning them in the lower-left foreground, partially in front of the vintage car from the viewer's perspective.

In the first frame, a person with dark hair, seen from behind, occupies the bottom center. To their immediate left, a brown classic car is partially visible, parked beside a tall black lamppost adorned with multiple white globe lights. Further down the street on the left, a white "Delta Glass" van is parked, beyond which are other buildings and lush green trees. On the right, an urban building features an outdoor cafe with black umbrellas, tables, and chairs, and a storefront advertising "KITCHEN DISPLAY SALE". In the far distance, a distinctive urban tower rises above the city skyline.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The person in the foreground walks ahead, revealing more of a vibrant red, patterned box to the left of the path, which was previously partially hidden by the lamppost. The lamppost, brown car, and white "Delta Glass" van recede further into the mid-ground on the left, while the outdoor cafe and storefront on the right similarly move relatively backward, becoming less prominent in the foreground.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a person with dark hair, seen from behind, walks away from the viewer, centered on a sidewalk. To the viewer's immediate left, a partial brown vehicle and a red mailbox covered in stickers are visible. To the right, a black outdoor dining umbrella shades tables and chairs in front of a building with a hanging sign for "Morgen's Coffee." Further down the street, a white 'DELTA GLASS' van is parked on the left, while other pedestrians walk along the right-side sidewalk. In the distant background, a distinctive round-topped tower stands amidst trees, with a 'No Smoking' sign on a pole to the far left.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses forward and slightly to the right. The red mailbox and the partial brown vehicle, initially to the left of the viewer, recede and move out of frame to the far left. Concurrently, the closest large black umbrella and its tables, initially to the right of the viewer, also recede and move out of frame to the far right. As the viewer advances, more of the dark facade of the building on the right, along with additional outdoor dining tables and chairs, becomes more prominent and moves closer into the viewer's right field of vision.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a person with dark hair, wearing a light top and dark pants, walks away from the viewer in the center-right midground. To the immediate right, a large black patio umbrella partially covers a smaller one, with dark tables and chairs beneath them, and a white framed glass door to its right. On the left midground, a white "DELTA GLASS" van is parked on the street, which extends into the background with buildings and trees.
end of description
The person in the midground continues to walk further away from the first-frame viewpoint. A couple emerges from behind the "DELTA GLASS" van in the left midground and walks towards the viewer. Simultaneously, the white framed glass door in the right foreground opens outward, briefly revealing an interior, before partially closing again.
