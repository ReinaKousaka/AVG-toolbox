The first frame displays a wet asphalt driveway or parking area leading away from the viewer. A white arrow points forward in the center of the road, which is bordered by orange and white traffic bollards on both sides. To the immediate left, a sidewalk with a low green hedge and a white building entrance with stairs and a bicycle is visible. To the right, several cars are parked, including a white SUV closest to the viewer, and a large dark planter with greenery is in the far right foreground. In the background, an apartment building and more trees complete the scene.

Throughout the subsequent frames, light rain continues to fall, creating subtle ripples and disturbances on the wet asphalt surface of the driveway and parking spots directly in front of and to the right of the viewer. No new objects are revealed or move significantly, maintaining the tranquil, rain-soaked ambiance of the scene.

The first frame shows a wet asphalt road extending away from the viewer, marked with a prominent white arrow pointing forward. To the left, a sidewalk with orange and white bollards borders a building entrance featuring stone steps and a parked bicycle. On the right, a parking area contains several cars, including a white SUV closest to the viewer, behind a low red barrier structure with a visible stop sign and orange cone.

The first frame depicts a wet asphalt road, featuring a prominent white arrow pointing forward from the bottom center, in front of the viewer. To the left, a sidewalk bordered by a white rail and green bushes runs parallel to the road, with orange traffic cones spaced along its edge and two bicycles parked further back. To the right, a raised concrete barrier with a red panel partially obscures several parked cars, including a white SUV and a silver sedan, with a 'STOP' sign on an orange cone behind it. In the background, an apartment building rises above numerous trees and more parked vehicles.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the primary dynamic change is the continuous, heavy rainfall. Numerous raindrops are visibly striking the wet asphalt road, creating constant ripples and small splashes across the entire visible ground from the foreground into the midground. The surface of the road appears to shimmer and move due to the incessant impact of the falling water.
