The first frame displays a bustling city street flanked by tall buildings, featuring a large Fresh Direct truck in the left foreground and a black SUV in the right foreground. Further ahead, various vehicles including a white van, a dark sedan, a yellow taxi, and a green bus are stopped at an intersection with a pedestrian crosswalk.
end of description.
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward into the intersection. The Fresh Direct truck on the left advances, progressively revealing a sidewalk with a person on a blue bicycle that was previously obscured behind the truck from the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, the black SUV and yellow taxi on the right also proceed forward, exposing more of the street and background elements that were further from the original first-frame position.

First, the initial frame presents a city street view looking down a wide avenue lined with multi-story buildings under a clear blue sky, with a paved road and white crosswalk lines in the foreground. On the far left, a food truck and trash can are visible, along with a cyclist on the sidewalk, while the rear of a yellow taxi occupies the far right; a black SUV and white van are centered in the midground, with traffic lights overhead.
end of description
Subsequently, the traffic light in the midground changes from red to green. The yellow taxi on the far right moves forward and then exits the frame to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, as the cyclist on the left rides across the crosswalk into the midground. Concurrently, the black SUV and white van, both in the midground, advance slightly forward, and pedestrians on both sidewalks move deeper into the scene, further from the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a sunny city street looking straight ahead, with tall buildings lining both sides and a clear blue sky above. In the foreground, white crosswalk stripes lead to a dark gray SUV stopped directly ahead, with a white van to its left, and a pedestrian walking left across the crosswalk. A green traffic light hangs overhead to the left, while white barricades and people are visible on the right sidewalk.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective slowly moves forward into the intersection. The SUV, white van, and pedestrian recede further down the street ahead, and the overhead traffic light cycles from green to yellow, then fully to red.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a bustling city street on a clear day, with a crosswalk directly in front of the viewer. To the viewer's left, a white van and a dark gray SUV are parked, followed by a yellow taxi and other vehicles, all alongside a tall brown brick building adorned with American flags. To the right, another tall building with many windows lines the street, featuring white barriers, a bus stop shelter, and pedestrians on the sidewalk. Ahead, the street extends into the distance, framed by more buildings, with a distinct, uniquely shaped building visible in the far background slightly to the left of center.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward down the street. The crosswalk recedes, and the parked white van and dark gray SUV on the left slowly move out of frame to the original left side, revealing more of the yellow taxi and additional vehicles parked further ahead on the left. Simultaneously, the bus stop shelter and people on the right sidewalk also move further back from the original right edge of the frame. The buildings on both sides appear to draw closer as the street ahead opens up.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a wide city street stretches directly ahead, flanked by tall buildings. To the immediate left, a dark grey SUV is parked, followed by a yellow taxi further down the street. Beyond these vehicles, a multi-story brown brick building with multiple American flags is visible, leading to green trees and the distinct, wedge-shaped Flatiron Building in the distant background. On the right, the street is bordered by a sidewalk, a bus stop shelter, and several multi-story buildings, one featuring scaffolding and a yellow banner, receding into the distance. A few vehicles are seen moving far down the central street.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the street. The dark SUV and the yellow taxi, initially parked on the left, progressively move out of the frame to the left, revealing more of the brown brick building and sidewalk behind them. Concurrently, the buildings on both sides, including the bus stop and the scaffolding-covered structure on the right, appear to grow closer and become more prominent in the frame. Vehicles further down the street also become larger, indicating continuous forward motion.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a dark-colored SUV is partially visible in the near foreground to the left. Behind it and slightly to the right is a yellow taxi, followed by a brown temporary outdoor structure. On the far left, a multi-story brick building with an American flag rises. To the right, a large white building covered in scaffolding and a green canopy over the sidewalk extends into the distance, with white barriers lining the sidewalk. The street stretches forward, revealing several vehicles and distant buildings, including the distinctive Flatiron Building slightly left of center in the far background, all under a clear blue sky.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward. The dark SUV on the near left gradually moves out of frame towards the front and left. Simultaneously, the yellow taxi moves forward relative to the viewer's initial position, and the brown temporary structure on the left is replaced by a continuous, plainer brown construction barrier. All objects further down the street, including the Flatiron Building, become progressively closer and larger as the camera advances.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A dark grey SUV is in the immediate foreground on the bottom left, partially obscuring the sidewalk. To its right, a yellow taxi is stopped in the left lane, with construction barriers and green trees beyond it. On the right, a large building is covered in scaffolding with a green tarp. The scene depicts a city street extending into the distance, with other vehicles and buildings visible under a clear blue sky, and the Flatiron Building faintly visible far ahead.
end of description
The dark grey SUV on the immediate left moves forward and slightly right relative to the viewer's path. Concurrently, the yellow taxi ahead on the left also advances, revealing a black SUV previously behind it. Further down the street, people appear on the sidewalk to the right, initially obscured by the scaffolding, and the traffic light on the left turns green. The bus on the right also progresses, and white metal barriers become visible along the left sidewalk ahead.
