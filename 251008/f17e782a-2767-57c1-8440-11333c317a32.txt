The first frame displays a narrow stone staircase leading upwards towards a dark, arched doorway with a metal gate and hanging lantern, flanked by beige building walls. To the viewer's left, a rough stone wall has a white pipe and a grey utility box, while to the right, lush green foliage partially obscures a decorative stone archway opening to a cobbled path.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward, making the staircase, the utility box on the left wall, and the central doorway appear closer and larger relative to the first-frame position. The stone archway on the right becomes more fully visible, revealing further details of the cobbled ground beyond it, while the foreground foliage on the right subtly recedes from the frame's edge.

The viewer is positioned in a narrow, light-colored passageway. Directly ahead, a stone staircase leads upwards to an arched, dark brown door with a decorative metal grate, surmounted by a hanging lantern. To the left, a beige wall displays a grey utility box and a rectangular recess below it. To the right, a textured stone archway partly reveals a cobbled courtyard filled with potted plants, while a brown downspout runs vertically along the right wall. A black planter with green plants and red flowers rests on the right side of the stairs, and the number '10' is visible on the wall above the archway.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly to the right across the sequence. Consequently, the staircase and the door at its summit appear to draw nearer and occupy more of the frame. The stone archway on the right opens up further, progressively revealing more of the cobbled courtyard and additional potted plants within it. Concurrently, the utility box and damaged section on the left wall gradually move towards the left edge of the view as the perspective advances.

The first frame presents a narrow stone alley, featuring a moss-covered staircase ascending leftward past a utility box and a dark bin holding a potted plant. To the right, a rustic stone archway frames a view into a sunlit cobblestone courtyard adorned with potted plants, while a grilled door is visible at the top of the stairs.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint shifts slightly forward and to the right. This reveals more of the sunlit cobblestone courtyard, including additional potted plants and clearer details of the distant building, to the front-right of the initial archway opening. Objects on the left, such as the stairs and bin, appear to recede and move further left relative to the initial perspective.

In the first frame, stone steps with moss lead upwards on the left, next to a black bin and a black metal railing. Above the railing, to the upper-left, a red and black planter overflows with green ferns. Centrally, a rough stone archway forms a passage, looking out onto a sunlit, cobbled courtyard beyond, where several potted plants are visible on the ground and a light pink building with an arched window stands on the far right.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly moves forward and slightly downward, progressively entering the stone archway. This action gradually reveals more of the intricate cobbled pathway leading into the courtyard. Objects in the distance, like the courtyard plants and the pink building, appear slightly larger as the camera advances deeper into the passage. Consequently, the steps and the foreground planter on the left slowly recede from the upper-left portion of the frame.

The first frame shows the viewer positioned at the top of rough stone steps, looking down and through a massive, arched stone passageway. Stone walls, forming the arch, dominate the left and right foreground, with a decorative dark metal railing visible on the far upper left. Beyond the archway, a cobbled courtyard with various potted plants on mossy stones is visible in the midground, leading to a curved stone balustrade on the left and a light pink building with an arched window on the right in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera subtly pulls back and shifts slightly to the right. This action gradually reveals more of the surrounding rough-hewn stone walls of the archway on both the left and right sides, widening the perceived opening. The view into the cobbled courtyard and the distant buildings consequently expands, offering a slightly broader perspective of the scene from the original viewpoint.
