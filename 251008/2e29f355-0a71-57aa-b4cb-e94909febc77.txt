In the first frame, railway tracks run centrally from the foreground into the distance, curving slightly to the right. To the left, a steep, rocky embankment is covered in dense evergreen and some bare deciduous trees, with a utility pole supporting overhead lines positioned mid-ground. To the right, a paved road parallels the tracks, alongside several small wooden buildings, including a red one and another covered by a white tarp, with bare deciduous trees beyond them. In the far distance, mist-shrouded mountains are visible under a grey sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the railway tracks. The utility pole on the left approaches the viewer and then passes to the left and behind the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, the red house and other buildings on the right move closer, passing towards the right and eventually out of view behind the first-frame viewpoint. The surrounding landscape, including the dense forest on the left and the parallel road on the right, continuously shifts, revealing new sections further along the route as the train advances.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a train track receding into the distance, flanked by a steep, tree-covered hillside to the left and a paved road leading to a red house on the right. Utility poles and overhead lines run alongside the track, with distant mist-shrouded mountains under an overcast sky, and 'Vmax: 100KM/H' displayed bottom left.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances forward along the tracks, the red house and road on the right recede past the initial position, moving behind the viewer. A previously distant tunnel entrance directly ahead becomes clearer and closer, while dark structural elements, possibly part of the vehicle, begin to frame the lower portion of the view.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
From a train's forward-facing viewpoint, two parallel train tracks recede into the distance, curving gently right. The immediate foreground is partially framed by dark structures on the left and right, with "Vmax 100KM/h" at the bottom left. To the tracks' left, a dense evergreen forest covers a sloping hillside, featuring a power line pole with overhead wires. To the right, a paved road parallels the tracks, bordered by sparse deciduous trees and further forest, all beneath a misty, tree-covered mountain range and a dull sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, indicating continuous motion. Objects on the immediate left, such as a utility box and the initial power line pole, pass by the viewer and exit the frame to the left. Simultaneously, new sections of the forested hillside and the parallel road with its bordering trees continuously emerge from the distant center, approaching the viewer's position, as the train progresses into the curving landscape ahead.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a view looking down two parallel train tracks that stretch into the distance, curving gently to the right. To the left, a steep, rocky hillside covered with conifers and some bare deciduous trees rises, receding into the background; a small white marker pole is positioned near the tracks in the mid-ground. To the right, a paved road runs parallel to the tracks, separated by a strip of dry grass, and beyond the road stands a forest of mostly bare trees, with misty, cloud-covered mountains visible in the far background.
end of description
As the viewer progresses forward, the white marker pole on the left approaches and then exits the frame to the left, while successive tall support poles for the overhead lines also pass by on the left. Simultaneously, a prominent rectangular concrete structure on the right side of the road is approached and moves out of frame to the right. The continuous forward movement reveals new sections of the rocky hillside to the left and the road and forest to the right, consistently maintaining the mountainous, forested landscape. A dark, square object briefly appears in the bottom right corner before quickly exiting, followed by a larger dark structure that slides across the right side of the frame.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a front-facing view along railway tracks curving gently right, with gravel ballast stretching into the distance. To the left, a rocky, moss-covered embankment with sparse trees and a power pole rises; to the right, a parallel paved road is visible, separated by more trees. Misty forested hills loom in the background under an overcast sky, and 'Vmax 100KM/H' is displayed in the bottom left.
end of description
As the train moves forward, the surrounding landscape—including the embankment, trees, and power poles on the left, and the road and trees on the right—continuously shifts, approaching from the front and then moving past the viewer to disappear behind them.
