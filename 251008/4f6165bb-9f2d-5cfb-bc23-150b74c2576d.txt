The first frame depicts a dimly lit building exterior. On the left, a large decorative plaque, featuring the golden number '25' on a dark grey oval within a rectangular frame, is mounted on a light-colored, horizontally and vertically tiled wall. To the right, an open white door with multiple glass panels is set within an arched entryway, offering a glimpse of a darker interior. Further to the right and receding into the background, a series of archways form a covered corridor, with faintly visible wall-mounted lamps.
end of description
The scene progressively brightens, dramatically increasing visibility and revealing previously obscured details. The text "THE ESPLANADE" on the plaque, initially hidden by shadows, becomes distinctly clear below the number "25". A yellow "CAUTION" sign is now clearly visible, attached to the interior side of the open glass door. A black rectangular access panel also emerges on the wall, positioned to the right of the plaque and just left of the door. The improved illumination clarifies the textured surface of the building and the architectural details of the distant arched corridor with its wall lamps.
