The initial frame depicts a paved road curving left, bordered by a light-colored building with dark shutters on the left and a chained barrier with a green hedge on the right. Overhanging bare tree branches are visible at the top right, while a light-green building and a curved roof structure appear in the midground on the right. In the background, snow-capped mountains stand beneath a clear sky.

As the viewpoint moves forward, the building on the far left and the bare branches from the top right exit the frame. Yellow pedestrian crosswalk markings appear on the road ahead, positioned where the road curves to the left in the initial view. The light-green building on the right of the road becomes more prominent, and previously partially obscured streetlights now stand clearly visible ahead and to the sides.

In the first frame, the viewer is on a paved road with yellow crosswalk stripes and white dividing lines immediately in front. To the left, a stone wall precedes white buildings with dark shutters and a large tree displaying autumn foliage. To the right, a dark barrier runs parallel to the road, behind which a light green industrial building stands; a street lamp with a pedestrian crossing sign is positioned centrally in front of this building, and another tree is visible further right. Snow-capped mountains are visible in the distant background, under a clear blue sky, above the structures.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the yellow crosswalk stripes move from the foreground towards the background and eventually out of view, while the large autumn-leafed tree on the left side of the road becomes more prominent and moves to the upper left. The street lamp and pedestrian sign, initially on the right, shift rightward and are passed, eventually moving out of the frame. The green industrial building on the right also moves closer and further to the right, revealing more of its corrugated structure. The white buildings on the left side of the road are gradually revealed in more detail as the camera approaches and passes them.

The first frame depicts a two-lane asphalt road stretching into the distance. To the immediate left, an autumn tree branch with orange leaves partially obstructs the upper corner. Along the left side of the road, a multi-story white building with numerous windows and blue shutters is prominent, with a smaller yellow building visible further behind it. On the right, a long, tall teal-colored building featuring vertical grooves stands on a dark gray base, with a sidewalk running parallel to the road. In the far background, mountains rise under a clear light blue sky, and a street light pole is visible further down the road on the right.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the tree branch in the upper-left recedes from view. The white building on the left draws closer, revealing its entrance and a newly visible stone wall separating it from the increasingly prominent yellow building further back on the left. Concurrently, the teal building on the right also advances into the foreground. The street lamp, initially in the mid-distance on the right, moves closer, and a manhole cover becomes visible in the road ahead. The mountainous background and sky from the first frame remain largely consistent, appearing slightly closer with the changing perspective.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a road extending from the viewer, bordered on the left by a stone wall and a large yellow building, while a prominent teal-paneled building stands on the right, partially obscuring a lamppost, distant trees, and mountains ahead.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the teal building on the right progressively recedes, revealing a concrete wall and a previously obscured lamppost and tree from behind it. A snow-capped mountain emerges to the right of the road, and the teal structure eventually disappears completely off-frame to the far right. The road ahead widens, exposing more distant buildings and a sign on the right, while the yellow building on the left appears closer.
