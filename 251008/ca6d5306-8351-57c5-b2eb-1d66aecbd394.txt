The first frame displays a bustling city street scene, viewed from a sidewalk beneath a marquee adorned with numerous small lights that stretches across the top. On the left, a building with large double doors and pillars is partially visible under the marquee. A group of pedestrians occupies the midground of the sidewalk, some walking towards the viewer (front left), others walking away (center and right). To the right of the sidewalk, a street with vehicles, including taxis and a person on a mobility scooter, moves away from the viewer, separated by blue and yellow rectangular barriers in the foreground. In the background, tall buildings with prominent signs like "Target" and "Madame Tussauds" line the street.
