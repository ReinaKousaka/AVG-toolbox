In the first frame, a bright sunflare and a black streetlamp head are in the upper left, above a tiled-roof building on the far left. A tall, textured concrete wall with a decorative metal fence spans the right foreground, extending towards a large ginkgo tree with vibrant yellow leaves in the upper right, all under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, the streetlamp and initial building recede out of frame to the left, revealing more of the narrow road curving forward with additional structures on its left. Simultaneously, a red delivery vehicle comes into view parked along the right wall, while yellow fallen leaves and painted yellow Korean text appear on the road surface directly ahead of the viewer.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The viewer looks down a narrow, uphill street under a bright blue sky, with the sun creating a flare in the top left. To the left, a row of old, white-walled houses with dark brown doors and tiled roofs extends into the distance, with a blue utility box visible on the closest house. To the right, a tall grey concrete wall topped with a decorative metal fence runs alongside the street, with vibrant yellow ginkgo tree leaves visible above it. The asphalt road between them has yellow edge lines and partially visible yellow Korean text, with a small red cart parked against the right wall in the midground.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the street, the blue utility box on the left wall moves out of the frame to the viewer's left. Simultaneously, the red cart, initially visible on the right next to the concrete wall, gradually disappears behind the wall as the viewer advances past its position. The yellow Korean text on the road, initially partially visible in the foreground, becomes more centered and fully exposed. The overall scene shifts as if the viewer is steadily walking further up the street.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a narrow asphalt pathway leading uphill, flanked by structures under a bright blue sky. To the immediate left, a white building with a brown wooden door and a terracotta-tiled roof is visible, along with a metal utility box attached to its wall. On the right, a tall, grey concrete retaining wall with a metal fence atop it runs parallel to the path, with a vibrant yellow ginkgo tree peeking over it. Yellow double lines are painted on the path, which is also scattered with autumn leaves, and yellow Korean text (likely "No Parking") is visible on the asphalt in the mid-ground, where a small red utility vehicle is parked against the right wall. Further up the path, green trees cover a hillside in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily moves forward along the uphill path. The white building on the left and the red utility vehicle on the right gradually recede from view, shifting to the sides and behind the original first-frame viewpoint. A person walking uphill further along the path becomes increasingly visible ahead as the viewer advances.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a narrow paved path leading uphill, flanked by structures under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left, a white building with a wooden door transitions into a white wall extending into the distance, while on the right, a textured concrete wall with a metal railing runs alongside the path. A red and black piece of construction equipment is parked against the right wall, and yellow Korean characters along with scattered yellow leaves are visible on the asphalt path, which recedes towards distant green trees.
end of description
All subsequent frames are identical to the first, revealing no dynamic changes or newly revealed objects or scenes.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a narrow asphalt path leading uphill, covered with scattered yellow leaves. To the left, a white building with a brown wooden door and an off-white utility box is prominently visible, connected to a long white wall topped with a fence that extends into the mid-ground. To the right, a concrete wall rises, featuring a metal fence at its top, with a red and black mobile lift parked against it. Yellow road markings, including a pedestrian crossing and an arrow, are painted on the path, which curves slightly towards distant green and yellow-leafed trees and other buildings under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The viewpoint gradually moves forward and slightly upward along the path. The white building and utility box on the left, and the red mobile lift on the right, progressively recede from the immediate foreground. This motion continuously reveals more of the asphalt path ahead, including additional yellow road markings and a greater expanse of the white wall and its corrugated roof on the left, which appears to climb alongside the path.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a paved pathway strewn with yellow leaves extends directly ahead of the viewer. To the left, a low white wall with a utility meter and black conduit runs along the side, receding into the distance where a lush green hillside is visible. To the right, a grey concrete wall stands, against which a red and green scissor lift is parked, extending from the mid-ground towards the foreground. Further down the path in the background, more green trees and light-colored buildings with distinct architectural details are visible.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the path, revealing more of the road ahead and the buildings in the background. The white wall and utility meter on the left recede, eventually revealing a white fence. Concurrently, the red and green scissor lift on the right recedes and then moves out of the frame entirely to the right, showing more of the grey wall and the path.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a paved street with yellow and white striped markings in the foreground is covered in scattered yellow leaves, extending towards the background. To the viewer's left, a low white wall with pipes runs alongside the street, featuring a decorative fence section in the bottom left. To the viewer's right, a grey concrete wall stands, partially obscuring a green sign and a grey scissor lift in the lower right foreground. Further down the street, near the left wall, a convex traffic mirror is mounted, and a person in dark clothing is partially visible behind it. In the background, a modern building with vertical white slats and people outside stands on the right, while a lush green, tree-covered hill rises on the left under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly moves forward and slightly to the right, revealing more of the street ahead relative to the initial position. The convex mirror and the person behind it shift further to the left and appear slightly more distant. A dark colored car, previously obscured, becomes visible parked further down the street on the right, beyond the grey wall. The modern building in the background appears slightly larger, indicating the subtle forward movement.
