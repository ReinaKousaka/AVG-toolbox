The first frame displays a gray asphalt road curving gently rightward into the distance, marked by a yellow dashed center line. To the left, a silver guardrail runs alongside the road, beyond which are green trees and a blank rectangular sign on a pole. In the far background, snow-capped mountains rise under a dramatic cloudy sky. On the right, a steep hillside densely covered with green trees and rocky sections borders the road.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the road; the yellow dashed line continuously approaches and passes beneath the viewpoint. The sign on the left draws closer, passes, and eventually exits the frame to the upper left. The guardrail and trees on the left recede, while the hillside on the right passes by, revealing an extending stone retaining wall appearing at the base of the slope on the right side of the road. The snow-capped mountains remain visible in the distant background, slowly shifting their relative position as the road curves.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a paved road curving right, featuring a yellow lane line on the left and a white line on the right. A silver guardrail extends along the left, while a stone retaining wall borders the right. Distant snow-capped mountains are visible in the far background to the left, with green trees surrounding the road.
end of description
As the perspective advances along the road, the guardrail and retaining wall move closer into view. Several green rectangular signs, previously out of sight further down the right-hand curve on the stone wall, sequentially appear and pass. A dark vehicle also becomes discernible in the distance, ahead on the road.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows the viewer on a gray asphalt road with a yellow centerline extending into the distance. To the left, a silver guardrail parallels the road, beyond which are green trees and distant snow-capped mountains under a cloudy sky. To the right, a stone wall adorned with green signs, displaying both Chinese and Tibetan characters, runs alongside the road, backed by a densely forested hillside, with a small black car visible far ahead on the road.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road; the green signs on the stone wall to the right rapidly recede and move out of frame, revealing more of the forested hillside. Concurrently, the guardrail and trees on the left also pass by the viewer, while the distant black car maintains its position ahead as the road continues to unfold.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a grey asphalt road stretching ahead, bordered on the left by a white guardrail and a large leafy tree, and on the right by a steep, tree-covered hillside, with distant snow-capped mountains and a cloudy sky in the background, and a small black car visible far down the road.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road; the guardrail and the right hillside approach, while the large left tree and distant mountains recede to the left. White road markings, including a forward arrow and a right-curving arrow, appear successively on the road surface in the middle ground, closer to the viewer. Additionally, a circular red and white '30' speed limit sign becomes visible on a pole attached to the right hillside, appearing from the mid-ground and approaching the viewer.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows an asphalt road extending directly away from the viewer towards a distant black car. To the immediate right, a '30' speed limit sign is posted next to a rocky, vegetated slope, while on the left, a metal guardrail lines the road, beyond which lies a green valley with scattered trees. In the background, snow-capped mountains rise under a cloudy sky, with a heavily forested mountainside dominating the mid to far right.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the initial road markings and the '30' speed limit sign on the right move towards and then out of the bottom of the frame. A new yellow triangular warning sign emerges from the upper right, steadily advancing towards the viewer's right side. Further white road markings become visible ahead, while the distant black car remains centered but gradually appears slightly larger as the viewer approaches it.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a grey asphalt road curving slightly to the right, with yellow dashed lines and white directional arrows on its surface, leading towards a distant black car. A silver guardrail lines the left side, paralleling a green valley with snow-capped mountains in the background, while a steep, tree-covered mountain slope and a yellow triangular warning sign occupy the right foreground, all beneath a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the immediate road markings and the yellow warning sign on the right quickly recede and disappear behind the viewer's forward movement. The road continues its rightward bend, gradually revealing more of the forested mountain slope to the right and extending the guardrail alongside the expanding valley view on the left. The black car ahead maintains its relative distance as the viewpoint travels along the winding mountain road.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a paved road receding from the viewer, centrally marked with yellow lines, leading to a distant dark vehicle. A metal guardrail runs along the left, backed by green trees and far-off snow-capped mountains, while a steep, tree-covered hillside dominates the right, all beneath an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses along the road, the distant dark vehicle remains ahead of the original first-frame position. New white road markings, including transverse lines and a forward arrow, appear on the road surface ahead, moving towards and then past the original viewpoint. Additionally, a black cable gradually becomes visible across the upper left of the frame, spanning above the road ahead.
