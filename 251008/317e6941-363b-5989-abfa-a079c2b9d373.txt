The following frames show the foreground man moving past the viewer and exiting the frame to the left, revealing more of the street on that side. Simultaneously, the pedestrians in the midground continue walking, primarily traversing the crosswalk from left to right, with new figures appearing onto the crosswalk from the left relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

In subsequent frames, the man on the foreground crosswalk continues his leftward movement away from the viewer, while a new masked woman emerges from behind the viewer on the far right, following him across the crosswalk. Concurrently, pedestrians on the midground sidewalk proceed further down the street, and vehicles on the distant left street also exhibit subtle movement.

The first frame captures a twilight street scene featuring a man walking away from the viewer on the immediate foreground right, stepping onto a white crosswalk. To his left, a street with yellow bollards and moving vehicles extends into the background, while a tree-lined sidewalk populated by several pedestrians parallels it to the right, flanked by illuminated buildings.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the man in the foreground continues to walk further away, revealing more of the crosswalk beneath him. Other pedestrians in the midground also progress along the sidewalk, and vehicles on the left street show subtle forward motion, with no new scenes or objects revealed from the static first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame captures a twilight city street scene with a man in a green jacket holding a bag walking away from the viewer on the right foreground. A wide sidewalk with trees and pedestrians recedes into the midground, bordered by a street with vehicles and buildings on the left, and a large building on the right.
end of description
As the viewpoint slowly moves forward and slightly right, the foreground man advances further away, to the right of the initial frame's position, eventually putting on a black mask. Other pedestrians on the sidewalk continuously shift their positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint, while more of the street on the left and the building on the right become visible as the camera progresses.

The first frame presents a nighttime city street scene. In the immediate foreground, the back of a man wearing a dark jacket, glasses, and carrying a bag is visible on the right. A wide illuminated sidewalk stretches into the midground with several pedestrians walking away from the viewer. To the left of the sidewalk, a street with vehicles and streetlights extends, bordered by buildings, while a large building with textured walls stands to the right. Bare trees line the sidewalk, and a "METRO" sign is visible in the distant background.
end of description
The man in the immediate foreground gradually walks forward and slightly to the right, revealing more of the sidewalk and street to his left. A white bench, initially partially obscured by the man, becomes fully visible on the midground sidewalk, and a woman in a teal coat walks from the mid-right across the scene towards the left.

A bustling city street at dusk is presented from a ground-level perspective. In the immediate foreground, a dark gray recycling bin stands to the left, beside a crosswalk. Numerous pedestrians are visible on the wide sidewalk stretching into the midground, flanked by bare trees and illuminated streetlights. To the left, a street with moving cars runs parallel, and to the right, a large building with vertical fluting borders the frame. Further down the street, buildings with illuminated windows line both sides, and a "METRO" sign is prominent in the center-left midground.
end of description
Pedestrians on the sidewalk continue their movement, with some walking closer to the viewer on the right and others moving further into the distance. A black car and then a blue car drive past the recycling bin on the left street. The traffic light on the left side of the street, initially not red, subsequently illuminates red as a white van approaches it.
