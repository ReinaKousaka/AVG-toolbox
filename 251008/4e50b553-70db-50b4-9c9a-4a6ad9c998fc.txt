In the first frame, a man with a man bun, wearing a black vest, walks away from the viewer in the foreground, slightly left of center. To his left, a black minivan is parked beside a dark gray trash can, with an elevated train track structure running horizontally above it. On the right, a yellow banner partially obscures a storefront, with a man in a blue shirt standing with his back to the viewer, facing another man seated next to a grill. In the midground, a digital kiosk stands on the sidewalk, with several other pedestrians walking further down the street.
end of description
The man in the foreground moves forward and to the left, slowly revealing a man sitting on a white folding chair to the left of the digital kiosk, using his phone. Subsequently, the man in the blue shirt on the right shifts slightly, and another man becomes fully visible seated to the right of the man on the white chair, holding a cup, facing left. The overall street scene remains consistent as people move within the environment.

In the foreground, a man in a black shirt and grey pants sits on a white chair to the left, holding a phone, while another man in a beige shirt sits on a dark chair to the right, holding a cup; a third man is partially visible further right. In the midground, a black car and bicycle are on the left, behind which stands a person in a white tank top; further back are a white car and a large pile of blue and black trash bags on the sidewalk. A vertical digital sign stands behind the trash, with a row of storefronts extending into the background on the right and an elevated structure on the left.
end of description
The man initially visible on the far right and the man in the beige shirt on the right both move completely out of view to the right of the original viewpoint. Concurrently, the camera subtly pans right, gradually cropping the man in the black shirt from the left, until only his lower leg is visible. This pan progressively reveals more of the storefronts along the right side of the sidewalk. Meanwhile, the people walking in the midground continue to move further away down the street.

In the first frame, a city sidewalk occupies the center, with a large pile of blue and black trash bags stacked in the immediate foreground to the viewer's left. Behind these, a white car is partially visible, adjacent to a tall, glowing purple digital sign post. Further down the sidewalk, a woman and a man walk away from the viewer, while storefronts displaying advertisements line the right side, and trees and other parked cars are visible in the background-left.
end of description
As the video progresses, the viewpoint steadily moves forward and slightly to the right. The walking woman and man continue to recede further into the distance relative to the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, the large pile of trash bags and the digital sign shift progressively further to the left and eventually out of frame from their initial left-foreground position. The storefronts on the right become more extensively visible from their initial right-side position, revealing new posters and extending further into the background.

The first frame shows a sidewalk view down a city street, with blue trash bags and a metal bike rack on the lower left, and parked cars and trees lining the left side. On the right, a storefront displays food and beer ads, with a "LEARN TO DRIVE" A-frame sign on the pavement; several pedestrians walk ahead in the midground.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the blue trash bags and bike rack, initially on the far left, move out of view to the left and behind the first-frame viewpoint. The parked black car on the left and the A-frame sign on the right both shift further into the distance ahead of the initial viewpoint. More of the storefront on the right, previously unseen, becomes visible to the right of the first-frame viewpoint's path. The pedestrians continue walking further down the street from the initial vantage point.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a city sidewalk with a tree trunk in the foreground left and a grey trash can nearby, while an A-frame "LEARN TO DRIVE" sign occupies the immediate foreground right, placed before a storefront. Several pedestrians, including a man in a striped shirt in the mid-right, walk away from the viewer down the sidewalk, alongside parked cars on the left and various storefronts on the right, all beneath an elevated structure.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, the man in the striped shirt continues walking away from the viewer towards the right, initially looking at his phone. Concurrently, other pedestrians further down the sidewalk also progress away from the first-frame viewpoint, while a wet spot on the sidewalk in the mid-right appears to subtly change its reflections.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
First, the first frame displays a street scene featuring a grey trash can and a dark car in the foreground left, opposite a man in a striped shirt walking towards the viewer on the right. In the midground, a "Driving School" car and white truck are parked under an elevated train track on the left, while three women walk away from the viewer along the sidewalk, which is lined with storefronts on the right.
end of description
Subsequently, the man on the right moves progressively further past the initial viewpoint and exits the frame to the right. Simultaneously, the three women continue walking further away from the viewer into the distance along the sidewalk. All other background elements and stationary objects remain unchanged relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, two women walk toward the viewer on a sidewalk: one closer on the left in a black shirt and black pants with a purple band, and another next to her in a dark red shirt and patterned shorts. To their left, a white car with 'Skyline Driving' text is parked, followed by a black trash can, a white box truck, and a parking meter. Above the street on the left, an elevated train track structure is visible. On the right, a woman walks away from the viewer, clad in dark attire and a cap, passing storefronts displaying 'Kennedy's' and 'ATM' signs, and a 'Pizza Special' board on the sidewalk. More pedestrians and distant urban structures appear in the background under the elevated tracks.
end of description
The two women initially in the foreground walk past the viewer from the center-left, moving progressively to the far left and eventually exiting the frame from the bottom-left. Simultaneously, the woman walking away on the midground right continues her path down the street, becoming smaller and moving further from the first-frame viewpoint. The parked vehicles and storefronts on either side remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
