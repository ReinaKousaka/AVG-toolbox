The first frame shows a rainy night street scene. In the foreground-center, a person holding a black umbrella walks away from the viewer on a wet, reflective sidewalk. To their immediate left are green bushes, and beyond them, a wet street with distant vehicle lights and a yellow sign pole. To the right, a commercial building with illuminated signs, including one showing '7800원', parallels the sidewalk, with a small potted plant near its entrance.

In the following frames, a second person holding a pink umbrella emerges from behind the first person, walking slightly to their left on the sidewalk. Both individuals then proceed to walk further away from the viewer down the wet street. They maintain their relative positions as they move deeper into the midground, disappearing towards the distant city lights.

In the first frame, two individuals walk away from the viewer on a wet city sidewalk, the closer one on the right holding a dark umbrella, and the one to their left holding a pink umbrella. To the viewer's immediate right, a brick-paved sidewalk leads to illuminated storefronts with signs, including a large light-blue advertisement for "7800원," and a dark planter with greenery. To the left, a darker, wet road borders a lush green bush, a street lamp, trees, and a yellow sign indicating "700m" attached to a pole. The background features distant city lights and buildings under heavy rain.

The two pedestrians continue walking forward, gradually moving further away from the viewer. The intensity of the rain visibly fluctuates throughout the frames, appearing heavier at times, especially in the midground and background, causing increased splashing on the wet surfaces. Reflections on the ground and storefronts shimmer and subtly change with the varying light and rainfall. Towards the end of the sequence, a light-colored car briefly appears in the far distance on the left side of the street, moving away from the first-frame viewpoint before exiting the scene.

The first frame shows a rainy night street scene. In the near-center foreground, two people holding umbrellas walk away from the viewer; one with a black umbrella is closer, and another with a reddish-pink umbrella is slightly ahead and to their right. To the viewer's left, a utility pole and a street with cars driving through heavy rain are visible. On the right, a wide, wet sidewalk is flanked by illuminated buildings, with a prominent glowing white display case in the mid-foreground.

The two individuals in the foreground continue walking away from the first-frame viewpoint. The person with the reddish-pink umbrella then turns right, moving diagonally across the wet path towards the sidewalk on the first-frame's right. Meanwhile, the individual with the black umbrella proceeds further into the scene along the first-frame's left-center path. Background vehicles on the street on the first-frame's left slowly proceed through the downpour.
