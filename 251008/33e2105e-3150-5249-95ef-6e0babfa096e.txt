The first frame shows a rainy city street and sidewalk scene. In the foreground, a dark pole with a rusty base stands slightly right of center, accompanied by a smaller black bollard to its left. To the left, a wet road lined with orange cones leads to distant buildings and traffic, while the right features a wet sidewalk with parked bicycles, a small tree, and a person walking away holding a pink umbrella.

Over subsequent frames, the person with the pink umbrella continues to walk further away along the right-hand sidewalk relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the large blue banner situated behind the central pole slides to the viewer's left, progressively revealing more of its text on the right side.

In the first frame, a wet urban street scene during rainfall is visible. A thick black pole stands prominently on the far left foreground, partially obscured by a blue banner with Korean text extending horizontally towards the mid-ground road. A small tree with green leaves leans right, positioned between the banner and the road. To the right of the tree, a person holding a pink umbrella walks away from the viewer on a marked crosswalk on the sidewalk. The wet road, stretching into the background, features orange traffic cones and blue tarp-wrapped objects near the curb on the right. In the background, buildings with illuminated storefronts and parked vehicles line the left side of the street, while more trees and distant high-rise buildings complete the scene on the right.

Chronologically, the person holding the pink umbrella on the mid-ground sidewalk slowly walks away from the viewer, eventually exiting the frame to the far right. Concurrently, a motorcycle with a rider wearing a bright yellow vest emerges onto the wet road from the left, moving across the mid-ground and then receding towards the far right background. The rain continues to fall throughout the sequence, creating reflections on the wet surfaces.

The first frame captures a rainy street scene featuring a tree trunk and a light blue banner in the immediate foreground, with a wet street extending into the distance on the left past buildings and parked motorcycles. On the right, a crosswalk is visible next to orange cones and blue bundled objects lining a wet sidewalk, with more trees and buildings receding under an overcast sky.
end of description
Initially, a red light briefly appears from a distant vehicle on the street. Following this, a yellow scooter emerges from the left mid-ground and progressively moves closer along the left side of the street towards the viewer. Simultaneously, a blue street sign becomes visible in the upper right mid-ground, positioned behind a pole.
