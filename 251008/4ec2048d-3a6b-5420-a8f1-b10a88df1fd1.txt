In the first frame, the front part of a white and blue police vehicle with an orange vertical marker pole occupies the left foreground. A black utility cart carrying a blue and yellow delivery bag rests on the sidewalk in the mid-ground, center-right. To the left in the background, a man with a beard is visible inside an open building entrance, beneath a security camera. A large stone building wall with multiple windows and architectural details extends from the left to the distant right, bordering a concrete sidewalk.
end of description
The man from the building entrance and the police vehicle disappear from view as the camera moves forward. A yellow stop sign and two pedestrians walking away from the viewer become visible further down the street to the right of the original building entrance. More of the street and distant buildings, including one with an American flag and a UPS truck, are gradually revealed extending to the right, while the stationary utility cart shifts towards the lower-left of the expanding frame. Finally, the text 'WILLIAM STREET' appears in the lower-left.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays William Street, with a partial blue and yellow object in the bottom left, a stone building along the left, and a UPS truck parked on the right; farther down, two pedestrians walk on the left sidewalk amidst distant buildings and cars.
end of description
Over subsequent frames, the partial blue and yellow object in the bottom left gradually recedes and disappears as the viewer's perspective slightly advances down the street. Simultaneously, the two pedestrians on the left sidewalk move further away into the distance relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a city street looking forward, with a light-colored building wall and entrance on the left, and a dark UPS truck parked immediately to the viewer's right. Further down the left sidewalk, a pole with a yellow diamond sign and two pedestrians are visible, while across the street on the right, scaffolding with an American flag covers a building. The paved road recedes into the distance, showing parked cars and additional buildings under a bright sky, with "WILLIAM STREET" labeled at the bottom left.
end of description
As frames progress, the pedestrian initially further down the left sidewalk walks steadily closer towards the viewer, moving into the foreground. Concurrently, shadows on the street subtly shift and lengthen, appearing to move from right to left across the pavement. No new objects are revealed, but the relative positions of these elements change dynamically within the established scene.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A man in dark attire, looking at his phone, walks towards the viewer on the immediate left sidewalk, adjacent to a stone-faced building. Further down this sidewalk, a street pole with a yellow diamond sign and a red rectangular sign stands before another person. A street extends into the distance, bordered on the right by parked cars and a building draped with an American flag and scaffolding, partially obscured by a dark truck in the far right foreground. Tall buildings line the street in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the street. The man on the left continues walking towards the background, eventually passing out of the frame ahead of the initial viewpoint. The dark truck on the far right also recedes into the background. Consequently, more of the street ahead and the architecture of the buildings, including the scaffolding on the right, become increasingly central to the viewer's forward-moving perspective.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a city street from a sidewalk viewpoint, with a tall stone building and a person walking away from the viewer on the left. Centrally, a utility pole with a yellow stop sign stands, while to the right, a street with a parked car further down passes a building with an American flag and scaffolding.
end of description
As the frames progress, the person on the left sidewalk consistently walks further away from the viewer, receding into the distance along the street, while all other visible objects remain stationary.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A street scene shows a tall stone building on the left, a sidewalk, and a street on the right with a utility pole in the foreground. A person walks towards the viewer on the left sidewalk, while a parked gray SUV and buildings with scaffolding and an American flag are visible down the street on the right. Tall buildings line the distant street, which also features various street signs, including one on the foreground utility pole, and "WILLIAM STREET" text at the bottom left.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the person on the left sidewalk walks steadily closer to the viewer, becoming more prominent in the foreground. All other visible objects, including the distant buildings, parked vehicles, and the utility pole to the right, remain in their fixed spatial positions relative to the initial first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a man with dark hair, wearing a gray hoodie, walks from the mid-left foreground towards the right, partially facing the viewer. To the man's left is a long, light-colored stone building, while a paved sidewalk extends forward from the immediate foreground towards the background, bordering a street on the right. A gray SUV is parked further down the street in the mid-ground right, with numerous tall city buildings lining both sides of the street into the distance under a bright sky, and "WILLIAM STREET" displayed at the bottom left.
end of description
Subsequently, the man on the left moves progressively right, eventually exiting the frame completely. The viewer's perspective advances along the sidewalk, causing the gray SUV and the distant buildings, initially in the mid-ground and background, to appear incrementally closer and more central within the frame relative to their original positions.
