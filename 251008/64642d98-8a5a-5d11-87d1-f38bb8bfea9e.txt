The first frame shows a wet, dark city street at night. To the left, a modern building with "TWIN TREE A" illuminated text stands behind a row of rectangular planters filled with dense green bushes. In the right foreground, an LG air conditioning unit sits next to a white structure with Korean text, while the wet sidewalk with a checkered pattern extends into the midground. Beyond the planters, the street appears wet and reflective from rain, with distant car headlights and city lights visible.

Two figures in yellow protective suits emerge from behind the left foreground planters, near the "TWIN TREE A" building entrance. Concurrently, a yellow hose or cable becomes fully visible on the wet sidewalk, extending from the left foreground towards the midground. The figures slowly move further left, eventually disappearing from view behind the initial set of planters. In the distant background, a green traffic light becomes more prominent, casting a strong reflection on the wet street. The camera subtly pans right, revealing a streetlamp and more of the adjacent building on the far right side.

The first frame reveals a wet, tiled sidewalk bordered by potted evergreen plants in reddish-brown planters on the left, and a low green hedge on the right, all under a night sky with a glass-fronted building visible behind the plants and a grey pillar partially obscuring the right foreground. A street extends into the distance, illuminated by a streetlamp and reflecting green traffic lights.

A large white truck with red accents dynamically emerges from the distant background, moving on the street to the right of the sidewalk, steadily approaching the viewer and passing the green traffic lights before continuing its path out of view to the right as the heavy rain persists.

The first frame shows a wet sidewalk with patterned gray and black tiles, bordered by green bushes in orange planters on the left and a lower hedge on the right. Ahead, a street light illuminates a bare tree and green traffic lights, with a wet street reflecting lights and distant buildings under a dark sky. A faint blue reflection is visible on the central sidewalk.

Rain is visibly falling across the scene, creating streaks and splashes. A vehicle with red taillights emerges from the distant center on the wet street, moving closer to the viewer. It then proceeds past the central viewpoint towards the left, continuing on the street. Throughout the sequence, the rain intensifies, with more prominent streaks and circular light reflections appearing in the upper part of the frame.
