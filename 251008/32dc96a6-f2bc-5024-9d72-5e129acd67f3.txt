The first frame presents a street view at dusk, featuring a dark Range Rover SUV parked on the left, next to a partial view of another dark car in the immediate foreground. A prominent blue railway bridge spans horizontally across the upper midground, above the road and distant buildings, while a white building with dark lower sections and a sidewalk with a fallen green bicycle occupy the right side.
end of description.
In the following frames, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly right, progressively revealing more of the white building on the right. Concurrently, a pedestrian on the midground sidewalk walks further into the background, while all other visible objects, including the parked cars and green bicycle, remain stationary relative to their initial positions.

A dark SUV is parked on the left foreground, opposite a sidewalk on the right with a green bicycle leaning on racks in front of a light-colored building. Further down the street, a pedestrian walks away towards a large blue railway bridge spanning the midground, with distant vehicles and green lights visible beneath it.
end of description
Chronological changes include the SUV's brake lights briefly illuminating at the far left, and the pedestrian continuing to walk further away on the sidewalk. Subsequently, a black taxi emerges from under the bridge in the background, driving towards the viewer on the street and passing behind the initial stationary SUV.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a street scene with a blue metal railway bridge spanning overhead in the background and midground, running parallel to a road on the left and a white building on the right. On the sidewalk, a green bicycle leans on a striped bollard in the immediate foreground, with a person walking towards the viewer further down. A black taxi drives away from the viewer on the road, alongside an orange construction barrier.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the primary pedestrian advances towards the viewer, passing the green bicycle, while a second person emerges from the midground behind them, also walking forward and engaging with a phone.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a street scene with a blurry individual in a dark jacket and cap occupying the lower right foreground, moving leftward across the viewer's perspective. Slightly behind them and to the left, another man in a dark jacket and blue jeans walks on the sidewalk towards the viewer, talking on a phone. To the far right, a white building with a gold-colored facade and entrance is visible, while to the left, a yellow "London Bridge Closed" sign stands next to a green scooter basket. A road with parked cars extends into the mid-ground, beneath a large blue metal bridge structure spanning the upper part of the background.
end of description
Throughout the sequence, the blurry person in the foreground moves completely out of the frame to the viewer's left. Concurrently, the man on the phone continues walking towards the viewer along the sidewalk, transitioning from the mid-right to the far right of the frame. He eventually exits the frame to the viewer's right, progressively revealing more of the building facade and the sidewalk in the mid-ground that were previously obscured. The background elements, including the blue bridge structure and parked cars to the viewer's left, remain static.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a street scene with a light-colored building facade and a wooden door on the immediate right, alongside a sidewalk extending into the midground. A dark SUV is parked parallel to the curb, while a black taxi cab moves away on the road to its left. Overhead, a large blue metal railway bridge spans across the upper left and center, with distant buildings and pedestrians visible beneath it.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the black taxi cab on the left side of the road continues to move further away from the viewer. A red double-decker bus then emerges from behind the parked SUV (mid-left) and proceeds to travel towards the viewer's right, becoming a prominent moving object in the midground.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
From the viewer's perspective on a sidewalk, a dark gray SUV is parked next to a black electric charging station to the left, while a red double-decker bus is on the road further left. Overhead, a blue metal bridge spans the scene, and to the right, a brick wall with a metal gate topped with barbed wire is prominent, with pedestrians and shops visible in the mid-ground under the bridge.
end of description
Subsequently, the red double-decker bus on the road to the left begins to move forward, progressively advancing away from the viewer. It continues its movement further into the mid-ground, eventually exiting the frame to the far left, while the parked SUV and charging station remain stationary.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a street scene with a dark SUV parked on the far left next to a black electric charging station, beneath a large blue metal railway bridge spanning the upper frame. To the right, a brick wall borders a sidewalk receding into the distance, where pedestrians walk past storefronts and a green trash bin. end of description'.
Subsequently, the SUV drives forward away from the viewer's original position, revealing more of the charging station and green illuminated panels beneath the bridge. Simultaneously, the camera subtly pans up and/or zooms in from the initial viewpoint, causing the white marking on the lower right brick wall to diminish from the bottom of the frame, while pedestrians continue receding into the background.
