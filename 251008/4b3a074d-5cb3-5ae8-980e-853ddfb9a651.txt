As the view pans subtly left and down, a red umbrella and the head of a person in a white cap emerge in the far left foreground. The scene's lighting gradually darkens, and a stone well structure becomes visible in the mid-right of the courtyard, previously obscured.

The first frame displays a traditional stone-paved courtyard, featuring a white-walled building with a wooden window on the left, and a wooden structure on the right housing a lit window, an open doorway revealing an interior, and vertically hanging red lanterns; numerous potted plants line both walls, and a stone well-like structure stands center-right.

The viewpoint slowly pans to the right and slightly zooms, progressively revealing more depth in the corridor at the back of the courtyard and further into the right-side building's interior, while the leftmost building and plants gradually move out of frame to the left.
