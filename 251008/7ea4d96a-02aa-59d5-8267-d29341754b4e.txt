The first frame displays a street scene with a person holding a shopping bag in the right foreground, facing away. A white crosswalk spans the midground, with a white SUV and a green scooter on the left side of the street, and a black SUV on the right. Buildings with trees, murals, and advertisements line the background.

end of description. The person in the foreground exits right, as the white SUV on the left moves out of frame. Concurrently, the green scooter proceeds left across the crosswalk, and the black SUV on the right slowly advances further right.

In the first frame, a wide street intersection is visible under a clear blue sky. Directly in front, a white-striped crosswalk spans the pavement. To the viewer's immediate right, a dark SUV is parked, partially visible, facing away. On the left, a reddish-brown path is bordered by white barriers with "NO ENTRY" signs. Beyond these barriers, a group of people is gathered near a red car, backed by a brick building and green trees. In the midground, a white pole with a red 'DO NOT ENTER' sign and a 'ONE WAY' sign stands, and two pedestrians walk on the sidewalk to the right, near an A-frame sign and planters. To the far right, a building displays a large black-and-white mural and "Northside" signage.

The two pedestrians on the midground sidewalk (center-right) walk forward, moving past the A-frame sign towards the viewer's right and slightly away. Concurrently, a motorcycle with a rider emerges from behind the white barriers on the far left, moving diagonally towards the viewer's left and away from the camera. The black SUV in the immediate foreground on the right remains static throughout the sequence.

The first frame shows a multi-lane street with a white-striped crosswalk in the foreground. To the immediate right, a black GMC SUV is parked on the street. On the sidewalk beyond the crosswalk, a man and a woman stand near an A-frame sign, while a street sign pole with "ONE WAY" and "DO NOT ENTER" signs is slightly further back and to the left of them. To the left of the crosswalk, a street extends into the distance, revealing parked cars, motorcycles, a red car, and a blue-green bike lane, bordered by planters with greenery. In the midground and background, various buildings, one with a large mural and "Northside" and "NY State Inspection" signs, line the streets under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The woman, initially standing on the sidewalk to the right of the viewer's center, begins to walk forward. She steps onto the crosswalk in the middle of the frame, progressively moving across the street from the viewer's right to their left. By the final frame, she is well onto the crosswalk, still moving towards the left. All other visible objects and vehicles remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
