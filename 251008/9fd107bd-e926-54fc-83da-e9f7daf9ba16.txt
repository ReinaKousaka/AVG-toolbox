The first frame depicts a snow-covered path leading into a dense evergreen forest, winding slightly to the right from the viewer's position. To the left, a snow-dusted embankment with exposed reddish-brown rocks rises alongside the path, while a gentle snow-covered incline borders the path on the right. Tall, snow-laden evergreen trees line both sides of the path, extending deep into the background.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the snow-covered path recedes beneath the viewer, and the surrounding snow and trees on both sides shift progressively backward. New sections of the dense evergreen forest and the continuously winding snow path are revealed further ahead in the sequence.
