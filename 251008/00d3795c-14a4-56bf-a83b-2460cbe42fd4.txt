The first frame presents an aerial view of a rocky, partially vegetated peninsula or island extending from the left towards the center-right, surrounded by vibrant turquoise and deep blue sea, with distant, hazy landmasses visible on the horizon, behind the peninsula.

Following this, the scene abruptly transitions to a completely new high aerial view, now showing a dense green pine forest in the foreground and midground directly in front of the viewer. Further ahead, a valley opens to reveal a clear blue sea and a coastal town in the distant background. The camera then slowly pans horizontally, gradually revealing more of the steep, forested hillside to the left of the initial new scene, which also features terraced, less densely vegetated areas further up.
