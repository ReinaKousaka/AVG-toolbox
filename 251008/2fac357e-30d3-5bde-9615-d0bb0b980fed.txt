The first frame displays an outdoor Christmas market scene at dusk. In the foreground to the right, two small fir trees are visible. To their left, a brightly illuminated market stall showcases a vibrant assortment of colorful small objects and hanging ornaments; above it, a festive garland with lights and pinecones decorates the roof. Further left, a second market stall features various knitted items. On the far left, two indistinct figures walk away on a sidewalk, beneath a string of fairy lights stretching into the distance, with tall buildings silhouetted against a twilight blue sky in the background.

The viewpoint slowly pans to the right, revealing more of the market stalls. The two people on the far left of the initial frame continue walking away, eventually exiting the frame to the left. A person in a blue jacket, initially partially hidden behind the leftmost stall, becomes fully visible, examines items, and then shifts slightly right, closer to the central, brightly lit stall. The rightmost market stall and the fir trees in the immediate foreground gain more prominence as the scene expands to include elements previously to the right of the initial frame.
