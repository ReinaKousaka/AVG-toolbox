A large black SUV is prominent in the bottom-left foreground, facing right, while pedestrians cross a striped crosswalk horizontally mid-frame towards the right. A black sedan is stopped to the right of the pedestrians, with a grand ornate building centrally dominating the background, flanked by tall skyscrapers to its left and a white tent structure to its right.
end of description.
The black SUV proceeds to turn right, moving away from the viewer and revealing more of the street where a yellow taxi advances on the far left. Concurrently, the pedestrians complete their crossing, dispersing further to the right.

In the foreground of the first frame, a black SUV is captured mid-turn towards the right on a city street, marked by prominent crosswalk lines; a person carrying a suitcase crosses the street to its left. In the midground, a yellow taxi and other pedestrians are visible, while an ornate brick building with a dome and arched windows dominates the central background, flanked by skyscrapers and a white tent to its right.

As the frames progress, the black SUV completes its turn, moving further to the right, and the pedestrian continues walking further across the street, away from the viewer. A dark red SUV then enters the frame from the far left, moving right in the foreground, partially obscuring the yellow taxi.
