In the first frame, a paved road curves slightly into the mid-ground, flanked by a dense green hedge on the viewer's left and a cobbled path with varied green shrubs and some pink flowers on the right. Further along the left, a white house with a dark roof is partially visible behind the hedge. In the central mid-ground, another white house with a dark roof is visible, with a tall tree in front of it. The background consists of a cloudy sky with patches of blue.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The initial green hedge on the left gradually recedes, revealing more of the white house, including a brown garage door. Simultaneously, the colorful shrubs on the right give way to more extensive cobblestone paving and a set of stone steps ascending a grassy incline, all remaining to the right of the first-frame viewpoint. The houses in the mid-ground appear to move further into the distance as the viewer advances.
