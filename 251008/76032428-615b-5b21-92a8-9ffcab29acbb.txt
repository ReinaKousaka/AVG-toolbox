The first frame depicts a highway curving to the right, bordered by a grassy verge and guardrail on the right, and a forest-covered mountain slope on the left, leading to a cloudy sky and distant peaks. On the left shoulder, a white van and stacked wood are near a brown informational sign, while a motorcycle and several cars travel on the road ahead of the viewer.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the road; the white motorcycle on the left passes, and a silver car approaches and passes from the opposing lane. A large brown sign on the right side, previously distant, moves closer to reveal "Gorges du Durnand 200m" before receding past the viewer, while the objects in the parking area on the left gradually move further behind the viewpoint.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame captures a multi-lane highway winding into a green, mountainous valley under a cloudy sky. To the viewer's left, a blue car, followed by a white and a dark car, proceed in an adjacent lane, while dense forested slopes flank both sides of the road, ascending towards a distant background where a blue sign is visible on the right.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the blue car passes to the left, followed by the white and dark cars, receding behind the viewer. Subsequently, a motorcycle and a white van appear further ahead on the road, progressively approaching the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a multi-lane highway curving slightly to the right, flanked by steep, lush green, tree-covered mountains under a cloudy sky. Ahead of the viewer, in the left lane, a white SUV is followed by a motorcycle, and further ahead in the right lane, a white van; a blue directional sign is visible on the right shoulder.
end of description
As the viewer progresses, the white SUV and motorcycle advance further ahead and move towards the left side of the frame, while the blue road sign on the right approaches, eventually passing to the right of the initial viewpoint, now clearly displaying "Martigny". Concurrently, the white van in the right lane moves closer to the viewer's original foreground position and advances towards the right edge of the frame.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a multi-lane asphalt road stretches directly away from the viewer, flanked by white lane markings. To the immediate left, a white van moves away from the viewer, partially visible, followed by a dark sedan further down the lane. On the right, a metal guardrail runs parallel to the road, beside a narrow river winding through the valley. Steep, heavily forested mountains rise on both sides, with a distant grey dump truck visible ahead on the road and a small village nestled in the valley further away.
end of description
The white van on the left exits the frame towards the front, as the dark sedan behind it continues moving forward. Another dark car subsequently enters the frame from the left, positioned where the van was, also proceeding away from the viewer. Simultaneously, the grey dump truck on the road ahead moves closer to the viewer and shifts into the left lane, its details becoming clearer.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The viewer is on a multi-lane road, looking forward into a mountainous valley. To the immediate left, a large, silver articulated truck is partially visible, moving in the adjacent lane. Further ahead on the left lane is a green van, followed by a dark SUV and other vehicles in the distance. To the right of the road, a metal guardrail separates the highway from a river flowing parallel, with terraced vineyards and a tree-covered mountain slope beyond it. On the left side, a stone retaining wall borders a dense, green forested mountain.
end of description
The large truck on the left moves out of view to the left and behind the viewer. Subsequently, the green van approaches, passes the viewer on the left, and moves further back. The dark SUV behind it follows the same trajectory, also passing on the left, as the remaining distant vehicles continue to approach. The surrounding mountains and river gradually recede into the background, revealing more of the road ahead.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The viewer is positioned on a paved two-lane road with white markings, extending forward and curving slightly left in the distance. To the left, a steep, tree-covered mountain slope rises, bordered by a low stone wall, with a small cluster of buildings partially visible further ahead. To the right, a metal guardrail separates the road from a river, beyond which a vineyard-covered mountain slope ascends into the background. Ahead in the oncoming lane, a white SUV and a blue car are visible.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the white SUV and blue car, initially ahead in the oncoming lane, progressively approach and pass to the left of the first-frame viewpoint. The buildings on the left side of the road, previously distant, become clearer and appear directly to the left as the viewer passes them, revealing a street light pole and additional parked cars nearby. The perspective of the river and vineyard-covered mountain to the right also shifts, showing more of their extent as the viewer progresses further along the road.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a paved road extends directly away from the viewer towards the center, bordered by a white dashed line on the left and a solid white line on the right. To the immediate right, a metal guardrail parallels the road, beyond which a lush, green hillside covered with trees and vineyards rises steeply. On the left, another paved road branches off, bordered by a dark gray van parked prominently near the foreground, adjacent to several buildings. Further left and behind the van, more buildings are visible, and a tall streetlight stands on the left side of the main road. Distant mountains are visible in the background, topped by a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward along the main road. The dark gray van and a smaller white car on the left move forward and eventually out of frame to the left and behind the initial viewpoint. Simultaneously, a dark blue car approaches from further ahead on the main road, eventually passing to the left of the viewer. Later, a dark SUV-like vehicle emerges from the left-side road, cutting across the viewer's path before moving to the right of the main road. The buildings and streetlights on the left, and the guardrail on the right, progressively recede from the foreground as the viewpoint advances.
