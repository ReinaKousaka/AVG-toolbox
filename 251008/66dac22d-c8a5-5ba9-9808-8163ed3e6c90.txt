In the first frame, three men are in the immediate foreground, walking away from the viewer on a pedestrian crossing. To their left, a storefront with a green awning and "KOREAN GINSENG" signs is visible, while to their right, a man in a yellow vest walks next to a parked scooter, with orange traffic cones further ahead. Buildings line both sides of the street, with a large stone structure featuring a bonsai mural on the right, and reflective glass buildings with multiple store signs on the left. In the midground, numerous pedestrians walk down the bustling street towards a distinct dome-roofed building and modern skyscrapers in the distant background, all under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the three foreground men and the man in the yellow vest continue walking *further away* from the first-frame viewpoint. The initial sections of the storefronts on the left and the stone wall on the right gradually move *to the sides and then behind* the first-frame viewpoint. New portions of the street, shops, and pedestrians *further along the path* are continuously revealed ahead. The orange traffic cones and the parked scooter are progressively *passed by* the first-frame viewpoint, appearing to move *behind* its original position. The distant dome-roofed building and skyscrapers become *progressively larger* as the viewer approaches them, still remaining *ahead* of the initial viewpoint.
