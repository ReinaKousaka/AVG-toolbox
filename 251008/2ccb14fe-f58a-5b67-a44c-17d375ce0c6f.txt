A vibrant turquoise river flows through a deep rocky canyon, rushing towards the viewer from the upper left before veering right at the bottom. Steep, tree-dotted cliffs flank the river; the left cliff is closer and taller, while the right displays distinct horizontal rock layers. Dense green coniferous forests stretch above the canyon, leading to distant snow-capped mountains under a blue, cloudy sky in the background.
end of description
The camera gradually descends and moves forward into the canyon, revealing more of the turbulent river and its intensifying whitewater directly below and further into the ravine. As the viewpoint shifts lower, the canyon walls become more imposing and detailed, extending further down the frame relative to the initial perspective.
