The first frame shows the viewer on a train track facing forward, with the tracks leading into a brightly lit tunnel ahead. To the left, a large concrete arch structure curves away, containing a wet road surface, while a dark, forested mountain rises in the background. To the right, a moss-covered rocky embankment parallels the tracks, and above the tunnel entrance, overhead electrical wires and supports are visible; "Vmax: 80KM/h" is displayed at the bottom-left.
end of description
The camera progressively moves forward, approaching and entering the first tunnel arch, causing the external landscape (the concrete arch on the left and the rocky embankment on the right) to recede from view. As the viewer enters the tunnel, its arched stone walls become the primary visual, with the internal electrical lines passing overhead. The view deepens into the tunnel, revealing a darker, smaller tunnel opening further ahead as the surrounding environment blurs with motion.
