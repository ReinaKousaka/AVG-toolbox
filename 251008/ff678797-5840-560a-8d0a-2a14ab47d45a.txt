The first frame presents a paved road extending into a village nestled beneath towering, snow-capped mountains against a clear blue sky. A white building with a hedge stands to the immediate left, while a reddish-brown multi-story house with brown shutters is prominent on the right; a light pole and other houses are visible further down the road.

As the viewpoint advances, the reddish-brown building on the right moves out of the initial frame's field of view, while a lighter-colored house with red shutters, initially further down the road to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, gradually comes into full view and becomes increasingly prominent as it approaches the location of the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, a gray car, originally parked further down the left street from the first-frame viewpoint, becomes more prominent. A wooden signpost topped with a white rabbit then emerges on the right, also approaching the first-frame viewpoint from its initial position further down the road and becoming clearer.

The first frame depicts a paved road leading into a small village nestled within a mountainous landscape under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left, a light-colored house with a red roof is partially obscured by green hedges, with a dark grey car parked in front of it. On the right, a two-story light-colored house with a brown roof and red shutters stands behind a bare-branched tree and a chain-link fence, with a larger yellow-brown building further down the road. Snow-capped mountains dominate the background, and a white rabbit-shaped sign with 'FABIEN' is visible on the far right mountain slope.
end of description.
As the viewpoint moves forward, the dark grey car on the left side of the road progresses closer before exiting the frame to the left. The houses on both the left and right sides similarly move closer, revealing more of their facades and lower sections, eventually beginning to exit the frame to their respective sides. The chain-link fence on the right also moves past, and the white rabbit sign, initially on the far right mountain, disappears entirely to the right. The yellow-brown building further down the road becomes larger as it is approached.

In the first frame, the viewer faces a village road flanked by houses, with a stone wall and a white house to the left, and a white house with red shutters to the right. A prominent yellow house stands in the mid-ground, while majestic snow-capped mountains rise directly ahead in the background beneath a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the white house on the right recedes, revealing a carport with a white vehicle. A lamppost emerges from behind the left house and moves towards the center-left, and the stone wall on the left edge eventually transitions into a hedge. The distant mountains remain constant in the background as the foreground elements shift to the left and right.

The first frame depicts a paved road curving through a village towards snow-capped mountains under a clear blue sky. On the left are a white house with solar panels and a parked SUV, a dark wooden building, and a lamppost in the foreground, while a large yellow building with numerous windows occupies the right foreground.
end of description
As the camera moves forward along the road, the lamppost on the far left gradually exits the frame. The yellow building on the right recedes and shifts further right, revealing more of its lower facade and the ground beside it. Concurrently, the white house and the parked white SUV on the left shift further left and slightly back, unveiling a set of stairs leading to its entrance. The dark wooden building also moves left relative to the center, while the background mountains appear slightly more prominent as the foreground structures recede.
