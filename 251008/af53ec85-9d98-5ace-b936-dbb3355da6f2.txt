In the first frame, a wet paved street occupies the lower half of the view. On the left, two men walk towards the viewer, followed by a larger group of pedestrians walking away from the viewer towards the mid-left. To the right, a building with a stone facade features a rustic-looking shop entrance with a red awning, adorned with snowy branches and a wooden reindeer figure, alongside a large shop window. The street extends into the background, lined with multi-story buildings, some with green shutters, under an overcast sky, with a large snowflake decoration visible in the distance overhead.

As the frames progress, the pedestrians in the mid-left and the man with the black umbrella move further away from the viewer, deeper into the scene, congregating near the rustic shop entrance on the right. Simultaneously, the two men on the far left walk towards the left edge of the frame, eventually exiting the scene. A person in a bright yellow jacket becomes more visible as they move towards the right, joining the group by the shop entrance. The rest of the background structures and decor remain stationary.

The first frame displays a winter street scene with a group of people walking away from the viewer on the left, one prominently holding a black umbrella, while another group stands near a decorated shop entrance on the right. The shop entrance, in the midground, features a red awning, a wooden hut-like structure, a wooden deer figurine, and planter boxes filled with frosted white foliage. Further down the street in the background, more buildings and street decorations like a snowflake are visible.

As the sequence progresses, the group of people on the left side of the street continuously moves forward, walking further away from the viewer. This movement gradually reveals more of the street ahead and additional shopfronts with outdoor seating to the far left in the background, which were partially obscured. The individuals standing near the shop entrance on the right exhibit only minor shifts in their positions and postures.
