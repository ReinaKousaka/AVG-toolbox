The first frame displays a curved asphalt road in the foreground, leading towards a two-story building with a wooden upper facade and solar panels on its roof, positioned to the right of the viewer. To the left of the building, several white hay bales are stacked on a grassy patch, while steep, forested mountains rise to the left and behind the building, under a bright sun in the upper-left sky.

As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the building and hay bales to the right become larger and more prominent. A blue car, initially partially obscured by the hay bales, is progressively revealed and becomes fully visible parked near the building. The road's curve becomes more pronounced, and more of the driveway and a stone retaining wall to the right of the road are unveiled.
