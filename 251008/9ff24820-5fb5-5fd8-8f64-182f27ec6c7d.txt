A wet street scene at night is visible, with rain falling. To the immediate right, the rear and side of a light-colored car with a red taillight occupy the foreground. To the left, a white building with an external staircase and a dark railing descends toward the lower left, featuring an AC unit on its wall. In the midground, a dark-leafed tree stands before a building with a lit interior entryway and a horizontal, slatted facade, adjacent to a planter box. A streetlight illuminates the wet ground, and an alleyway ascends into the dimly lit background to the right.

The car on the right slowly moves forward, gradually revealing more of the wet street and the curving alleyway extending uphill into the background on the right. As the car exits the frame, the camera's viewpoint subtly pans right, further opening up the view of the street and distant buildings, while the structures on the left remain stationary.

In the first frame, a wet, dark asphalt street stretches from the bottom center towards a junction in the mid-ground. To the viewer's left, a low concrete barrier runs parallel to the street, with a planter containing dark foliage beside it. Further left, a building facade with a brightly illuminated, bluish-white window and a dark tree in front is visible. A utility pole stands slightly right of center in the mid-ground. To the right of the pole, another building with an awning and foliage sits, leading into a narrower, dark alleyway receding into the background on the right.

Over the subsequent frames, the primary light source from the building on the left side of the street dynamically changes from a bluish-white to an increasingly vibrant yellow-orange hue. This shift in light color is prominently reflected on the wet ground directly in front of the viewer and extending into the mid-ground, transforming the cool reflections into warm, golden pools. The intensity of this yellow-orange illumination steadily brightens, casting a stronger glow on the left side of the scene and across the wet pavement by the final frame.
