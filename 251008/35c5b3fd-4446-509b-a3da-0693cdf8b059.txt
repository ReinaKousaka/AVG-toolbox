The initial frame displays a bright village scene with a red utility vehicle carrying lumber on the grassy left foreground, partially marked with yellow tape. A paved road curves from the immediate foreground into the mid-ground, bordered by a small wooden garage to the right and traditional chalet-style buildings, including one under scaffolding, further back. A steep, forested mountain rises in the background right under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the red vehicle gradually exits to the left, revealing a white van and more of the grassy area behind it, while a manhole cover appears in the paved road. The small wooden garage on the right becomes more prominent, and a wooden fence to its right moves out of frame. The overall perspective advances through the village as distant structures subtly shift their relative positions.
