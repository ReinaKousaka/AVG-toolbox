A wet paved road curves into the distance on the left, bordered by a white guardrail that separates it from a narrow, stone-walled canal carrying flowing water to the right. Lush green tree branches heavily frame the right foreground, obscuring a light-colored building further back, while dense green trees cover a hillside on the far left under an overcast sky.
end of description
The camera executes a subtle, slow pan to the right and slightly downward. This motion causes the foreground leaves to shift, gradually revealing more of the canal's stonework and the light-colored building further to the right of the initial frame's perspective.
