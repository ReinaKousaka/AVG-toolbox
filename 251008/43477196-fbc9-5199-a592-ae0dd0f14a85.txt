In the first frame, a man in a light blue shirt is seen from behind, standing on a tiled outdoor patio beyond two dark door frames, looking towards a cityscape across a body of water, with green foliage in a planter to his left.
end of description
The man progressively turns towards the viewer from the patio, first revealing his left profile, then fully facing forward, resting his right hand on the right door frame, and showing a small microphone on his chest. He subsequently raises his left hand in a gesturing motion, then spreads both hands outwards, all while maintaining his position directly in front of the viewer on the patio.

A man in a teal shirt stands centrally on a tiled patio, facing the viewer with open palms. To his left, green foliage is in a planter beside a metal mesh railing, beyond which lush trees meet a wide river. Across the river, a distant city skyline with numerous skyscrapers, including a prominent slender tower, spans the background under a blue sky, while a reflective glass door is visible to the man's right.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the man remains centrally positioned relative to the first-frame viewpoint, dynamically changing his facial expressions and gesturing with his hands, while the background city skyline and water view remain constant behind him.
