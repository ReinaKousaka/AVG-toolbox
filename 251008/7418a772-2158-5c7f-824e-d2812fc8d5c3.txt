The first frame displays a street looking forward, with a grey asphalt road and a white pedestrian crossing directly in the foreground. To the left, a sidewalk features a large tree, a multi-story building with balconies, and parked cars, while on the right, a cobblestone sidewalk leads to another multi-story building with an awning, a stone fountain, and a white van. Both sides have flower boxes. In the distance, the street converges towards mountains under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the pedestrian crossing quickly recedes and exits the lower frame, followed by the stone fountain on the right. A large wooden flower box and then a tall black lamp post are subsequently revealed and move into the right foreground. Concurrently, a person on a bicycle appears on the left sidewalk, riding towards the viewpoint. Several people also emerge standing on the right sidewalk further down the street. The cyclist on the left continues to draw closer to the viewer, eventually passing very near the viewpoint.

The first frame displays a paved street leading into a mountain town under a cloudy sky, flanked by multi-story buildings. On the left, several parked cars are visible, including a silver van-like vehicle, along with a cyclist partially in the foreground. On the right, a white van is parked, and a small group of people stand near a building entrance.

end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the cyclist, the silver van-like car, and the people on the right progressively move out of frame, receding behind the viewer's initial position. This forward motion continuously reveals more of the street ahead, including additional parked vehicles and buildings deeper into the town on both sides.

The first frame presents a street leading forward, bordered by multi-story buildings on both sides; a black car is parked on the left, and a silver van is parked on the right, with mountains visible in the distance. end of description. The silver van on the right moves forward and out of view, revealing a black car previously parked behind it (from the first-frame viewpoint), which then also moves forward, making a white van visible further down the right side relative to the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, the black car on the left moves forward and out of frame, as the scene progresses down the street, revealing more of the town and distant buildings ahead.
