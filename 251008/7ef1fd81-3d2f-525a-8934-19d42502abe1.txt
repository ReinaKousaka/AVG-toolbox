The first frame depicts a sunny, multi-lane urban road from a vehicle's perspective. Immediately to the viewer's right, the rear of a white car is visible, slightly ahead. Directly ahead and slightly left, a light blue sedan occupies the central lane. To the viewer's left, a white metal barrier separates the main road from a parallel lane, where a white SUV is visible, backed by tall buildings. To the viewer's right, a tree-lined median with streetlights and red decorative fixtures runs alongside the road. A circular navigation map is overlaid in the top-left corner, showing a blue arrow indicating the current position on a yellow route.

end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the road. The white car on the right advances further ahead and slightly to the right, while the light blue car in front also moves forward, maintaining its relative position in the lane. On the far left, the white SUV and other vehicles continue to move forward and eventually out of the frame. The navigation map concurrently shows the blue arrow moving along the yellow path, confirming the continuous forward motion.

The first frame shows a multi-lane road on a clear, sunny day, viewed from a vehicle. Directly in front and slightly to the right, a light blue and silver sedan occupies a lane. To its left, a white metal barrier separates another lane of traffic, where several cars are visible, alongside tall apartment buildings lining the street. To the right, green trees and streetlights with red decorative elements run parallel to the road, beneath an overhead gantry displaying multiple blue traffic signs. A circular navigation map is overlaid in the top-left corner.
end of description
The viewer's vehicle and the light blue sedan in front slowly move forward on the road. On the far-left lane, a white car progresses from the mid-distance towards and past the viewer's left. Concurrently, the second traffic sign from the left on the overhead gantry, directly ahead, changes its arrow indication from blue to yellow/amber.

The first frame displays a multi-lane city road on a sunny day. Directly ahead of the viewer, slightly to the right, is a light blue and silver sedan. To the immediate left, a white barrier separates the viewer's lane from another lane containing several cars, beyond which towering city buildings rise. An overhead gantry directly above the road features multiple blue straight-arrow signs and a central yellow dynamic sign showing Chinese characters. To the right, a tree-lined median borders the road, with more distant vehicles visible ahead, and a circular navigation map is overlaid in the top-left corner.
end of description
The light blue and silver sedan ahead moves forward along the road, and simultaneously, the central yellow dynamic sign on the overhead gantry changes its display, first revealing "可变车道" (variable lane), and later numbers "1", "2", "3". Cars on the left also advance, moving further away from the viewer. A new dark-colored car gradually appears on the far right side of the road, becoming more visible as it also moves forward.

The first frame depicts a sunny urban roadway. Directly in front of the viewer, slightly to the right, is a light blue and silver car with a roof-mounted sign, facing away. To the viewer's immediate left, a white barrier separates the current lane from an adjacent multi-lane road where a white Mercedes-Benz and other vehicles are moving away. On the far left, tall residential buildings are visible behind trees, while lush green trees line the right side of the road, extending into the distance. A navigation map overlay is positioned in the top-left corner of the screen.
end of description
In the following frames, the light blue and silver car in front of the viewer remains largely stationary. The white Mercedes-Benz on the left lane moves forward relative to the first-frame viewpoint, and a green and white bus emerges from further back on the left, subsequently moving forward past the initial position of the Mercedes-Benz. Other vehicles on both sides of the road also advance further into the distance, maintaining their positions relative to the moving traffic.

The first frame depicts a light blue car (AA T5487) directly ahead of the viewer on a multi-lane city road, with a white barrier to the left separating lanes where a red and white bus and tall buildings are visible, and other cars are further ahead on the right. end of description. Progressively, the bus on the left moves away, revealing a white car and a light grey van advancing closer from the viewer's left side, while a white sedan on the far right also approaches from the distance, with the car directly in front remaining stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a street scene with the viewer positioned behind a light blue and silver sedan bearing license plate "4A T5487", which is centrally located ahead. To the left, a white metal barrier separates the viewer's lane from an adjacent lane where a white van and other vehicles are present, backed by a row of tall high-rise buildings extending into the distance. In the upper left corner, a circular navigation map overlay is visible. To the right, a multi-lane road extends forward with a white sedan in the rightmost lane, lined by streetlights, trees, and a median with vegetation, all under a clear blue sky.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the white van to the far left of the first-frame viewpoint begins to move forward, and a white car in the same lane also advances. Concurrently, a black SUV appears from behind the white sedan in the rightmost lane and proceeds forward. The white sedan to the right of the initial viewpoint also moves ahead. Vehicles further down the left lane continue to advance.
