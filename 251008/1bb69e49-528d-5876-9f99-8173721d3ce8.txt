The first frame shows a rainy street with a wet asphalt road, marked with white and yellow lines, extending from the foreground. A dark car is partially visible to the viewer's near right, while green bushes line the far left. In the hazy distance, two cars with headlights approach, and several vehicles are parked along the right. end of description. As rain falls steadily, a white sedan emerges from the viewer's left foreground, traveling diagonally across the road and passing towards the right background. It splashes water as it moves, followed by a white SUV/sedan continuing the traffic flow away from the viewer.

On a wet, rainy road, the front of a black car is prominent in the foreground to the right, followed by a white SUV, a red sedan, and a blue pickup truck parked along the right curb. In the left lane, a white sedan is moving away from the viewer, while a white SUV approaches from the distant background behind it. Yellow crosswalk markings and "4-9-10" are visible on the road, with traffic lights overhead and trees lining the distant road.
end of description
As the viewpoint subtly moves forward, the black car on the right begins to shift out of view behind the initial first-frame position, replaced by newer sections of the road marked "4-9-11" and "4-9-12." Simultaneously, the initial white sedan in the left lane exits the scene to the distant left, and a grey/silver sedan then enters from the distant background, steadily approaching the viewer in the same lane, followed by a darker vehicle.

The first frame captures a rainy street intersection from a low angle. In the immediate foreground, a worn yellow and white pedestrian crossing spans the road, and the front right corner of a white car is visible at the bottom right. To the right, a red car is parked, with a blue truck positioned further behind it. In the midground, a dark grey car approaches on the left lane, and a lighter-colored car is visible further back, all on a wet, reflective road. The background features trees lining the street, a distant traffic light showing yellow, and faint buildings under an overcast sky, with rain visibly falling throughout the scene.
end of description
As the frames progress, the dark grey car on the left moves forward, crossing the pedestrian stripes and passing further away from the viewer. Concurrently, the lighter-colored car behind it also advances forward on the left lane, eventually following the grey car out of the visible scene. The stationary red car, blue truck, and the white car's corner remain fixed on the right side relative to the viewer, while the heavy rainfall persists.
