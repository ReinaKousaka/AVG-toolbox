Subsequently, the couple in the mid-foreground continues walking away, moving deeper into the scene. A woman in a black puffer coat and white mask walks towards the viewer from the midground, eventually lifting her hand to her ear as if making a phone call. Meanwhile, another person in a light-colored coat emerges from the far left, moving rightwards across the foreground and partially obscuring the left pillar. Other pedestrians throughout the area continuously shift their positions.

The first frame depicts a busy indoor walkway, likely in a mall, with several people walking away from the viewer in the foreground. To the left, a large pillar displays an advertisement, while the wide path ahead is lined with shops and more advertising pillars, filled with numerous shoppers moving in various directions, with a red donation stand visible on the right midground.
end of description
As the frames progress, the foreground individuals walk further away from the viewer, revealing more of the patterned floor and people previously obscured behind them. Concurrently, new shoppers enter the scene from the background, and those initially in the midground continue approaching the first-frame viewpoint, passing the donation stand. The overall composition remains static, focusing on the continuous flow of people.

The first frame shows an indoor shopping mall corridor filled with people, many wearing winter coats and masks. In the immediate foreground, several individuals are walking away from the viewer, with others on the right moving past towards the background. To the viewer's left, a brightly lit store with a glass front displays numerous electronic accessories, while on the right, vertical illuminated pillars featuring Korean text and advertisements like "아피땅" and "허리" line the pathway, with more shops visible further in the distance.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward through the bustling mall. The individuals initially in the foreground gradually recede, while new people emerge from the right side and move towards the background. Consequently, the glass-fronted shop on the left and the illuminated advertising pillars on the right become closer and reveal more of their length and details.

In the first frame, the viewer is positioned in a wide indoor walkway, likely a shopping mall corridor. Several people walk ahead and away from the viewer, including an individual in a black puffer jacket with "DESCENTE" visible on their back in the center foreground, flanked by others in light-colored puffer jackets. To the far right, two individuals walk towards the viewer. On the left, a glass-fronted store with "SAMSUNG" branding displays numerous electronic accessories. On the right, multiple storefronts with illuminated signs, like "MIO" and "SEEK," stretch into the distance. The ceiling is white with recessed square lighting, and the tiled floor has a subtle pattern.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the foreground individuals walking away from the viewer gradually move further into the distance, and those walking towards the viewer pass by and eventually move behind the first-frame viewpoint. New sections of the stores on both the left and right, previously ahead of the first-frame viewpoint, become visible, revealing more product displays and shop entrances. The overall corridor extends further ahead, continuously revealing more distant shoppers and retail fronts.

The first frame depicts a brightly lit, spacious indoor shopping mall corridor extending into the distance, with a light-tiled floor and white ceiling. In the immediate foreground, several people are walking away from the viewer, including a person in a black puffer jacket with "DESCENTE" on the back and another in a light beige jacket to their left, while a person in a black jacket and blue jeans holding a bag walks towards the viewer on the far right. Storefronts with merchandise behind glass are visible on the left, and various shops, including one with wooden accents, line the right, with large illuminated pillars centrally located further down the corridor.
end of description
As the camera slowly moves forward, the individuals initially in the foreground gradually recede and move out of frame, revealing more of the floor and the shops ahead, which appear closer to the first-frame viewpoint. The person walking towards the viewer on the right side of the first frame approaches and eventually passes to the viewer's right. Consequently, previously obscured sections of the storefronts on both sides and new parts of the corridor further into the mall become visible, replacing the foreground figures.

The first frame depicts a bustling indoor corridor, possibly a mall, with numerous people walking in various directions, many wearing masks. In the foreground left, a person in a black jacket is partially visible, with two others in light grey jackets walking ahead and receding into the mid-ground. The corridor is lined with shops on the left and food stalls on the right, featuring two prominent cylindrical pillars with Korean advertisements, all beneath a white ceiling with patterned flooring.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward through the corridor. The three foreground individuals continue moving further away, while new pedestrians emerge from the distant background towards the viewer, notably a man on the far right becoming fully visible as he approaches.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows an indoor mall or hallway, brightly lit with recessed ceiling lights and a tiled floor. In the immediate foreground, the backs of several people are visible, including a person in a black 'Descente' jacket on the left and another in a light grey puffer jacket to their right, all moving away from the viewer. A busy crowd fills the midground, with many individuals wearing face masks and walking in various directions, some approaching the viewer. On the far left stands a large cylindrical pillar with a light blue and white advertisement, while another similar pillar with Korean text ("허리" visible) is positioned on the right. In the background, shops or stalls line both sides of the wide hallway.
end of description
As the frames progress, the immediate foreground figures, including the person in the black 'Descente' jacket, walk further away from the viewer, revealing more of the hallway. The individual in the white jacket and beige cap, initially in the mid-right walking towards the viewer, approaches and then passes to the viewer's right. Concurrently, other masked people in the midground move from deeper within the hallway towards and past the viewer, particularly on the right side. The overall crowd constantly shifts, with new individuals entering the scene from the deeper background and older figures moving out of frame, maintaining a consistent busy atmosphere in the indoor corridor.
