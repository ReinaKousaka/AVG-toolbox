The first frame depicts a rainy city street with a large billboard displaying soup and bread on a white building to the right, and a traffic light pole next to a wet crosswalk on the left. In the midground, pedestrians with umbrellas and cars are visible between a modern glass-fronted building and a large tree.
end of description
As frames progress, the initial pedestrians move across the crosswalk, with a new individual holding a black umbrella and carrying bags entering from the left and proceeding rightward. Concurrently, the large billboard on the right dynamically cycles its advertisement from soup to a burger, and then to a bright pink graphical display.

The first frame displays a wet city street, with a dark pole and traffic lights in the foreground left. A blonde woman, holding a grey umbrella and white shopping bags, walks from right-to-left across a zebra crossing in the mid-ground, while buildings, cars, and other pedestrians line the street in the background.
end of description. The blonde woman progresses leftward across the zebra crossing and eventually exits the frame to the far left. Subsequently, a dark-haired woman with a black umbrella enters from the right side, closer to the viewer than the background cars, walking leftward across the street. Concurrently, a pedestrian on the far left continues moving further left across the crossing.
