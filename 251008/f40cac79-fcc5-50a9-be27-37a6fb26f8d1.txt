The first frame depicts a crowded, neon-lit city street at night, with the viewer looking down the thoroughfare. To the viewer's immediate left, a narrow path runs alongside stalls; closest is a prominent black vertical sign with white East Asian characters and a wave design, above which is a wooden frame, and below, a display board with food images. Further left, yellow awnings and white hanging lanterns mark more shops, while a person in a grey jacket with a shoulder bag walks away. To the viewer's right, a dense crowd fills the street, with a person wearing a pumpkin mask and a woman holding a red bag visible in the foreground. Beyond them, large buildings are adorned with bright blue "ART" neon signs, a "NO EXIT" sign, and a yellow McDonald's logo, with a blue patterned wall below.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the dense crowd of people on the street steadily moves forward, away from the viewer's initial position, creating dynamic shifts in the scene. The person in the pumpkin mask and the woman with the red bag on the right slowly recede further into the street, revealing new individuals from the bustling crowd behind them. Concurrently, the person in the grey jacket on the left also progresses further down the path, and the viewer's perspective subtly advances, causing the black sign on the left to gradually move out of the leftmost edge of the frame.
