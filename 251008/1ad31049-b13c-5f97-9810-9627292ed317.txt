The first frame shows a snowy mountain landscape from a forward-moving perspective along train tracks. In the foreground and mid-ground, two parallel train tracks recede into the distance, curving slightly to the right, flanked by thick snow banks on both the left and right. Beyond the left snow bank, bare trees cling to a forested, snow-dusted mountainside, while a utility pole with overhead electrical lines stands prominently to the left of the tracks. The right side features a gentler snow slope and scattered trees, with a distant, larger snow-covered mountain range forming the backdrop under a partly cloudy sky. Text "Vmax: 60KM/h" is visible in the bottom-left corner.

As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the snow-covered landscape progresses, revealing more of the curving path ahead. A prominent snow and ice-covered rock face becomes increasingly visible on the right side, alongside a wooden fence structure appearing further up the slope. Gradually, a dark tunnel entrance, marked with a yellow sign, emerges ahead on the right, appearing from behind the snow and rock formations and growing larger as the perspective approaches.

The first frame presents a snow-covered train track receding into the distance, framed by snowy embankments, bare trees, and distant mountains under a partly cloudy sky. To the right, a tunnel entrance marked by a yellow sign and a wooden fence is visible in the mid-ground, while overhead electrical lines are supported by poles.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the tunnel entrance ahead and to the right grows larger, and the electrical pole on the left moves towards the frame's edge. Simultaneously, new, prominent ice formations become visible along the right-hand embankment as the scene progresses towards the tunnel.
