The viewer looks down a bustling city street at night, flanked by tall buildings with illuminated shop windows on both sides. Overhead, decorative white arching string lights span the street, extending into the distance where numerous pedestrians are visible, with a partial white vehicle in the bottom left foreground and a Salvatore Ferragamo store on the mid-right.

As the camera slowly advances forward, the partial white vehicle on the left gradually exits the frame to the viewer's left, revealing more of the street. Pedestrians across the street continuously move, with some passing by the original viewpoint and others advancing further into the distance. The shop facades and decorative overhead lights also slowly recede behind the viewer's new forward-moving position.

The first frame displays a lively night street scene adorned with numerous overhead illuminated archway decorations stretching into the distance. Buildings line both sides of the street, featuring storefronts and balconies, all brightly lit by warm streetlights and displaying visible shop interiors. The street is crowded with pedestrians, many wearing masks, including a group positioned to the viewer's immediate right foreground, a person in a blue jacket in the left foreground, and a person in a wheelchair further down the street, slightly left of center.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the initial group on the viewer's right foreground moves past and out of frame to the right. Concurrently, a couple previously in the mid-distance approaches from the right, moving into the central foreground and eventually passing the viewer on the left. The person in the wheelchair recedes deeper into the midground, while other pedestrians from the midground and background continuously move forward and past the viewer on both sides.

The first frame shows a narrow city street at night, looking forward down its length. Tall buildings line both sides, adorned with holiday lights and decorations; shops are visible at ground level. Numerous pedestrians walk along the street, with a blurred person in a black cap and jacket prominently in the lower left foreground, and another person on the right in a black jacket and tan pants, holding a phone to their ear. Far down the street, white arch-shaped lights span the road.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the blurred person in the lower left foreground exits the frame to the right. Concurrently, the person on the phone on the right also moves past the viewer's original position and out of frame to the right. The "Swatch" store sign, previously partially obscured on the left, becomes fully visible, moving towards the center of the left side. New pedestrians continuously appear on both sidewalks, emerging from behind the initial foreground figures and moving towards the viewer's original viewpoint, as the illuminated street arches in the distance grow steadily closer.
