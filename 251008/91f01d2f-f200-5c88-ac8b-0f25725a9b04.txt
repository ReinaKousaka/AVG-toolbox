The first frame shows a city street bordered by tall buildings. To the viewer's left, a modern building with a glass canopy leads to distant skyscrapers, one with a blue roof, while to the right, a row of planters with green foliage separates the street from multi-story buildings, including a prominent light-colored hotel with an arched entrance.

Across the subsequent frames, the scene's lighting subtly brightens, and the distinct shadows on the pavement gradually shift their positions from left to right. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the viewpoint and static elements remain constant.

The first frame presents a city street looking forward, bordered by tall buildings. On the right, multi-story structures house businesses like "EXECUTIVE HOTEL & SUITES" and "Bar" among trees and concrete planter boxes, while a covered walkway with a "TAQUERIA" sign extends along the left, also featuring trees.
end of description
Across the following frames, a person on a bicycle emerges from the mid-ground on the left side of the street and moves steadily further into the background, along the left sidewalk area.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a city street featuring a wide sidewalk on the left, partially covered by a glass canopy, and a paved road on the right. A planted median with green foliage separates the road from storefront buildings lining the right side, while tall city buildings rise in the background, including one with a green conical roof in the far left-background. A person on a bicycle is visible on the road in the mid-distance, slightly left of the center.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the cyclist, wearing an orange top and helmet, rides their black bicycle steadily closer to the viewer along the street. They move from the mid-distance to passing the viewer's immediate right, becoming larger and clearer as they approach the original first-frame viewpoint. No other significant objects or scenes are newly revealed.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a city street unfolds with a wide sidewalk on the left, featuring trees and a building with reflective windows and hanging banners, one reading "It's good to see you again!". To the right, separated by a green planter, is the street where a person on a bicycle, wearing a pink top and helmet, rides towards the right foreground. Tall city buildings dominate the background and midground on both sides of the street, with a faint red car visible in the distance on the street.
end of description
The cyclist in the foreground moves off-frame to the right. Concurrently, a pedestrian on the left sidewalk approaches the viewer from the distant background, eventually moving past the viewer's left. Subsequently, a person on an electric scooter enters the scene from the background on the street, steadily moving towards the viewer, from the center towards the right side of the frame. Simultaneously, multiple cars, including a dark sedan and a yellow taxi, appear in the background on the street, also moving closer to the viewer. The scooter rider then exits the frame to the right, while the cars continue to advance in the midground on the street.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a city street scene from the perspective of a sidewalk. To the left, a dark, reflective building with a 'LA TAQUERIA' sign extends into the midground, topped by a glass canopy reflecting a message "it's good to see you again!". Several thin trees with new green leaves line the left sidewalk, where people are visible walking further into the distance. A paved road runs down the center, separated from the right side by a planter box containing green foliage. On the far right, a person in a dark shirt and hat is partially visible in the foreground, moving out of view to the right. Parked along the right curb are a yellow car in front and a black car behind it, both to the right of the central road and next to the planter box. Behind these, numerous multi-story city buildings line the right side and recede into the background.

end of description

The person on the far right in the foreground exits the frame to the right. Concurrently, the black car previously parked on the right side of the road disappears from its position. The yellow car on the right then transforms into an orange-red car, now positioned slightly further down the street relative to its initial spot. A new person in a blue shirt subsequently enters the frame from the far right midground, walking leftwards on the right sidewalk.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents an urban street scene with a sidewalk occupying the lower half of the view. To the viewer's immediate left, a dark, reflective building facade runs parallel to the sidewalk, with a glass canopy extending above it. Further along the left sidewalk, two signs are visible, one for "LA TAQUERIA," and several pedestrians walk away from the viewer. On the sidewalk in the midground, a tree with young green leaves stands next to a bicycle rack. To the viewer's right, a paved street is separated from the sidewalk by a long planter box filled with greenery. In the background, tall buildings with numerous windows line both sides of the street, and distant pedestrians are also visible.
end of description
The viewer's perspective slowly advances forward through the urban environment. Consequently, the group of pedestrians walking along the left sidewalk, initially in the midground ahead of the first-frame viewpoint, steadily draws closer. Concurrently, a lone individual on the far right sidewalk, also ahead of the first-frame viewpoint but more distant, walks from the right side of the street towards the left. These movements emphasize the forward progression as no entirely new objects or scenes are revealed.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a sunlit urban street view. To the immediate left, a dark building facade features prominent signs including "you/we/are/open" and "LA TAQUERIA" beneath a glass canopy, bordering a paved sidewalk extending into the midground. Multiple trees with emerging green leaves are centrally positioned and to the right of the sidewalk, with bicycle racks situated near the viewer. To the right, a street separated by planter boxes leads to various storefronts and tall office buildings, which fill the midground and background, under a bright sky.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly advances forward, causing the signs on the left building to become slightly more pronounced and revealing more of the street ahead. People walking on the left sidewalk move further away from the viewer, receding into the midground, while another person on the far right of the street also walks deeper into the scene. The overall streetscape remains consistent, with no entirely new objects or scenes revealed beyond the slight perspective shift.
