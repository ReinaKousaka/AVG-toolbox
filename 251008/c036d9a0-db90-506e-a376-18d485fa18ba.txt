On the left, a large modern building with a light gray facade displays "AGRICULTURAL BANK OF CHINA" signage above dark double doors, with multiple green-tinted windows and columnar elements extending forward. Small trees in planters line the building's base. In the center, a paved sidewalk extends into the distance, occupied by several pedestrians walking away from the viewer, one pulling a rolling suitcase. To the right, a large tree with green leaves stands next to a utility pole, behind which a street is visible, along with a white delivery truck further down. Green bushes line the right edge of the sidewalk.

The camera moves forward along the sidewalk. The "AGRICULTURAL BANK OF CHINA" entrance recedes to the left, revealing more of the building's facade and additional small trees further down its length. The pedestrians continue walking further away from the viewer, and the delivery truck on the right is gradually passed, exposing more of the street and background trees in the distance.

The first frame depicts a wide sidewalk alongside a modern building on the left, which has large windows reflecting the sky and street, and a row of planter boxes with small trees. To the viewer's right, a large tree with green-yellow leaves dominates the midground, with a street and a partially visible white and red truck beyond a low green hedge on the far right. Several pedestrians are walking away from the viewer along the sidewalk, including one pulling a black rolling suitcase, towards more distant trees and buildings under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, the group of pedestrians ahead moves further away relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The large tree on the right gradually shifts further right and behind the viewer, while the modern building on the left extends further forward into the scene. The white and red truck, initially on the far right, advances and eventually moves out of the frame ahead of the viewer's original position.

The first frame shows a wide sidewalk running from the foreground towards the distance, bordered by a modern building with square planters holding small green trees on the left. On the right, a wide asphalt road is visible, partially obscured by a large tree branch in the upper right and a street light pole mid-frame. A group of pedestrians walks towards the viewer along the central sidewalk, with distant buildings and trees visible under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk; the building and planters on the left, and the large tree on the right, progressively shift behind the viewer. The group of pedestrians moves closer to the viewer and then walks past, while new sections of the sidewalk and road ahead are continually revealed, along with an orange cone appearing to the left of the viewer before also moving behind.
