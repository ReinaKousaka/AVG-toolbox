In the first frame, a woman in a red jacket and white mask, holding a pink umbrella, is positioned in the foreground to the viewer's right, facing slightly away. To the viewer's center-left, a man with a black umbrella walks away. An ornate rectangular sign with red text on a gold top stands immediately to the right of the woman. The wet pavement features yellow tactile strips. In the midground to the right, under a building awning, a man in a bright yellow jacket and hat holds an umbrella, near the entrance of a FamilyMart convenience store. Numerous other pedestrians with umbrellas are scattered further down the rainy street, with tall city buildings and a large billboard visible in the background.

From the perspective of the initial viewpoint, the woman in the red jacket (initially foreground right) quickly moves further to the viewer's right and exits the frame. Concurrently, the man with the black umbrella (initially center-left) walks further away and deeper into the scene from the first-frame viewpoint. A new person appears to the left of the man in the yellow jacket (midground right), with both remaining largely stationary relative to the storefront. As the viewpoint progresses forward, the tall sign on the immediate right shifts further to the right and out of sight, continually revealing more of the street ahead, including additional buildings and pedestrians who were initially deeper in the midground and background. The overall scene indicates a continuous forward movement along the rainy urban sidewalk.

In the first frame, a person holding a black umbrella walks away from the viewer on the left, partially obscuring a building wall. To the right, two individuals stand near a building entrance: one in a yellow jacket points towards the right, while the other in a dark jacket stands beside them. The wet sidewalk extends into the midground, where other pedestrians with umbrellas are visible further down the street, including one with a pink umbrella and another with a clear umbrella near the building entrance. Tall buildings with advertisements, including a large light blue billboard on the left and a "FamilyMart" sign on the right, form the background under an overcast sky.

Beginning from the second frame, the person in the yellow jacket on the right repeatedly lowers and raises their pointing arm. Subsequently, this individual and the person next to them gradually move to the viewer's left and deeper into the scene. A woman holding the pink umbrella, initially further back on the right, steps forward into the midground, becoming more central on the right by the last frame. Simultaneously, the person with the black umbrella in the foreground continues walking away from the viewer.

The first frame shows a rainy city street. In the immediate foreground on the left, part of a person holding a black umbrella is visible. To the right, a person holds a bright pink umbrella, standing near a glass-fronted building with an A-frame sign. A person holding a clear umbrella is seen exiting this building in the mid-ground to the right. The wet pavement, marked with yellow tactile strips, extends towards the mid-ground where numerous pedestrians with various umbrellas traverse a busy street containing vehicles and distant buildings.
end of description
Following this, the person with the clear umbrella, wearing a brown furry jacket, exits the building on the right and moves diagonally left across the wet pavement, receding into the mid-ground. Simultaneously, the person holding the pink umbrella on the far right shifts further to the viewer's right, eventually moving mostly out of view. Pedestrians across the street on the left continue their movement, with some becoming clearer as they advance towards the viewer's position.
