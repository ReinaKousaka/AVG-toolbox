The first frame depicts a wet urban street scene on an overcast day. In the foreground, a grey tiled sidewalk extends from the viewer towards the center, bordered on the left by a metal barrier and on the right by a strip of wet grass leading to storefronts. To the left, a multi-lane wet road shows a silver car moving away from the viewer, and further down, green traffic lights hang above the intersection. On the right, a row of businesses line the street, including a cafe with an outdoor air conditioning unit and a red awning covering a seating area further along. In the background, tall residential and commercial buildings rise, partially obscured by distant trees.

The green traffic lights on the far left begin to cycle, turning yellow then red. Concurrently, the silver car on the road continues to move away from the first-frame viewpoint, and other vehicles appear further down the street, also moving. Additionally, several pedestrians emerge on the distant sidewalk near the white covered stall, walking towards the viewer's left.
