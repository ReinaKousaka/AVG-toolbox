frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame depicts a paved road stretching into the distance from the viewer's immediate foreground. To the right, a light blue building with red shutters stands close to the road, followed by brown and white buildings further back, separated by a grassy incline and a fence. To the left, a low concrete wall borders the road, beyond which parked cars and green trees are visible, with distant green hills and more structures under a blue, cloudy sky.

No dynamic changes or newly revealed objects occur in the subsequent frames; the scene remains static relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

A paved road stretches into the distance from the bottom center of the frame. To its left, a low concrete barrier runs parallel to the road, behind which are green bushes, flat-topped trees, and parked cars, with distant forested hills visible on the horizon. To the right of the road, a black metal fence borders a grassy slope, leading up to a partially visible light blue house on the far right and a yellow building with red shutters further back. The sky above is bright blue with scattered white clouds.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the light blue house on the far right begins to recede from view, while the yellow building to its left becomes increasingly prominent. The black metal fence on the right passes by, gradually revealing more of the grassy slope and the facade of the yellow building. Concurrently, the concrete barrier and trees on the left also move past, showing more of the street and additional houses further down the road.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
A paved street extends into the distance under a bright blue, cloudy sky. To the left, a concrete barrier with a green hedge and small trees lines the road, while on the right, a large yellow timber-framed building with red-shuttered windows is prominent, behind a picket fence and a small tree in the foreground.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the yellow building on the right gradually recedes further into the distance relative to the initial viewpoint, fully revealing its roofline and a white-faced house with red shutters previously located further ahead. On the left, the hedge and trees also move further into the distance as new street sections and distant houses come into clearer view, previously unseen or obscured by the foreground. This forward progression continuously unveils previously distant elements from both sides of the street.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a paved road stretching into the distance under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. To the viewer's right, a row of multi-story houses with pitched roofs and prominent window shutters (red on the closest, dark on others) is visible, separated from the road by a black picket fence, grass, and a partially obscured black car. To the left, a concrete wall topped with dense green bushes runs parallel to the road, with small, manicured trees and a street light behind them, and distant houses nestled among green hills ahead.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the black car initially visible on the right is passed and disappears behind the viewer. A silver car, previously out of frame further down the road to the right, progressively enters the scene and becomes fully visible parked alongside the houses. The buildings on the right move closer to the viewer's perspective, revealing more of their facades further along the street. Simultaneously, the continuous line of green bushes and the concrete wall on the left extend further forward, indicating the path ahead of the initial viewpoint. The distant houses and hills in front remain visible but appear slightly closer.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a road extending into the distance under a bright, cloudy sky, bordered on the right by a row of light-colored houses with red and grey shutters, and on the left by green hedges, trees, and distant hills, with a light-colored vehicle visible far down the road.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the houses on the right grow larger, revealing balconies and red flowers in their window boxes, while the black fence alongside them also moves closer. On the left, a concrete barrier, a red fire hydrant attached to its far side, and a red bench emerge and approach, with additional parked cars becoming visible further back. A manhole cover also appears on the road directly in front of the viewer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a street scene under a blue sky with white clouds. To the immediate right, a pale yellow multi-story building with dark shutters and red window box flowers stands, preceded by a dark metal fence and green hedges. On the left, a concrete barrier, steps, and a red fire hydrant mark a parking area with several cars and abundant greenery, while a dark vehicle is parked further down the road ahead, with distant hills in the background.
end of description
The viewpoint advances down the street. The red fire hydrant and concrete steps on the left recede out of view, and the fence on the right changes from metal to wooden slats. As the yellow building on the right becomes less prominent, more of the pink building behind it is revealed, and the dark vehicle ahead gradually appears closer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a paved road extending forward, with a low concrete wall topped by green hedges on the left, and a wooden fence, followed by dense hedges and a large pink building, on the right. A dark van is parked further down the road, and additional houses with hills and a partly cloudy sky are visible in the distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the dark van ahead appears closer, and a lamppost and a blue parked car become visible on the left side, further down the road beyond the initial hedge. Simultaneously, the wooden fence on the right recedes, revealing more of the hedge and a metal fence behind it, while the pink building moves further back, exposing more of its facade and a yellow building beside it.
