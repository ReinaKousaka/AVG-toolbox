The first frame captures a bustling, wet street market scene under an overcast sky, with numerous pedestrians walking on a reflective ground, many holding umbrellas of various colors (blue, clear, black) and facing different directions. Market stalls laden with assorted goods line both sides of the narrow street, extending into the midground, while tall city buildings featuring illuminated signs and glass facades rise in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint steadily advances forward through the market. A man in a black shirt, holding a clear umbrella, gradually enters the foreground from the left and moves past the viewer, as other pedestrians continue their movement deeper into the scene. This forward motion continuously reveals new sections of market stalls displaying fresh items on both the left and right of the path.

The first frame captures a rainy, bustling street market filled with pedestrians under umbrellas, including a central man in a black shirt and a woman with a clear umbrella, walking past food stalls lining both sides towards distant city buildings with illuminated signs and a large ad screen.
end of description
Over the subsequent frames, the central man and woman with the clear umbrella steadily move forward and slightly to the left relative to the viewer, unveiling more of the bustling market street ahead of their initial position. Other pedestrians similarly advance away from the viewer, while a new man with a shopping bag appears to the far left. Concurrently, the distant advertising screen on the left building displays a changing image.

In the first frame, a wet, dark pavement reflecting overhead lights extends from the viewer into the midground, curving slightly to the left. People carrying umbrellas walk away from the viewer, including a person in a black shirt and shorts on the right holding a blue umbrella, and to their left, a person in a white top and green skirt holding a clear umbrella. On the far left, a person in a light top holds a dark umbrella, partially visible. Market stalls with light canopies line both sides of the street in the midground, displaying various items, with buildings and a large advertising screen on the left in the background, and more buildings and signage on the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the group of people walking away from the viewer continues to move further into the background. Concurrently, a man in a dark hoodie holding a clear umbrella and a woman in a dark dress with a clear umbrella emerge from the midground and walk towards the viewer, gradually moving closer and towards the left side of the frame. The person on the far left with the dark umbrella also moves slightly forward and more to the left relative to the viewer.

The first frame captures a bustling, rainy street market. In the immediate foreground, a woman with glasses and an umbrella is on the far left, while a man with long hair, also with an umbrella, approaches from the left-center. Directly ahead and slightly right, a group of three individuals carrying umbrellas walk away from the viewer. Market stalls with tarp roofs displaying various goods, including fruits on the right, line both sides of the wet pavement, receding into the midground. Tall buildings frame the background, with a large curved digital billboard on the left showing an advertisement of a person, and a prominent red "the SAEM" sign visible on the right-hand building.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewer moves forward along the street. The woman with glasses and the man with long hair walk past and exit the frame to the left, revealing more of the market stalls previously obscured. The group of three people ahead continues to move further away from the viewpoint. Simultaneously, the large digital billboard on the left building changes its display from an advertisement of a person to Korean text, "설마!".

In the first frame, two individuals are seen walking away from the viewer in the foreground, a woman in a white top and green skirt holding a clear umbrella, and a man in a dark top and shorts holding a blue umbrella. Market stalls with food items and goods line the wet pavement to the left and right, extending into the midground where more pedestrians and vendors are present. In the background, tall city buildings rise, with a large curved digital billboard on the left displaying the Korean text "설마!", and storefronts like "the SAEM" visible on the right.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the people in the foreground continuously move further away from the initial viewpoint. The most notable dynamic change occurs on the large digital billboard on the background left building. After briefly appearing blank, its display dynamically changes to show new Korean phrases sequentially: "바밤바!", followed by "비밀의 방!", and finally "한번 봐봐" in the last frames.

The first frame shows a bustling, wet street market scene, likely at dusk or on a cloudy day, with multiple market stalls flanking a paved walkway. To the far left, a food stall displays baked goods, and a person in a dark shirt is visible behind it, looking down at items. In the center foreground, two people walk away from the viewer, one holding a clear umbrella and the other a blue umbrella, on a reflective, wet surface. To the right, another market stall is visible, also with food items. In the midground and background, taller buildings line both sides of the street, with a large, curved digital billboard displaying Korean text prominently on a building to the left. The overall scene is open-air, with a cloudy sky above.
end of description
The two central pedestrians holding umbrellas move further down the street, away from the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, more pedestrians, also carrying umbrellas, become increasingly visible behind them, continuing to walk away from the viewer along the same path. No new fixed objects or scenes are revealed; rather, the existing people move further into the distance.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a rainy urban street scene with wet, reflective pavement in the foreground. To the left, a street vendor stall with a clear plastic tarp roof exhibits various goods, and a person in a black cap is seen examining items. In the center, several pedestrians walk away from the viewer, many holding open umbrellas, including one clear and one blue. Along the right, storefronts like "ALL MARK STORY" are visible, while a large, curved digital billboard on a building to the far left background displays Korean text.
end of description
The main dynamic change is observed on the large digital billboard located to the left of the first-frame viewpoint. It cycles from displaying Korean text to "PARIS BAGUETTE," then shows "KFC" above "PARIS BAGUETTE," before presenting only the "KFC" logo. Subsequently, "BASKIN ROBBINS" appears above "KFC," and finally, only the "BASKIN ROBBINS" logo is shown. Meanwhile, the pedestrians in the middle ground continue to walk further away, and the umbrellas they carry shift slightly in position.
