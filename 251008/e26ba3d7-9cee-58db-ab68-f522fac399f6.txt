In the first frame, a paved road extends from the viewer into the midground, curving slightly leftward. To the immediate right, a dark brown multi-story building with turquoise window shutters and a stone retaining wall with green hedges are prominent, with stone steps leading up from the far right. Further down the road on the left, several traditional houses are visible, beyond which a massive, partially snow-capped mountain range dominates the distant left background under an overcast sky.

As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the large building on the right recedes and reveals a lower wooden building with a balcony to its right. The houses on the left and center grow closer, while a convex traffic mirror appears on the far left, becoming more prominent. The distant snow-capped mountain shifts slightly leftward relative to the advancing viewpoint.

The first frame displays an asphalt road curving gently to the right in the foreground, leading towards several traditional houses nestled in the mid-ground. To the left, a white and dark brown house is prominent, with a spherical convex mirror on a pole to its far left, and majestic snow-capped mountains dominating the distant background under an overcast sky. On the right, a stone retaining wall lines the road, topped with green foliage and a glimpse of a building further back and higher up.

As the viewpoint moves forward, the spherical mirror on the far left of the initial frame quickly disappears from view to the left. The retaining wall and the partial building on the right gradually recede and move out of frame to the right, revealing a chain-link fence and green hillside above the wall. Concurrently, the houses and parked cars in the mid-ground of the first frame draw closer, revealing more of their architectural details.
