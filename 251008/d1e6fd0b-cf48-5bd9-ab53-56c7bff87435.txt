The first frame displays a rain-slicked city street on an overcast day. In the foreground, a dark asphalt road stretches into the distance, marked by a yellow line on the left and a large white '30' painted on the left side. The front right corner of a dark grey car is partially visible on the far right. To the left of the road, a sidewalk features green bushes and a tall lamp post, with multi-story buildings behind them housing shops displaying Korean signs and a blue awning. Several black cars are parked along the left side of the street, while further down the street in the midground, red traffic lights are visible at an intersection. The right side of the scene includes more buildings, trees, a blue parking sign, and a yellow sign higher up.

The following frames consistently show a steady rainfall across the entire visible scene. The wet road surface, from the foreground into the midground, continually glistens with new ripples and reflections from the falling rain. No new objects are revealed, and all static elements and their spatial positions remain unchanged from the initial viewpoint. The red traffic lights in the distance remain illuminated throughout.

The first frame displays a wet asphalt road with yellow and white markings in the foreground, extending into a city street lined with multi-story buildings and parked vehicles on both sides. To the left, shopfronts with awnings and signs are visible, while the right features a sidewalk with a parked scooter, street signs, a trash can, and a tree, with red traffic lights appearing further down the street.

Subsequent frames show continuous rainfall, dynamically evidenced by the appearance and disappearance of small splashes and ripples across the wet road surface, most prominently in the foreground near the white crosswalk line. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the primary change is the consistent visual depiction of rain falling on the street.

The first frame presents a wide-angle view of a wet asphalt street under an overcast sky, stretching into the distance. In the foreground, white crosswalk lines and a yellow curb line are visible on the road. To the left, a building with Korean signs and a blue awning houses potted plants, with a black car parked further down the street. On the right, a sidewalk features a parked white scooter, a blue parking sign, a red-topped trash can, a fence, and an information board, while red traffic lights are visible in the far distance.

Subsequent frames reveal a continuous, light rainfall, subtly indicated by transient ripples and faint disturbances visible on the wet asphalt surface in the mid-ground. The overall scene remains static, with no new objects emerging or significant vehicular or pedestrian movement occurring relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
