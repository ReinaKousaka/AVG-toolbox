A wide road with white dashed lines occupies the lower middle and right, flanked by a metal guardrail on the far right. To the left, a village features brown multi-story buildings, including one with green shutters on the far left and a larger one displaying flags centrally. A black car is visible on the road in front of this central building, moving rightward. Behind the village, a sunlight-drenched, tree-covered mountain slope rises on the left, leading to jagged peaks further right under a partly cloudy blue sky.

end of description

The black car proceeds to move further right along the road, eventually exiting the frame. Concurrently, a vertical metal pole appears on the far right and moves leftward across the frame as the viewpoint advances. As the perspective shifts, a turquoise and a blue car, previously partially obscured, become fully visible parked in front of the central brown building. The flags on this building are revealed to be vertical banners, while the overall scene progressively shifts left relative to the advancing viewer.

A two-lane road, marked with solid and dashed white lines, extends from the lower right towards the center-left, with a metal guardrail bordering its right edge. On the far left, a dark blue SUV is partially visible behind a white and grey banner, parked next to a blue sports car, both near a large, dark-wood building with a prominent balcony. Further right in the midground, a white house with green shutters is visible, all set against a backdrop of majestic, tree-covered mountains under a partly cloudy blue sky, with a valley receding into the distance on the far right.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily advances forward along the road, causing the dark SUV and blue sports car to move out of frame to the left, now behind the viewer relative to their initial positions. As the scene unfolds, the large dark-wood building on the left moves progressively out of frame, revealing more of the grassy area and a small bare tree previously obscured or beyond the first frame's leftmost extent. Further along, a reddish-roofed building and a blue-sided structure are revealed, positioned behind and to the left of the white house. Finally, a small wooden shed appears slightly further along the road, situated to the left and behind the white house relative to the first frame's viewpoint.

In the first frame, a two-lane road with white markings occupies the foreground, extending diagonally from the lower left towards the mid-right. A metal barrier lines the right edge of the road, while lush green grass stretches from the road to the left, where a white house with a dark roof and green shutters stands prominently. To the left of the white house is an older building with a red roof and a small wooden shed, all set against a backdrop of a partially sunlit, tree-covered mountain on the left. In the distant midground, more mountains frame a valley on the right, under a blue sky with scattered clouds, and a blue and white road sign is visible far down the road on the right.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward, causing the white house and adjacent structures to progressively shift left and exit the frame. A vertical grey pole enters from the right side, eventually obscuring much of the midground. As the scene progresses, more distant village houses become visible further down the valley to the left of the road, and a red circular '60' speed limit sign appears on the right side of the road, further away from the viewer than the initial blue sign.
