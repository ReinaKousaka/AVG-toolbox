frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The initial frame displays a city street with a wide asphalt road in the foreground, marked by white and red pedestrian crossings, and a central lamppost featuring green traffic lights and two flags. To the left, a street with moving cars is flanked by buildings, including a distant modern skyscraper, while a park area with pedestrians and parked taxis occupies the midground to the right.
end of description
The view gradually pans right, causing the central lamppost to shift left and progressively revealing more of the park, along with a prominent, light-colored historical building (the Palace of Culture and Science) emerging in the far right background behind the trees. From frame 5, a textual overlay "PALACE OF CULTURE AND SCIENCE" appears in the lower mid-frame, further identifying the newly visible structure as the scene continues its rightward pan.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
In the first frame, a wide street scene unfolds under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The grand Palace of Culture and Science, a tall, ornate building topped with a spire, dominates the background, slightly right of center. In the immediate foreground, a crosswalk with white stripes spans the road, featuring a bicycle symbol on its left side. To the far left, a group of pedestrians stands near the crosswalk, backed by lush green trees, while a traffic light with a green signal is also visible. Several cars, including two white taxis, are stopped or parked near the crosswalk in the center-left, with another unlit traffic light pole beside them. A low, stone-filled gabion wall lines the right side of the road, behind which smaller trees and more greenery are visible, extending towards the mid-ground.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly shifts forward and to the right, progressively revealing more of the road ahead and the structures along its right side. A silver car previously near the right edge of the frame begins to move forward along the road. Concurrently, a tall, modern building with many windows emerges more prominently into view on the far right, further along the road from the initial perspective. Additionally, a central traffic light, initially dark, illuminates green in the later frames.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a sunny street scene with a multi-lane road extending into the distance. In the foreground, a silver sedan is in the middle lane, and a grey SUV is in the right lane, both moving away from the viewer. To the left, a stone gabion wall runs alongside the road, backed by trees, with the tall Palace of Culture and Science building prominently visible in the mid-left background. On the right, a modern skyscraper rises high, next to a red bike lane with parked bicycles and a sidewalk with pedestrians, while traffic signs and a bus are further along the street. The text "PALACE OF CULTURE AND SCIENCE" is overlaid at the bottom center.
end of description
As the video progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, indicating a vehicle's motion. The stone gabion wall and foreground trees on the left recede and move out of view, revealing more of the Palace of Culture and Science to the left. Simultaneously, the cars ahead move further away, and the bike lane, parked bicycles, and pedestrians on the right also pass by, exiting the frame from the right side as the camera advances.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, the viewer is on a multi-lane asphalt road with white lane markings. To the left, a low stone wall borders a green area with trees, behind which stands a tall, ornate skyscraper. Down the road in the center, two cars are visible. On the far right, a red bike lane runs parallel to the main road, containing a silver car, with a tall modern building complex towering beside the street where pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk. The sky above is blue with scattered white clouds.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the road. The silver car on the right recedes, revealing a dark grey SUV previously behind it and a yellow bollard further along the right sidewalk relative to the initial viewpoint. A circular manhole cover appears centrally in the foreground of the viewer's lane, becoming fully visible as the viewer's position advances past its initial, un-revealed location. All vehicles ahead continue moving further away from the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a city street scene from a forward-facing perspective, featuring a multi-lane road with a white car visible ahead in the middle lane. To the left, a stone wall, green trees, and a grand ornate building stand prominently, contrasting with modern high-rises, a red bike lane, sidewalk with pedestrians, a bus, and parked cars to the right, all beneath a blue sky with scattered clouds.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer slowly advances forward along the road. The white car ahead travels closer to the viewer, while the stationary bus and parked cars on the right maintain their relative positions beside the advancing viewpoint.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The viewer is on a multi-lane road under a blue sky with scattered clouds. To the left, a tall, ornate light-colored skyscraper stands above a stone wall and park with trees, with a smaller building partially visible behind them. To the right, modern glass skyscrapers tower over a red bus lane and a yellow and green city bus parked at a bus stop, while a white car is visible further down the road ahead.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the white car ahead appears to get slightly closer. Concurrently, a large brown and orange tour bus emerges from behind the stone wall to the viewer's left, gradually becoming more fully visible as it moves across the frame. All surrounding objects, including the distant skyscrapers and the stationary bus, appear closer in subsequent frames.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a multi-lane road extending into the distance under a partly cloudy sky. To the left, a tall, ornate stone building dominates, flanked by trees and a low stone wall, while to the right, modern glass high-rises overlook a parked yellow and red bus, a white van, and a red car. A white car is visible straight ahead on the road.
end of description.
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves continuously forward, causing the white car ahead to incrementally approach and the buildings on both sides to appear closer and wider in the field of view. Concurrently, the trees and the stone wall on the left slowly move past the viewer's position.
