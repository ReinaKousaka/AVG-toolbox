A large silver chandelier with numerous white-shaded lights hangs centrally from a white ceiling. Below it, towards the bottom center, is a large green plant in a textured pot. To the left, a framed portrait of a young boy in a white shirt and blue shorts is visible on the blue and white patterned wallpaper. To the right, red drapes frame a window through which outdoor greenery is visible. A recessed light and a speaker are also visible on the white ceiling.

The camera executes a slow pan to the right and a subtle zoom. The central chandelier appears slightly larger and shifts leftward in the frame. Concurrently, the framed boy's portrait on the left moves further out of view to the left. The window on the right expands its visible area, revealing more of the bright outdoor foliage and sunlight, causing the reddish curtains to shift further leftward within the frame.
