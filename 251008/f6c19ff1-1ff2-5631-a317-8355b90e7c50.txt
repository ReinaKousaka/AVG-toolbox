The first frame shows a first-person view from a train moving along two parallel tracks that recede into the distance. To the immediate right, a long reddish-brown freight train moves alongside on an adjacent track. A dense, green, tree-covered hillside rises to the left. Overhead, a network of power lines and gantries spans the sky, which transitions from pale blue to orange in the distance, where a small building is faintly visible to the right of the tracks. Text overlays display "Location: Veliki Borak" and "Vmax = 90 km/h" in the bottom left, and "DULEVOZ" in the bottom right.

Subsequently, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks. The freight train on the right continues passing, revealing more of its cars, while the dense hillside on the left moves past the viewer's side. Overhead electrical lines and support structures appear to shift from above and pass behind, with new ones continuously appearing ahead. As the scene progresses, a third track becomes visible to the right of the existing two, leading towards the approaching building previously seen in the far distance. Additionally, a 'Position: 112 m' text overlay is revealed in the bottom left corner in the final frame.

The first frame shows a train's forward view along tracks, with a vegetated hillside on the left and a brown freight car beside a red-roofed building to the front-right, beneath overhead power lines.
end of description
As the train moves forward, the freight car recedes and disappears to the front-right, fully revealing the building and subsequently a white truck parked near it. The hillside on the left dynamically changes from dense vegetation to an exposed rocky cliff face as the viewer advances. The tracks ahead continue to curve to the front-right, with overhead structures passing above.
