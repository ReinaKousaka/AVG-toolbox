The first frame captures a narrow urban alley at dusk, flanked by buildings on both sides. To the viewer's left, a building shows utility boxes and a parked bicycle, while to the right, a white signboard and potted plants are visible. A person walks towards the viewer in the street's mid-distance, slightly right of center. end of description. The person continues walking closer, passing the viewer and moving out of frame to the viewer's immediate left. Subsequently, the street appears empty, with all other objects remaining static in their initial positions.

The first frame shows a narrow urban street extending away from the viewer under an overcast sky, lined with multi-story buildings on both sides. To the viewer's left, a bicycle is parked in the foreground, followed by a green bin, a blue tarp-covered object, and a building facade with a red lantern and another bicycle. On the right, a tiled sidewalk features potted plants and a white A-frame sign in the foreground, adjacent to a building with a large glass storefront and a bicycle parked nearer to it. Overhead, numerous power lines crisscross the street as buildings recede into the distance.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the street, progressively revealing more of the path ahead. Objects initially in the midground, like the red lantern on the left and the A-frame sign on the right, appear closer and larger relative to the viewer's initial position. Concurrently, new bicycles become visible parked further along both sides of the street, and the overall lighting subtly brightens throughout the scene.

A narrow Japanese alley stretches into the distance, bordered by multi-story buildings; a red lantern and bicycle are prominently visible on the left, while a white sign and another bicycle stand on the right, with dense utility wires overhead.
end of description
As the camera moves forward into the alley, objects on the immediate left and right gradually exit the frame laterally. The red lantern on the left is replaced by a fabric noren, and the street ahead continuously reveals more of the receding buildings and path.
