The first frame depicts a wet park pathway extending into the distance, marked by a yellow tactile line on the right, and a dark bench on the left foreground. Green bushes border both sides, with a brick wall and fences to the right, and trees to the left; heavy rain is falling, making a distant figure barely visible along the path. end of description. Across the subsequent frames, the heavy rain persists, generating visible splashes and ripples on the wet ground, while the distant figure slowly moves further away along the pathway. The scene otherwise remains unchanged.

In the first frame, a wet park pathway stretches from the viewer into the misty distance. To the immediate left, a dark park bench with wooden slats and circular spoked ends rests beside a strip of green bushes. Further left, a line of trees with green foliage borders the pathway, while to the right, a low brick wall topped with green fencing and trimmed bushes runs parallel to a yellow tactile strip on the pathway. In the far distance, two figures walk away from the viewer on the path, and fine raindrops are visible throughout the scene.
end of description
Throughout the sequence, the distant figures on the path gradually move further away from the viewer until they are no longer visible. Subsequently, a small white object appears on the paved path to the left of the yellow line in the mid-ground, slowly moving further down the path before disappearing. Finally, a second park bench, identical to the one in the foreground, is revealed much further down the path on the left, beyond the previous position of the figures, remaining stationary. Rain consistently falls across the scene, creating visible splashes on the wet surfaces.
