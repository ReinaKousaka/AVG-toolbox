The first frame captures a rainy urban street scene. In the foreground, dark tree trunks and foliage are on the left, while a gray car's rear and a black metal barrier are on the right. A white SUV with headlights on drives rightward on the wet midground road, and a person with a yellow umbrella walks on the distant sidewalk beyond. The background consists of multi-story buildings housing shops and apartments, topped by a distant tower, all under an overcast, rainy sky.
end of description
The white SUV progresses across the midground to the right. A black sedan then appears on the road behind the white SUV, to its left, and also moves rightward. An umbrella briefly enters the top-center of the frame, suggesting a change in the viewer's immediate overhead cover. Both vehicles continue their rightward movement, with the white SUV exiting the frame to the far right as the black sedan takes its place in the midground, and the person with the yellow umbrella continues walking on the distant sidewalk.
