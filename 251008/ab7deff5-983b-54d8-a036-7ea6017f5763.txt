The first frame captures a courtyard scene with a blue signpost featuring "400 SAN FELIPE DEL NORTE" and "BILLY THE KID" in the immediate foreground-left, beside a black trash can. To the left, an adobe building with a porch stretches into the mid-ground, facing a brick pathway that curves towards the center-right, bordered by another adobe structure. Colorful papel picado flags are strung overhead across the mid-ground, leading to more distant buildings and trees under a twilight sky.

As the viewpoint gradually recedes, the blue signpost and trash can move out of frame to the viewer's left, revealing more of the brick pathway in the immediate foreground. This smooth backward motion progressively widens the view of the central courtyard and its decorative flags, with all other architectural elements maintaining their relative positions further back in the scene.

In the first frame, a brick-paved courtyard extends from the viewer into the midground. To the left, a light-colored building with a covered porch and white railing stretches into the distance, featuring a large planter in the foreground and a green-framed window further back. To the right, a stucco wall covered in vines and with stacked bricks at its base recedes, revealing a blue-framed door in the midground. Colorful strings of papel picado banners and string lights hang overhead across the frame, while a central garden bed separates a curving path leading to more brightly colored buildings in the background under a dusky sky.

The camera slowly pans right and slightly zooms out, causing the left side of the scene (the building and planter) to shift slightly further left relative to the initial viewpoint. This subtle movement progressively reveals more of the stucco wall and vines on the far right of the frame, alongside the blue-framed door. The colorful banners overhead also shift gently, and the overall perspective subtly widens, slightly expanding the view of the background buildings and trees.

The first frame presents a narrow outdoor path or courtyard bordered by adobe-style buildings under a pale sky. In the foreground, a paved path extends forward with a reddish narrower path veering left. To the left, a light-colored building features a patio with a white railing and a window; further back are more buildings and trees with autumnal foliage. Centered is a large bushy plant in a raised bed, behind which colorful papel picado banners are strung across the scene. To the right, a vine-covered adobe wall features a dark blue gate within a recessed blue-framed doorway.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly pulls back and widens, causing the buildings and foreground paths to appear slightly further from the viewer. This backward movement reveals more of the colorful papel picado banners, which become more prominent and span a greater portion of the upper midground relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
