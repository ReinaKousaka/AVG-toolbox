frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame shows a street scene flanked by buildings under a blue sky with scattered clouds. A white SUV is parked on the left in front of a reddish-brown building with green shutters, while a red van with an open tailgate is parked on the right in front of a light grey building with balconies, identifiable by a red 'Fl√ºgerli' sign. The asphalt road stretches into the midground, lined by more buildings, towards distant mountains.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the parked white SUV on the left and the red van on the right recede and move out of view, revealing a Swiss flag on the left building and a new white car parked further ahead on the right. The buildings flanking the road appear closer and shift towards the edges, with an "EISENHANDLUNG" sign becoming prominent on the left building, as the distant mountains expand into view in the background.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a paved road stretching directly away from the viewer towards distant mountains under a blue sky with scattered clouds. To the viewer's left, a light yellow building with balconies is partially visible near the foreground, followed by a grey building further down the road, with mountains behind them. To the viewer's right, a stone wall lines the road, behind which a yellow building with red shutters and parked cars are visible, also with distant mountains in the background. A street light pole stands centrally in the midground above the road.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the road. Buildings on both sides, initially in the midground, approach the viewer and slowly begin to exit the frame at the sides. The light yellow building on the left and the yellow building with red shutters on the right become larger, revealing more details as they pass. A grey building further down on the left, initially partially obscured, fully enters view, revealing parked cars in front of it. On the right, a blue tractor and additional cars become visible behind the stone wall as the viewer advances, while the street light pole moves toward the left side of the frame.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a road stretching forward through a town, flanked by buildings. To the left, a prominent light grey multi-story building with a yellow 'MK' sign stands, with a silver SUV parked in front and distant mountains behind it. To the right, a yellow building with red accents and a blue tractor are visible, separated by a grey stone wall in the foreground.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the blue tractor on the right recedes and disappears, revealing a black car with a trailer and a white car parked further behind it, to the right of the initial tractor position. A light blue car appears from the distant road ahead and drives towards the viewer, crossing newly visible yellow pedestrian stripes directly in front of the viewer. This light blue car then passes to the left of the viewer, as the surrounding buildings become larger and more detailed from the advancing viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a road with yellow crosswalk stripes directly in front of the viewer, flanked by multi-story buildings on both sides, with a black SUV driving away in the mid-ground. Mountains rise in the distant background under a blue, partly cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, the yellow stripes recede behind the first-frame position. The black SUV moves further ahead relative to the initial viewpoint, eventually exiting the scene. Buildings on both sides, including garage doors and a white van on the right, and a white car on the left, pass by the original viewpoint, continuously revealing more of the road and distant scenery.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a street looking forward, flanked by buildings; a light grey building with a silver car is on the left, and a beige building with a white van is on the right. The road extends into the distance towards mountains under a blue sky.
end of description
Chronologically, the white van on the right backs out and drives away from the viewer. Simultaneously, the silver car on the left is replaced by a silver station wagon parked in the same spot. The viewpoint then subtly shifts forward, revealing a brown building with an 'Avia' sign more clearly visible further down the street on the left and a new dark SUV parked on the right, further down the street.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a paved road with a white dashed line down its center extends from the viewer into the distance, under a blue sky with scattered clouds. To the viewer's immediate left, a tall street lamp post stands in the foreground, followed by a gas station with a red canopy and fuel pumps, and a light brown building behind it displaying an "AVIA" sign. Further left and in the background, green mountains rise. To the right, a multi-story, light-colored building with red-framed windows is visible, with a dark grey car parked on the yellow-lined pavement in front of it. Further along the road to the right, more buildings and parked cars can be seen, leading to distant mountains in the background.

end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The street lamp on the far left of the first frame quickly moves out of view to the left. The gas station and the brown Avia building, initially to the mid-left, become larger and clearer as the viewer approaches, revealing the fuel prices on the Avia sign. Concurrently, the large building on the right of the first frame moves closer, and its right edge disappears off-screen, revealing more of the street and new parked cars, including a red car and a black SUV, further down the right side of the road.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A paved road with white and yellow markings extends centrally into the distance, flanked by a brown/pink multi-story building on the immediate left and a light green multi-story building on the immediate right, which has a red car and black SUV parked in front. Distant green mountains frame a valley ahead under a blue sky with scattered white clouds, with two streetlights visible over the road.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the road, causing the initial brown building on the left and the green building on the right to recede into the background, along with the parked red car and black SUV. A white van is revealed on the right, moving further away in a parking spot previously occupied by the red car. Further ahead, a pedestrian crossing sign and yellow road markings become visible in the central-left area. Subsequently, a red building with a Swiss flag appears further to the right of the original green building. The mountains in the background gradually become more prominent and closer on both sides of the valley.
