The first frame displays a wet city street on an overcast, rainy day. In the foreground, a wet asphalt road with white dashed lines and a red bicycle lane to the right extends towards the viewer. In the midground, a median strip with green foliage and yellow/black striped barriers separates traffic lanes, while a traffic light pole with red lights and pedestrian signals stands on the right, near a person holding an umbrella on the sidewalk. Tall apartment buildings and abundant green trees line both sides of the road in the background, with a church steeple visible on the distant left.

A white sedan then appears from the bottom left, moving across the foreground from left to right. After it clears the view, another white sedan enters from the bottom left and proceeds to move right across the foreground.
