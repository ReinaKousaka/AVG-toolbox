The first frame presents an uphill road under a blue, cloudy sky, flanked by buildings. To the left, a multi-story wooden structure with balconies features a lower-level parking entrance where a white car is visible and a person stands near a dark car; on the right, several dark cars are parked in front of another building, with a taller hotel and distant mountains in the background.

As the sequence progresses, the viewer moves forward along the road; the initial dark car and person on the far left gradually disappear from view. The blue parking sign and the building's lower section on the left also recede as more of the stone retaining wall comes into prominence. Further down the road, a white truck becomes visible on the right, while all static objects ahead, including the parked cars on the right and the "HOTEL BELVEDERE," appear closer.
