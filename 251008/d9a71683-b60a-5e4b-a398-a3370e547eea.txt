A wet asphalt road, marked with a solid white line on the right and a broken white line on the left, curves gently away from the viewer towards the upper left, flanked by grassy embankments. Dense green trees, primarily deciduous with some evergreens, line both sides of the road, extending upwards and into the distant, misty mountains under an overcast sky. Several white road marker posts are visible along the left curve, receding into the background, and one is prominent on the right side in the mid-ground.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, raindrops become visible and stream across the viewer's perspective, especially on the upper left, indicating increasing precipitation. The road marker posts on both sides appear to approach and then recede past the viewer's position. The broken white line on the road on the right side progressively lengthens from the foreground, emphasizing forward motion through the tree-lined, wet landscape.
