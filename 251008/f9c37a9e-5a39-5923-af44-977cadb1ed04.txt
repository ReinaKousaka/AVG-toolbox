The first frame displays an aerial view of a vibrant green forested coastline positioned at the top left, transitioning into a light-colored rocky beach where white waves vigorously break against clear turquoise ocean water. Several dark rocks are visible in the ocean, both close to the shore and scattered further out to the right and top right.

The camera subtly shifts throughout the frames, progressively revealing more of the scene. The dense green forest on the left expands further down the hillside, extending its visible area towards the bottom left from its original position. Concurrently, the rocky beach and the breaking waves below it stretch further into the bottom-left view, while the turquoise ocean water on the right visibly widens, making more scattered dark rock formations, particularly those towards the upper right, more distinct. White waves continually crash onto and recede from the shore.

An aerial view presents a dense green forest covering the landmass on the left, meeting a light-colored, rocky and pebbled coastline that curves towards the bottom-center. To the right and foreground, a vast turquoise ocean features white crashing waves along the shore and numerous dark rocks scattered within its waters, with a larger rocky outcrop visible in the top-right.
end of description
The scene gradually widens, zooming out and slightly panning right, revealing more of the expansive turquoise ocean to the right and a more extended distant coastline across the top-right horizon, while the waves continue their rhythmic breaking along the shore.

An aerial view presents a vibrant tropical coastline. To the left, a dense green forest covers a sloped landmass, meeting a rocky shoreline with waves breaking against it. To the right, clear turquoise ocean water extends into a curving bay, dotted with dark rock formations and showing a distant forested coastline with some structures under a partly cloudy blue sky in the upper right.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly pans to the right, gradually revealing more expansive blue sky and the distant horizon *above* and *to the right* of the initial frame. The curving coastline of the bay becomes more prominent, extending further *to the right* of its initial position, while the left edge of the dense forest *moves further to the left* and slightly out of view. The waves crashing against the rocks in the ocean continually change, adding dynamic movement within the established scene.
