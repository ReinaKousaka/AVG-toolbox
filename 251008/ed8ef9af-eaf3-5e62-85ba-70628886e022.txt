A dirt road, scattered with rocks and loose earth, extends from the immediate foreground towards the middle distance, curving slightly uphill to the right. To the left, a steep, grassy slope descends into a dense forest of evergreen trees, which continues into the distant background. To the right, another steep, grassy embankment rises, featuring larger evergreen trees and some visible rocks; a single prominent tree stands on this right slope in the midground. Above, a cloudy sky partially obscures the blue sky.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the dirt road. Consequently, the rocky terrain in the foreground continuously shifts away from the viewer's original position, while new sections of the road and surrounding landscape are revealed ahead. The dense forest on the left and the grassy embankment with trees on the right appear to pan outwards from the center as the viewpoint advances, exposing previously unseen stretches of both slopes ahead.
