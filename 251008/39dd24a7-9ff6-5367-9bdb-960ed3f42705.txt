The first frame presents a wet city street on an overcast, snowy day, with a brown brick building featuring white fire escapes running along the left side. A white Mini Cooper and a black car are parked adjacent to storefronts, including "Grace Food & Deli," along this building. In the mid-ground, a white van with a green logo is situated on the road, while a black SUV is partially visible on the far right, closer to the viewer, with white crosswalk lines in the foreground.
end of description
In the following frames, the white van in the mid-ground steadily moves forward, driving away from the viewer down the wet street. Concurrently, the black SUV on the right also progresses forward and away, gradually exiting the right side of the frame. As these vehicles advance, more of the street and additional snow-dusted cars and buildings in the distance become visible directly ahead of the viewer. No new objects are revealed behind, to the immediate left, or right of the initial viewpoint.
