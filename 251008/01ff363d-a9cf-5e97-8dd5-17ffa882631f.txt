In the first frame, a wide street with multiple lanes occupies the midground and foreground. To the left, a large white building with a brown gabled roof and numerous windows stands prominent, its ground floor featuring 'MATRATZEN CONCORD' signs and 'SALE' posters in large storefront windows. A blue car is parked on a red-marked bike lane in front of this building, while a white SUV is visible further down the road, driving away from the viewer. On the far right, a grey pole with a sign is in the foreground, and a sidewalk with a person's legs visible extends into the background, where a white bus is driving away.
end of description
The blue car remains stationary on the left side of the road throughout the sequence. The white SUV, initially in the midground, consistently moves away from the viewer along the road, gradually shifting towards the right side of the frame. Concurrently, the white bus in the far background also continues driving away from the viewer. By the final frame, the white SUV has almost exited the frame to the right, indicating continuous movement away from the first-frame viewpoint.
