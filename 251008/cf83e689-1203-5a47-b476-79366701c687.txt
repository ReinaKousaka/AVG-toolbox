The first frame presents a cityscape dominated by a wide river in the foreground, reflecting the surrounding environment under a bright sky. A prominent rust-colored bridge spans the midground, connecting numerous modern skyscrapers lining the left bank with a distinctive cylindrical building and other structures on the right. Further into the background, additional buildings and a construction site with a crane are visible.
