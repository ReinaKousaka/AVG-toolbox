The first frame displays a rustic stone wall as the background, made of light-colored, uneven blocks. In the midground, a black metal coat rack with five hooks is visible, holding several coats and jackets in various shades of beige, tan, and olive green. To the far left, a light-colored curtain hangs partially, while a straw hat with a black band is partly visible in the lower right, below the coat rack. A small, dark, recessed window with a wooden grate is situated in the stone wall to the right.

The view slowly pans upwards, revealing a wooden shelf mounted directly above the coat rack. As the camera continues to ascend, more objects appear on this newly revealed shelf. First, two ornate, dark-colored walking sticks or staffs are seen resting horizontally on the lower part of the shelf, and then a long, curved broom with a brush-like end emerges on the topmost part of the shelf, all positioned above the original coat rack.
