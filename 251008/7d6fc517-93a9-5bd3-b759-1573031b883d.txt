A paved two-lane road curves slightly left into the distance, with a yellow right-turn arrow sign visible to the immediate right of the viewer. Steep, rocky mountains flank both sides, densely covered in evergreen trees on the left and sparsely vegetated on the right, all beneath a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the initial yellow sign and a newly revealed grey square sign directly behind it on the right gradually recede and then exit the frame to the right. The road continues its leftward curve, revealing more of the steep, tree-lined mountain slopes on both sides, with the overall landscape drawing closer and broader into view.
