The first frame captures a wide-angle view inside a brightly lit, modern hall, likely a shopping concourse or airport. To the viewer's left, a large illuminated "vivo" advertisement displaying smartphones is visible, with two white planters holding green plants and purple flowers positioned in front of it. A person in a blue shirt walks away from the viewer on the left, while in the mid-ground center, two men walk away from the viewer, one in a black shirt and the other in a red shirt with a backpack, passing a prominent "BURBERRY" store entrance on the right. The hall extends into the distance, revealing a textured, patterned ceiling and other distant figures and shops.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the people initially visible on both sides continue walking further away from the first-frame viewpoint down the hall. A new person pushing a rolling trolley enters the scene from the far left side in later frames, gradually moving forward and towards the center-left. The two men on the right maintain their general trajectory, moving further past the Burberry store entrance, with the man in black slightly pulling ahead of the man in red.

The first frame displays a wide, brightly lit modern concourse with a large 'vivo X60 Pro+' digital billboard on the far left, a 'BURBERRY' store entrance to the right, and a distinctive patterned ceiling overhead. Several pedestrians walk forward in the mid-ground, with a white curved bench situated further ahead in the distance.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward and slightly right, causing the 'BURBERRY' sign to become larger and the digital billboard to shift further left relative to the center. The man pulling a suitcase on the far left gradually moves out of the frame, while other pedestrians continue walking away, making the overall scene appear closer. A dark object briefly enters the bottom right corner of the frame, further indicating the camera's rightward movement.
