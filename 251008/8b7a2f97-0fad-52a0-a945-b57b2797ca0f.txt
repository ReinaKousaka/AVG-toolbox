In the foreground to the left, a black scooter with two red delivery boxes displaying 'Pizza Hut' logos is parked. A wet street extends into the background, separated from the viewer's immediate sidewalk by a black metal fence, with several trees lining both sides of the street. Buildings with storefronts are visible on the far side of the street and along the right sidewalk, where a person with an umbrella walks away into the distance, all under continuous rain.

Subsequently, the foreground scooter is removed. Then, a silver car emerges from the far left on the wet street, moving towards the background, driving past the first-frame viewpoint on the left side of the road and continuing into the distance, while the person with the umbrella walks further away on the far right sidewalk.

The first frame presents a rainy urban street scene, with a black metal fence and wet tiled pavement in the foreground on the right, flanked by several tree trunks. To the left, a wet asphalt road with white and blue lane markings and yellow bollards stretches into the midground, where a silver car travels away from the viewer in the rightmost lane. In the background to the left, buildings with illuminated storefronts line the street, while a pedestrian overpass is visible further down on the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the silver car recedes further down the road and eventually moves out of sight, replaced by other vehicles, including a white SUV and a white van, that appear and continue traveling away from the viewer. A small, dark garment is newly revealed, draped over the metal fence in the mid-right, remaining visible throughout, as the rain continues to fall on all surfaces.

The first frame depicts a wet urban street scene during rainfall. In the immediate foreground, a black metal railing curves from the bottom left towards the mid-right, bordering a glistening, patterned sidewalk that extends along the right side of the frame, lined by several tree trunks. To the left of the railing, a multi-lane asphalt road, wet and reflective with white and blue markings, stretches into the distance; a silver car, a white van, and a dark car are visible driving away from the viewer on the left lanes, separated by a median of yellow and black bollards. Along the far left, behind the road, are storefronts with illuminated signs, partially obscured by trees, while an overhead pedestrian bridge spans the road in the background, and rain is visibly falling across the entire scene.
end of description
The silver car on the left side of the road continues to move away from the viewer, eventually exiting the frame towards the distance. The white van and the first dark car, previously ahead of the silver car, also proceed further into the distance relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Subsequently, a new dark sedan appears from the left mid-ground, driving along the same lane and progressing away from the viewer. Throughout the frames, heavy rain persists, consistently creating visible splashes on the wet road and sidewalk surfaces. No entirely new objects or scenes are revealed, only the continuous motion of vehicles and the ongoing rainfall.
