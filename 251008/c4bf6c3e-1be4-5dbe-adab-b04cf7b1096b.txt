The first frame shows a white building with a "Burger House" sign and two framed pictures (yellow and blue) on its facade, positioned prominently to the viewer's right. A white wooden railing and pergola structure are attached to this building. To the left, a black street lamp with a banner stands beside a sidewalk that runs parallel to a paved road, where a white car is partially visible in the bottom left. Various other buildings line the street further down on the left, with a mountain range in the distant background under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk, the "Burger House" sign and the blue framed picture, initially on the right, recede and eventually move out of view to the viewer's immediate right. Concurrently, a dark wooden fence appears on the immediate right, gradually replacing the white building facade, and the yellow framed picture also disappears. More distant buildings along the street and a blue vehicle become clearer on the left as the viewer progresses forward from the initial position. The original Burger House building is eventually entirely replaced by a plainer white building with an awning to the right. The black street lamp, initially left of center, shifts further left within the frame, revealing more of its base and the road ahead.

In the first frame, a black lamppost with golden Japanese characters is prominently in the foreground, slightly left of center, with a paved road to its left lined by multi-story buildings, and a sidewalk to its right, flanked by a wooden fence and a light-colored building, all stretching towards distant mountains under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
The viewpoint advances forward along the sidewalk; the foreground lamppost moves left out of frame, revealing more of the street ahead and the buildings on the right. Concurrently, a white car drives from the far background on the road to the left, passes the initial viewpoint's left midground, and exits to the left, while a blue car is newly visible further down the road in the distant background.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
From the viewer's perspective on a sidewalk, a dark gray bollard is in the lower left foreground. To the immediate right, a light-colored building with a dark double-door entrance and several windows extends into the midground, featuring merchandise and flowers outside a shop window further down. On the left, a two-lane road leads into the distance, bordered by buildings including a light beige structure with a person outside, a red brick building, and a white van driving away from the viewer. A small tree stands on the sidewalk in the mid-center, with utility poles and wires overhead, all under a partly cloudy sky and backed by distant mountains.
end of description
The white van, initially in the mid-left, steadily recedes down the street away from the viewer and eventually moves out of frame. Following it, a blue car becomes visible further down the road, moving into the mid-left area and then continuing forward out of the scene. The person on the left sidewalk briefly shifts position before disappearing as the viewpoint slowly progresses forward.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a sidewalk looking down a street. To the immediate right, a light-colored building features a display window with stacked boxes, a wooden lattice screen, and potted flowers. A slender tree stands on the sidewalk in the midground, while to the left, a two-lane road extends into the distance, bordered by a reddish-brown multi-story building and other commercial structures. Vehicles are visible further down the road, with mountains and a partly cloudy sky in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the sidewalk. The light-colored shop facade on the right becomes more central, revealing more of its details, and a dark trash bin appears next to the stacked boxes. On the left side of the road, the buildings and street draw closer, with a blue car receding and a dark car approaching from the distance. The central tree also moves progressively closer to the viewer.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows the viewer on a sidewalk with commercial buildings on both sides of a street. To the immediate right are buildings with large windows and roll-down shutters, and potted plants near the storefront. To the left, a two-lane road extends into the distance, bordered by multi-story buildings, including a prominent red-brick one and a white gabled house, with a blue car visible far ahead; a small tree stands on the sidewalk directly in front of the viewer.
end of description
A black minivan, initially visible in the mid-distance on the road, approaches the viewer from the left, passing the central sidewalk tree. Concurrently, a silver sedan appears further back on the road, also moving forward. Both vehicles continue to move past the viewer, eventually exiting the frame to the lower left.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a street scene with a bare tree trunk on the left in the foreground. A light-colored sidewalk extends along the right, next to a building with dark roll-down shutters that spans the entire right side. An asphalt road, with white markings, stretches into the background on the left, bordered by a red-brick building and another with a dark roof. A white car is parked mid-left, while a light-colored vehicle approaches in the far distance on the road, with a streetlamp visible mid-right. Distant hills are under a partly cloudy sky.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the light-colored vehicle in the far distance moves progressively closer to the viewer along the road. Simultaneously, a silver car, initially mid-left on the road, begins to move forward, away from the viewer. A blue car then emerges from behind a building on the left, following the silver car along the same path. The approaching light-colored vehicle continues to advance directly towards the first-frame viewpoint, passing the street pole on the right.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows the viewer standing on a sidewalk with commercial buildings on the right, featuring dark metal shutters and a green awning in the foreground. To the left, a street extends into the distance, with a white minivan approaching from the mid-left and a blue car visible further down, while residential and commercial buildings line the far side of the street. A tall street lamp stands on the sidewalk ahead, with distant hills under a partly cloudy sky completing the scene.

end of description
In subsequent frames, the white minivan moves closer, passing from the mid-left past the viewer to the near-left of the original viewpoint. A dark-colored car then emerges from the mid-left behind the minivan, following its path past the viewer. Concurrently, the blue car recedes further into the distance on the far-left side of the street.
