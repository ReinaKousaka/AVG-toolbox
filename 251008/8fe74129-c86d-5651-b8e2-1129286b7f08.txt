The first frame depicts a rainy city street scene from a low vantage point. In the immediate foreground, a black metal fence runs across the bottom, with a sidewalk, tree, and utility pole positioned to the right. Beyond, on the wet road, a silver SUV moves left, a white van recedes centrally, and a white sedan is visible to the right, while buildings with illuminated signs like 'CROWWAFFLE & COFFEE' and 'PARIS BAGUETTE' line the background.

Subsequently, the silver SUV exits left, and a white SUV with yellow markings appears from the far left, moving across the midground to the right. A large white and blue bus then emerges from the far left, prominently traversing the midground from left to right, followed by a dark sedan, as the street remains wet from the continuous rain.

In the first frame, the viewer is on a wet sidewalk looking across a rain-soaked street towards buildings. To the immediate left is a dark pole and a black metal fence, while on the right, a young tree stands next to a crosswalk. On the street, a black sedan is positioned in the middle-left lane, ahead of which is a white bus with blue markings; a white SUV is visible in the middle-right lane. Buildings with signs like "PARIS BAGUETTE" line the left side of the street, and more trees, pedestrians, and another white SUV are visible further down the right.

The black sedan, initially in the middle-left, moves forward and exits the scene to the far left. The white bus, initially behind the black sedan, also moves forward and out of frame to the far left, revealing the full extent of a white sedan in the leftmost lane that proceeds towards and then past the viewer to the far left. The white SUV, initially in the middle-right, moves forward and shifts slightly to the left of its original position. Pedestrians on the right sidewalk also progress slowly to the left, indicating continuous movement in the scene.

The first frame depicts a wet city street on an overcast day, with a prominent white crosswalk spanning the road in the mid-foreground. A white car is driving towards the viewer in the left lane, slightly before the crosswalk. To the right, a row of trees separates the road from a sidewalk with pedestrians, while further back, several vehicles, including a dark car and a white SUV, are visible or parked. Buildings with various illuminated signs line both sides of the street in the background.
end of description
The white car in the mid-left moves forward and exits the frame to the left. A dark grey sedan then emerges from the far left, moving into the mid-left lane and crossing the crosswalk towards the viewer. Subsequently, a silver minivan appears from the far left, following the sedan across the crosswalk. Finally, a blue and white bus, then a white SUV, sequentially enter from the far left, also driving towards the viewer. Throughout the sequence, other vehicles in the mid-right and background continue to move along the street.
