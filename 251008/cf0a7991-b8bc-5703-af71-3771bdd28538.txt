In the first frame, a traditional multi-story wooden building with intricate wooden balconies, windows featuring light wooden shutters, and flower boxes displaying red blooms dominates the left and center. In the immediate foreground to the left, vibrant red and purple flowers in pots sit beside a partially open wooden door. A dark grey station wagon is parked centrally on a paved surface, with another closed wooden door visible behind its left side. To the right of the car, a narrow path extends into the distance, bordered on the far right by a steep, green-foliaged bank, with distant mountains and a blue sky visible beyond. A white umbrella and a small building with a red roof are visible further down the path on the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the camera slowly tracks right and slightly forward. The red and purple flowers and the partially open door on the far left of the initial view move out of the frame. Concurrently, the grey station wagon becomes more central and appears larger, while elements previously to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, such as a light blue scooter and more of the paved path and adjacent green hillside, are increasingly revealed.
