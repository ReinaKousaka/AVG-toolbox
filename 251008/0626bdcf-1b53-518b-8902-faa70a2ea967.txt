In the first frame, a house with a thatched roof, brick walls, and dark shutters stands slightly right of center, fronted by a vibrant green lawn. A dense green hedge occupies the immediate foreground, while a large, bare-branched tree is prominent on the left, partially obscuring the house. Another thatched-roof house is visible further right in the background, behind a hedge. end of description
The viewpoint then slowly pans to the left and slightly recedes, gradually revealing more of the landscape to the far left of the initial scene, including additional bare trees. This movement causes the main house to shift slightly right within the frame, and the distant house to move further out of view to the right.
