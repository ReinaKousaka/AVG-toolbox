The first frame captures a wet village street under a cloudy sky, with yellow pedestrian crossing stripes in the foreground. To the left, a partial yellow building and a blue pedestrian crossing sign are visible, while traditional wooden buildings line the right side of the road leading towards towering rock cliffs in the background. A dark grey sedan is positioned over the rightmost stripes.

The dark grey sedan proceeds further down the street, as a person holding a red umbrella on the right sidewalk also moves away from the viewer. Simultaneously, a person in a plaid shirt emerges on the left sidewalk, walking towards the viewer from the midground. Subsequently, a white SUV enters the frame from the far right and drives across the foreground and past the viewer over the pedestrian crossing.

In the first frame, a man in a plaid shirt and jeans walks on a wet sidewalk in the left foreground, approaching the viewer. To his left and slightly behind, a grey display board is visible, with a parked dark car further back. A wet asphalt road stretches away from the viewer in the center, alongside which a white SUV drives in the midground on the right. Directly to the right, a traditional multi-story building with brown facades and green shutters lines the street. In the midground-background, more buildings are visible, including one with a red and white Swiss flag, leading towards towering green mountains on the left and a sheer rock face with a waterfall on the right, all under an overcast sky.

The man walks towards and then past the viewer, exiting the frame to the far left. The white SUV in the midground drives further away, while a silver SUV appears from the right midground, driving towards the viewer along the road. This silver SUV passes the initial white SUV, eventually becoming closer to the viewer than the white SUV's first-frame position. Concurrently, two pedestrians become visible on the right sidewalk in the midground, walking towards the viewer. The signboard on the left moves slightly into the far-left foreground as the man passes it.

The first frame shows a wet paved street leading into a mountainous valley under an overcast sky. To the left, an information board is partially visible, alongside parked cars including a black SUV. On the right, traditional multi-story buildings line the street, where two pedestrians are walking, and in the background, towering rocky cliffs with waterfalls rise.
end of description
Subsequently, the black SUV on the left slowly moves forward. The pedestrians on the right walk further down the street, eventually exiting the frame as a white hatchback and then a light grey van enter from the right, driving across the frame to the left.
