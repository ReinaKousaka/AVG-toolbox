The first frame shows a man in a white Coca-Cola sweatshirt and red shorts, wearing headphones, walking towards the right in the midground, with a woman in brown slightly behind him. To the far left stands a green utility box covered in posters, while orange construction barriers and concrete blocks span the midground right, backed by construction fencing. A third person is partially visible on the far right, and modern buildings loom in the background.

The man in the Coca-Cola shirt and the woman in brown continue walking right, progressively exiting the frame. Concurrently, a yellow taxi and a white van appear from the background far left, moving right behind the construction barriers, with other pedestrians also emerging in the background.
