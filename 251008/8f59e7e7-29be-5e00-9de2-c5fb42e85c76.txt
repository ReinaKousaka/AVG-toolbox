The first frame depicts an outdoor parking lot under a clear blue sky, featuring five cars parked horizontally: a white minivan closest on the right, followed by a blue sports car, another white minivan, a grey sedan, and a silver sedan on the left. Behind the cars, white multi-story buildings flank a dark brown, older-looking house in the center, while scaffolding covers a building on the far left. A utility box is visible in the extreme left foreground. end of description
Frames 2 through 5 remain static with no changes. In frame 6, a person's head and shoulders, wearing dark clothing, begin to enter the bottom left corner of the frame, moving rightward. This movement continues through subsequent frames, with the person's back increasingly visible in the foreground, obscuring part of the utility box on the left by the final frame.
