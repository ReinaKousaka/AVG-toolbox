The first frame captures a bustling city street at night, with a prominent black car in the lower-middle foreground moving towards the right. To the left, the back of a person in a beige coat and striped scarf is visible. Numerous pedestrians fill the midground, walking between buildings lining both sides of the street. Directly ahead, a large building is illuminated with a dynamic, abstract red and blue projection, featuring multiple dark windows. Overhead, white string lights are strung across the street in festive arches, and buildings on both sides also display decorative lighting.

As the frames progress, the black car, initially in the lower-middle foreground, proceeds to the viewer's right, gradually moving out of frame. The abstract projection on the central building, directly ahead, continuously evolves its patterns and colors, showcasing fluid shifts in red, blue, and white hues. Simultaneously, the many pedestrians in the midground continue to move and shift positions relative to each other and the static background street.
