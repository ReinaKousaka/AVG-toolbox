In the first frame, a white van/car occupies the immediate left foreground, positioned next to a white rectangular post. On the immediate right, a tall building displays a vertical directory sign, featuring multiple businesses like 'BIRTH' and 'HIPS Studio'. Between these foreground elements, a street extends into the distance, lined by multi-story buildings on both sides, culminating in a visible crosswalk and faint vehicles further along.

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint advances forward along the street. The white van/car and the white post on the left, along with the vertical directory sign on the right, progressively move out of frame. This motion fully reveals the right-side building's textured facade and an previously obscured sign reading 'KOBEC OTEMACHI', situated further along the building from the first-frame viewpoint, while the distant street and crosswalk become more central.

In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a narrow asphalt pedestrian path in a city, looking forward down a street lined with buildings. To the viewer's immediate right, a dark grey, textured stone building wall with a sign reading "KOBEC OTEMA..." and a recessed entrance is visible, along with two metal posts featuring colored stickers at the bottom right. Further along the right sidewalk, a row of blue-and-white cones is spaced out, and beyond them, a modern building with large glass windows and dark lower sections extends forward. To the left of the pedestrian path, a wider asphalt road is present, featuring orange markings and a white crosswalk in the mid-distance, with two cars far in the background. On the far left, a grey building with numerous windows stands, followed by another modern glass-fronted building with some reddish sections further down the street, while power lines crisscross overhead.

As the viewpoint moves forward along the pedestrian path, the textured building wall and metal posts on the viewer's immediate right recede to the right and eventually out of view. The line of blue-and-white cones on the right sidewalk is approached and passed, progressively revealing more of the sidewalk ahead. A gridded manhole cover appears on the path ahead of the viewer, steadily moving closer as the scene progresses. The crosswalk and the distant white vehicle also appear to draw nearer, maintaining their positions relative to the street ahead.

The first frame displays a city street with a gray asphalt road bordered by a sidewalk on the right. On the sidewalk, several blue and white parking cones are lined up along a dark building on the far right. A white crosswalk is visible across the street to the left, while a white pole with traffic signs stands on the curb in the midground. Modern glass-fronted buildings line both sides of the street, receding into the background where a tall green tree and two distant cars are visible under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The pedestrian crosswalk and the white traffic sign pole, initially in the midground, shift towards the left foreground and enlarge. Concurrently, the line of blue and white parking cones on the right moves past the viewer's initial position, receding towards the right midground. The buildings on both sides of the street, including the dark structure on the right and the glass one on the left, become larger and move towards the edges of the frame as the perspective approaches them. The distant white and dark cars in the background also grow in size, becoming more defined as the viewer advances towards their original position.
