In the first frame, the viewer stands on a paved sidewalk. To the immediate left is a dark green lamppost beside a crosswalk and a green bike lane marking, beyond which a street features vehicles and apartment buildings. In the center-left midground, two people, a woman with light hair and a man in a plaid shirt carrying bags, walk away from the viewer. Ahead, a large, bare-branched tree anchors a park-like area, with more trees and buildings in the background. To the right, a brick building runs parallel to the viewer, and further along the sidewalk, an orange umbrella shades a vendor stall, near which a woman with a small dog on a leash and a man in a cap are standing.
end of description
The two people in the center-left progressively walk further away from the viewer, receding into the midground. Simultaneously, the woman on the right, initially facing the vendor, begins walking forward, away from the viewer, pulling her small dog on a leash with her. As she moves, she turns her head to look towards the left, revealing her profile more clearly, while the man near the stall shifts his body to face the stall more directly. All other background elements, including the buildings, trees, and street, remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

In the first frame, two individuals walk away from the viewer on a city sidewalk, with a woman on the left and a man on the right, both carrying bags. To the viewer's immediate left, a dark pole with a red 'STOPPING' sign stands next to a manhole cover, while a crosswalk and an intersection are visible further left. Buildings of various heights, primarily brick, line the street from the midground left to the background, and a black car is stationary near the left crosswalk. To the midground right, a large tree with bare branches precedes a street vendor stall with an orange umbrella on the far right.
end of description
The two individuals in the foreground continue walking away from the viewer. Concurrently, the black car previously near the left crosswalk begins moving from left to right across the intersection, gradually receding further to the right. A new person emerges from the far left, walking rightward along the distant crosswalk.

The first frame shows a street scene under a cloudy sky. In the immediate foreground, two people walk away from the viewer on a sidewalk; to the left, a street sign pole stands near a man crossing a white-striped crosswalk. Beyond, brown brick buildings line an intersection with traffic lights on the left, while a bare-branched tree, parked cars, and market tents are visible on the midground right, with tall residential buildings in the background. end of description In subsequent frames, the central two individuals continue walking away from the viewer, while the man on the left completes crossing the street and exits the frame. A white SUV drives across the crosswalk from left to right, behind the initial man, and other vehicles and pedestrians exhibit slight forward movement.

The first frame shows a bustling street intersection under a partially cloudy sky, with a sidewalk in the foreground featuring a manhole on the left and a metal grate on the right. Several people are walking away from the viewer on the sidewalk and crosswalk, including one in a grey top moving left-to-right. A white SUV is driving left-to-right across the street, past multi-story brick buildings on the left, towards a parked black SUV and chained bicycles on the right, adjacent to white tents, a large tree, and a tall brown building in the distant background, all overlooked by yellow traffic lights and street signs.
end of description
As the frames progress, the pedestrians continue walking across and away from the viewer, while the white SUV on the left proceeds further into the intersection, passing over the crosswalk. The person on the bicycle also moves further along the street to the left, revealing more of the road and buildings behind their initial positions from the first-frame viewpoint.
