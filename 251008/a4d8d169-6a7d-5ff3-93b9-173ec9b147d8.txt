The first frame shows a city street from a forward perspective, with a paved road leading into the distance, bordered by a curb and green foliage on the left, and a sidewalk with parked cars and buildings on the right. In the midground on the right, a tall building displays red 'BOSTON UNIVERSITY' banners, while a brown building with a red canopy is on the left, and a prominent cylindrical skyscraper is visible in the distant center under a cloudy sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the red Boston University banner on the right recedes, and new banners and street infrastructure previously further ahead appear closer on the right sidewalk. A silver SUV replaces the black Jeep initially parked on the right, and later a dark sedan appears parked further down on the right. On the left, the green foliage and fence move past, revealing a 'No Left Turn' sign and a street lamp pole previously further ahead. Simultaneously, the traffic lights directly ahead turn green, and new crosswalk markings appear on the road surface immediately in front of the camera's new position.

The first frame shows a road stretching away from the viewer towards a city skyline under a cloudy sky. To the viewer's immediate left, there's a sidewalk with green bushes, followed by a median with train tracks and utility poles, and buildings in the far distance. Prominently on the left, a "No Left Turn" sign is visible. Directly ahead, a traffic light displays a green circle, with a dark vehicle further down the road. To the viewer's right, a sidewalk borders storefronts, featuring a parked dark car near the viewer and another traffic light with a green arrow.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the "No Left Turn" sign to the immediate left moves out of frame. The traffic light directly ahead and the one to the right both transition to display green arrows pointing straight as the viewer approaches the intersection. The dark car initially parked on the right moves forward and is then passed by the viewer, while a new "No Left Turn" sign appears overhead at the intersection. More of the train tracks to the left become visible, and new storefront details, including "Starbucks Coffee," become clearer on the right.

The first frame shows a city street extending forward, with a black car moving away from the viewer in the center lane. To the left, there's a grassy median, a black metal fence, and a row of small trees, behind which a brick building and a white utility vehicle are partially visible, with distant skyscrapers beyond. To the right, a sidewalk features a Starbucks coffee shop under an awning and a large, modern glass building, with several people walking and a lamppost.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the Starbucks awning recedes out of view to the right, revealing more of the sidewalk and the glass building's facade, including banners and more pedestrians. On the left, the white utility vehicle behind the fence becomes more fully visible as the viewer approaches its initial position. Further progression reveals new sections of the street and a "No Entry" sign appearing on the left side of the frame, relative to the initial viewpoint.
