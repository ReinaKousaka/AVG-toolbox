The first frame depicts a wet urban street scene viewed from a sidewalk, featuring two tree trunks and a lamppost in the right foreground, beside an asphalt road with white crosswalk lines and arrows. In the midground, a person with a white umbrella stands near a black car on the right, while across the street to the left, pedestrians with umbrellas are seen near buildings, including a Starbucks.

In subsequent frames, the person with the white umbrella on the right steadily moves left, crossing the street, as the black car behind them proceeds further left and out of view. Vehicles on the main road also advance, and eventually, a new pedestrian with a light-colored umbrella emerges on the far-left sidewalk, previously obscured.

In the first frame, a wet city street is visible under a light rain. A dark pole stands prominently in the right foreground, with a small tree to its right. To the left, a zebra crossing extends across the midground, where a person holding a white umbrella is walking from left to right. On the far left, a blue building housing a dentist and a Starbucks is visible. On the right sidewalk, another person holding a white umbrella stands near a stopped black car, traffic lights, and a blue parking sign.

As the frames progress, the person on the left continues walking across the zebra crossing towards the viewer's right. A truck with a red cab appears in the distant background, moving left behind the stopped black car. Following this, a black SUV drives from the left across the midground zebra crossing, moving towards the right. Finally, a black sedan appears behind the original stationary black car, driving left into the distance.
