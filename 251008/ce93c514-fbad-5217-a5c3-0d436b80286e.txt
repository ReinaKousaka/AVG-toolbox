The first frame depicts a snow-covered street with a traditional tiled wall extending along the left side from the foreground towards the mid-distance. On the right, a snow-laden sidewalk runs parallel to a street with cars and a pedestrian, dominated by a large tree trunk and a lamp post in the right foreground.

As the viewpoint moves forward along the path, the large tree trunk and lamp post, initially on the far right, progressively shift further right and slightly behind the initial first-frame viewpoint. Meanwhile, new sections of the traditional wall and roof become visible closer on the left, previously hidden further ahead from the first frame's perspective. The blue sign and the street with parked cars ahead appear progressively closer to the viewer's current position as the camera advances.

The first frame shows a snow-covered sidewalk in the foreground, with a traditional-style wall topped with tiled eaves on the immediate left. Beyond the wall, a snow-covered building and bare trees are visible, along with a modern white building further back. To the right, a large tree trunk dominates the right foreground, while a glowing vertical sign with Korean text ('편안한집') stands mid-ground on the left side of the sidewalk. Further right, a snow-dusted road extends into the distance with parked cars, and orange traffic cones line the road's edge.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint slightly advances forward, revealing more of the snowy sidewalk and road ahead while snow continues to fall. A person holding an umbrella emerges from the mid-right, walking away from the viewer down the road. Shortly after, another person wearing a blue jacket and carrying a backpack appears closer on the right side of the road, also walking away into the distance. A smaller white signboard, initially partially obscured, becomes fully visible to the left of the main illuminated sign.
