The first frame displays a street view looking forward, with a road receding into the distance. In the immediate foreground, orange and white construction barrels and a dark construction sign on a trailer are positioned on the left side of the road. To the left, a classical-style building with columns and a row of palm trees line the street. To the right, a large white building features a prominent vertical digital billboard displaying a man in white, below the "Harrah's" sign. In the midground, several cars drive away from the viewer, while a large, curved building is visible in the background, straight ahead.
end of description
The digital billboard on the Harrah's building (to the viewer's right) dynamically changes its display, initially showing a man and woman performing music, and later a smiling man looking directly forward. Simultaneously, the construction sign on the left side of the road illuminates, first displaying an arrow pointing to the right, and subsequently changing to an arrow pointing left. The overall viewpoint subtly moves forward, causing the foreground objects to appear slightly closer.

In the first frame, an orange traffic cone and a construction barrier with a black sign featuring yellow circular lights are visible in the foreground on the left. An asphalt road extends into the midground with several cars in the distance. To the left of the road, a row of tall palm trees lines the street, followed by building facades. On the right, a large LED billboard on the "Harrah's" building displays a portrait of a person and text, with a spherical object atop the structure. A distinctive curved building (Treasure Island) and more palm trees are present in the background under a clear sky.
end of description
The large LED billboard on the right undergoes dynamic changes, transitioning from a single portrait and "HILARIOUS AND FASCINATING" text to multiple images of two men performing. Concurrently, the text on the billboard changes to "SAY YES TO HYPROV." The viewer's perspective slowly recedes backward and slightly to the left, revealing more of the "Harrah's" facade on the right and a building with columns and a billboard on the far left, to the left of the original palm trees.

The first frame displays a street scene with a clear blue sky overhead. A gray asphalt road extends directly in front of the viewer, receding into the distance. To the left, a classical-style building with columns features a large digital billboard displaying people, framed by tall palm trees and lush foliage. On the right, a modern white building with curved elements and a globe-like sculpture at its top is partially obscured by a massive vertical digital billboard showing colorful graphics and text "HYPROVA". Far ahead in the mid-ground, a large tan skyscraper is visible, and an orange traffic cone sits on the road in the immediate foreground, slightly left of center, with a white pickup truck parked on the left further down the street.
end of description
The camera gradually moves forward along the road. The orange traffic cone, initially in the foreground ahead of the viewer, recedes to the bottom of the frame and eventually exits the view, passing beneath the viewer. The white pickup truck, originally on the left side of the road in the mid-ground ahead of the viewer, approaches and then moves out of the left side of the frame, passing to the left of the viewer. The buildings on both sides, including the classical structure on the left and the modern building with the globe on the right, appear to grow larger, revealing more of their lower sections as the viewer approaches them from the initial viewpoint. Towards the later frames, a white crosswalk becomes visible on the road directly in front of the viewer, having initially been out of sight further ahead.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a wide street extends away from the viewer, flanked by sidewalks lined with palm trees and large buildings under a clear, light blue sky. To the immediate left, a white pickup truck is parked, facing away, with an orange traffic cone behind it, and further left stands a large building with a billboard. To the right, an ornate building with a curved, reflective facade dominates the scene, with orange construction signs near the sidewalk and a car further down the road. In the background, a tall, brown skyscraper is visible directly ahead, behind a row of palm trees.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the white pickup truck and the first orange traffic cone on the left gradually move past the viewer and out of the frame. The buildings and palm trees on both sides of the street slowly recede towards the edges of the frame as the viewpoint advances. The distant brown skyscraper and other background elements appear to grow slightly larger as the perspective shifts forward.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a straight road stretching forward under a light grey-blue sky. To the viewer's immediate left, a row of tall palm trees and a street light pole border the road, with small buildings visible behind them. On the viewer's right, a large ornate building with a prominent arched window and street-level shops is present, alongside a person walking on the sidewalk and a dark utility box. Further ahead on the road, several cars are visible, leading towards distant high-rise buildings, including a distinctive brown skyscraper, with orange traffic cones in the far left foreground.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the entire scene shifts, with objects appearing to approach and then pass. The row of palm trees on the viewer's left moves closer and subsequently begins to recede towards the left side of the frame, eventually passing the initial viewpoint. The large ornate building on the viewer's right becomes more detailed, revealing the illuminated text "THE VENNY" within its arched window as it draws nearer. Vehicles previously seen ahead of the viewer maintain their relative distance but move further into the distance, while the person on the right sidewalk also moves forward and then out of the frame to the right. The overall lighting of the scene gradually brightens.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a multi-lane road stretching forward, bordered by tall palm trees on the left and a large, curved building on the right, with distant buildings and vehicles visible ahead under a clear sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, the foreground palm trees on the left and the building on the right move out of view to their respective sides, revealing more of the hotel facade to the left and an ornate archway ahead on the left. Simultaneously, pedestrians appear on the sidewalk to the right of the original position, and the distant cityscape and vehicles recede further into the background.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a multi-lane street extending into the distance, bordered on the right by a large building, a sidewalk with black bollards, and an orange 'LANE CLOSED AHEAD' sign. On the left, a median features palm trees, with a distant tall building (Treasure Island) visible, and several cars, including a white pickup, are present on the road ahead.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the white pickup and other vehicles recede further down the road. Simultaneously, the palm trees on the left move closer and eventually out of frame to the left, revealing more of a decorative fountain structure in the mid-left. The building facade on the right slides past, bringing the black bollards and the orange 'LANE CLOSED AHEAD' sign progressively closer to the viewer's right.
