The first frame displays a two-lane street extending into the distance, flanked by buildings adorned with red flags and banners. Parked cars are visible on both the left and right sides of the road, with other vehicles driving away from the viewer in the midground, all under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, objects previously in the midground move closer to the initial viewpoint and past its sides. The parked SUVs on the left move off-frame to the left, revealing a red awning and a "POLICE" sign on a building further left, previously outside the first frame's view. A white crosswalk and turning arrows appear on the road directly ahead, while a motorcycle and pedestrians enter the scene on the right sidewalk, moving past the original viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a street intersection under a cloudy sky. In the foreground, a grey asphalt road with white crosswalk stripes, yellow double lines, and white directional arrows (left, straight, right) is visible, along with two speed bumps. To the left midground, parked vehicles, including a white SUV and a green and white van, are beside buildings with blue storefronts and traditional architectural elements adorned with red banners. Centrally, a white SUV moves away from the viewer, followed by other vehicles down the road. To the right midground, a sidewalk with parked motorcycles and buildings featuring traditional designs and red flags extends, with utility poles and overhead wires running along the right side, while distant mountains are visible in the background beneath the overcast sky.

end of description

The white SUV, initially positioned in the midground, slowly moves further away from the viewer down the road. Concurrently, other vehicles further along the street also subtly progress further from the viewer's fixed perspective. No new significant objects or scenes are revealed relative to the first-frame viewpoint as the camera remains static.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a wide street in a town, under an overcast sky that dominates the upper half. Multi-story buildings, adorned with red Chinese flags and lanterns, line both sides of the road; those on the left feature blue "China Telecom" and "vivo" signage, while utility poles run along the right. In the mid-ground, a prominent crosswalk spans the road, where several cars, including a white SUV facing away from the viewer, are visible; distant hills and more buildings recede into the background.
end of description
Across the subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly recedes from the scene. This slight backward movement causes the foreground elements, like the crosswalk, to appear closer to the bottom edge of the frame. Concurrently, the buildings and cars in the mid-ground gradually appear to move slightly further away from the first-frame viewpoint. The overall street scene subtly widens, yet no entirely new objects or areas are revealed beyond the initial view.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a wide street extending into the distance under a cloudy sky. In the immediate foreground, a pedestrian crosswalk spans the road. To the left, a building prominently displays "中国电信 China Telecom" and "vivo" signs, while further down the street, more buildings line the left side. On the right, several cars are parked alongside buildings with various shops, and a utility pole with a blue street sign stands in the mid-ground. Traffic, including a white van, is visible in the lanes moving away from the viewer, towards the distant buildings and hills.

end of description

The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the street. The white van, initially in the mid-ground on the left lane, progressively approaches and passes over the foreground crosswalk. Other cars further down the road also advance, continually moving away from the viewer.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a straight, multi-lane road under a cloudy, overcast sky. In the foreground, a white van on the left lane is moving towards the viewer, while the asphalt road ahead features double yellow lines and white markings. To the left and right, sidewalks are lined with buildings exhibiting blue roofs and various storefronts adorned with red banners and green signs, extending into the midground. Multiple cars are parked along both sidewalks, and several more vehicles are visible in the center lanes moving away from the viewer. A blue road sign with white text is suspended overhead to the right, and distant hills rise in the background beneath the horizon.

end of description

The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the street. The white van initially on the left moves closer to the viewer and then exits the frame to the bottom-left. As the viewer progresses, a pedestrian emerges into view on the left sidewalk where the van was previously. The blue road sign on the right, initially in the mid-ground, gradually approaches the viewer, revealing different Chinese characters with each advance. The parked cars on both sides and the vehicles in the center lane continuously recede further from the viewer's perspective.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A street extends into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings adorned with red banners and streetlights. Numerous cars are parked along both sides, and others are driving away from the viewer down the center lanes. A blue road sign hangs overhead on the right, and distant hills are visible under a cloudy sky. The closest objects are a partially visible white SUV on the far right and another white SUV on the left, both moving away from the viewer.
end of description
The viewer's perspective steadily advances forward along the street. The white SUV on the immediate left continues moving away from the viewer, eventually exiting the frame to the upper left. The partially visible white SUV on the immediate right moves forward, becoming fully visible, then travels to the right side of the first-frame's viewpoint and out of frame. Consequently, objects originally in the midground, like the blue road sign and parked cars further down, draw closer to the viewer's original position. New parked cars, including a red SUV, are revealed on the left side of the street, having been further down the road from the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a street view from a low angle, looking forward down a two-lane road with a double yellow line and a white arrow pointing away from the viewer in the foreground. Parked cars, including a red pickup and white SUV, line the left side, while a black SUV and a white pickup truck are parked on the right; a white SUV is centrally positioned in the moving lane, followed by other vehicles further ahead. Multi-story buildings with traditional architecture, adorned with red flags and lanterns, flank both sides of the street and extend into the midground, leading towards distant hills under a heavily clouded sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the white SUV in the center lane to recede further into the distance. Simultaneously, a pedestrian becomes more distinctly visible walking on the left sidewalk, also moving away from the viewer. The black SUV and white pickup truck previously on the right side move further away, with a new black car appearing parked on the right, slightly further ahead of their initial position.
