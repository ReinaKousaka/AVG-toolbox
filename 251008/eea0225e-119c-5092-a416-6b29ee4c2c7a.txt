The viewer is on a multi-lane road, curving gently to the left and ascending an incline. Directly ahead and slightly to the right is a grey sedan, with a white car further ahead in the left-center lane. To the left, a concrete barrier borders the road, beyond which are green trees, distant tall buildings, and a "Champion" banner showing a person's face on a pole. To the right, a metal railing runs along the road, followed by dense green trees, more distant skyscrapers, and a yellow upward-right arrow sign amidst the foliage.

As the viewer moves forward, the grey sedan and white car ahead continue to progress further up the road from the initial viewpoint. The banner on the left, initially displaying "Champion," changes to "Icon" and then "Fostered" as new sections of the street are revealed. A red "Road Work" sign also becomes visible on the right side of the road ahead, while a white SUV appears on a lower road level to the far left. The surrounding trees and city skyscrapers on both sides grow closer and more detailed as the viewpoint advances through the urban landscape.

The first frame shows a multi-lane city road with the viewer driving forward between barriers, lined by trees and tall buildings on both sides. To the left, a white SUV is visible, while a dark sedan occupies the right lane ahead of the viewer, with an overpass in the far distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses, both the white SUV and dark sedan move further ahead, and a new silver sedan appears from the far right in the foreground. Street banners become more defined on the left and right, and a "Hope St" sign emerges on the right as the viewer approaches the now closer overpass.

The first frame displays an elevated city roadway with a silver sedan in the right foreground and a white SUV in the left foreground, both heading away from the viewer. Metal railings line both sides of the road, behind which numerous trees with light green foliage are visible. In the midground, tall skyscrapers rise, and a bridge-like overpass spans the road in the distance, partially obscured by trees. Two billboards are visible: one with a man's face on the far left, and another with "Icon" text and a faint face on the right.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the vehicles ahead continue into the distance. The billboard on the far left moves out of view, while the "Icon" billboard on the right is replaced by a new "Icon" billboard featuring Marilyn Monroe's face, which then also moves out of view to the right. The concrete overpass, initially in the midground, progressively moves closer and eventually spans directly overhead of the viewer, revealing its underside structure.
