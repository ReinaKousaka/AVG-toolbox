The first frame displays a narrow, brightly lit street at night, lined with commercial buildings on both sides. To the left, several shops feature prominent yellow and white signs with Korean text, with a large vertical food advertisement standing in the foreground. On the right, stores with expansive glass windows, including a distinct 7-Eleven, are visible, alongside a small red-canopied stall in the foreground and a scooter parked on the sidewalk.

Beginning from the fourth frame, a green plastic crate dynamically appears on the ground. This crate is positioned to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, situated behind the parked scooter and against the 7-Eleven building. The crate remains visible in this location throughout all subsequent frames.

The first frame shows a narrow, illuminated city street at night, viewed from a pedestrian's perspective looking down its length. On the left, several storefronts with bright signs in Korean characters are visible, including a restaurant with blue awnings and clear plastic screens. To the right, a brightly lit 7-Eleven convenience store occupies the foreground, its large glass windows displaying products. A black scooter is parked in front of the 7-Eleven, with a green crate resting on the sidewalk nearby. The dark asphalt road, marked with faded white dashed lines and yellow curb lines, leads into the distance where more buildings and ambient light are visible under a dark night sky.

No dynamic changes, newly revealed objects, or scene shifts occur in the subsequent frames; the viewpoint remains static, depicting the exact same nocturnal street scene.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a narrow, illuminated city alleyway at night, extending into the distance. On the left, a restaurant with a large yellow sign and a clear plastic enclosure covers outdoor seating, with other storefronts visible further down. To the right, a brightly lit 7-Eleven convenience store is prominent, in front of which a black scooter is parked on the sidewalk next to some green crates. White dashed lines mark the center of the asphalt street, flanked by yellow lines along the curbs, leading towards more glowing buildings under a dark sky in the background.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward down the alley, causing the entire scene to advance towards the viewer's original position. The storefronts on both sides, including the restaurant on the left and the 7-Eleven on the right, progressively appear larger and pass by the fixed first-frame viewpoint. As the camera advances into the alley, a red circular 'Noraebang' sign on the right, previously further down the street from the first-frame viewpoint, becomes clearly visible. Additionally, more segments of the alley and distant buildings, originally ahead and further away from the initial perspective, are continuously revealed.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a narrow street at night, flanked by illuminated storefronts. On the left, multiple shops with various display stands, large fish tanks, and a prominent red awning are visible, while on the right, a 7-Eleven convenience store with a bright sign and a parked black scooter are closest to the viewer. The street extends into the dark distance, lined by more buildings.
end of description
As the viewpoint steadily advances along the street, the storefronts on both sides grow larger and details become clearer. On the left, a yellow advertising board and the shops with fish tanks move progressively closer and more central within the frame. Concurrently, the 7-Eleven sign and the black scooter on the right gradually recede out of view as the viewpoint passes them. The street's white dotted markers and the buildings ahead also appear closer as the perspective shifts forward.

The first frame shows a narrow, illuminated street at night. On the immediate left, a bright restaurant displays Korean signage, white globe lights, and two aquariums with a promotional stand. To the immediate right, a warmly lit wooden-paneled shop features outdoor AC units; further ahead, the street curves, revealing more distant shops and a bare tree.
end of description
The camera viewpoint then subtly moves forward into the street. A pedestrian subsequently emerges from behind the right-side storefront in the mid-ground, walking left across the street past the distant shops.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a night street scene, featuring a brightly lit storefront with a blue sign and posters on the far left, and a warmly lit building partially visible on the far right with a dark gray car parked next to it. An asphalt street stretches through the midground towards various buildings in the background, which feature illuminated signs, a bare tree, parked scooters, and a lone pedestrian further down the street on the right.
end of description
A person initially walking from the left storefront proceeds to cross the street towards the center, soon joined by two more individuals, forming a group of three. This group continues moving from the left midground towards the right side of the frame, while a small white figure and a blue rectangular object become visible on the left pavement behind them.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a vibrant night street scene. To the immediate left, a building displays a bright blue and white sign with Korean text, below which a person in a white coat and a blue box are visible on the sidewalk. Four people are seen crossing the street from the midground-left towards the midground-right. In the background, numerous multi-story buildings are illuminated with various storefronts and signs, including a "BAR" sign and Korean text. A dark car is present on the far right of the street, with two motorcycles parked on the sidewalk further back.
end of description
The group of four people continues their movement across the street from mid-left to mid-right, progressively nearing the right edge of the frame. Simultaneously, a small orange and white traffic cone appears on the sidewalk to the far left, replacing the person in white. A white car then emerges from the far left, previously obscured by the building, and proceeds to drive horizontally across the street towards the right side of the frame.
