A curved paved path, with a green hose and a yellow/red marker on its left side, leads into the mid-ground, flanked by lush green trees and bushes; a prominent evergreen tree is on the left, and a traditional-style building with a grey tiled roof and partially obscured dark wooden entrance stands in the background to the right of the path.

The camera subtly pans right, progressively revealing more of the traditional building's dark wooden entrance and intricate details in the mid-background from the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the large evergreen tree on the far left of the path slowly shifts further left, eventually moving almost entirely out of the frame relative to its initial position.

The first frame shows a curving paved path leading towards a traditional Chinese building on the right, featuring a grey tiled roof and light grey brick wall. Lush green pine trees are prominently positioned to the left, with smaller bushes flanking the path. A red and yellow marker is near the path's edge on the left, and distant tall buildings are partially visible behind the traditional structure. end of description. Subsequently, the camera pans slightly left, progressively revealing a pond situated to the left of the building and further down the path. A black lamppost with a white lantern then emerges from behind the left pine trees, moving into the mid-ground, while a traditional pavilion and a tall modern building become visible on the pond's far side and in the distant background respectively.
