In the first frame, a blue banner advertising 'JEWELRY & WATCH' hangs on the far left, partially obscuring a storefront with a 'Jewelry & Watch Batteries Repair' sign. Further right on the building facade, a neon '3rd eye SMOKE 'n' VAPE' sign glows, reflecting in the windows. On the sidewalk in the immediate foreground, a Hollywood Walk of Fame star is visible, and two people are seated near a tree trunk on the right. A street with moving vehicles and distant buildings lies to the right of the sidewalk, which is lined by several trees.

As the camera moves forward, the two individuals seated on the right side of the first frame move out of view behind the viewer's initial position. The initial shops on the left recede behind the viewpoint, and a new storefront featuring a large red neon 'TATTOO' sign emerges ahead on the left. Multiple Hollywood Walk of Fame stars become visible on the sidewalk in front of the viewer's initial position, replacing the previously seen section. Traffic on the street to the right continues to flow, with new vehicles entering the scene ahead of the original viewpoint.

The first frame shows a sidewalk with a "Walk of Fame" star in the foreground, bordered by a blue building with neon "TATTOO" and "ATM INSIDE" signs to the left, and trees lining the right side alongside a street with parked cars.

As the viewpoint moves forward, the "TATTOO" shop on the left becomes less prominent, revealing more of the "STUDIO CAFE" entrance further down the block. New "Walk of Fame" stars appear on the sidewalk ahead as the initial one moves out of frame. Vehicles on the right, including a white car and a black sedan, are seen moving along the street, getting closer to the viewer before passing. Pedestrians on the sidewalk also move, approaching and then passing the viewer's position, while a FedEx truck becomes visible further down the street.

The first frame displays a street scene with a sidewalk featuring pink stars on the left, leading past a blue-based storefront with large windows and a sandwich board menu. To the right, a tree, a pole, and a billboard with a man's image frame the street, where traffic and palm trees are visible in the background.

Subsequently, the storefront door on the left opens wider, revealing a 'CLOSED' sign inside, as a silver car drives further down the street on the right. A person in red sitting by the billboard on the right becomes visible, and another individual with a red rolling suitcase walks from the far background right, progressively closer towards the viewer's right foreground.
