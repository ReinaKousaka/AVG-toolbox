In the first frame, a snowy landscape features a grey minivan and a dark grey SUV parked centrally on a snow-covered patch in front of a multi-level building complex. The complex comprises a white lower section with two brown garage doors and an elevated glass-railed terrace, topped by traditional wooden buildings, while snow-capped mountains rise in the background under a clear blue sky.

From the fourth frame, a red Swiss flag with a white cross appears on a pole to the right of the central buildings and behind the parked vehicles, gradually becoming more visible as the camera subtly pans right. In subsequent frames, the flag begins to gently flutter towards the right as the scene continues its slight shift, revealing more of the flag and the adjacent wooden structure.
