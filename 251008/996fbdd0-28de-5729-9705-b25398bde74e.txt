In the foreground left, a green metal railing with a blue accessibility sign is visible beside a sidewalk where two men, each holding a white container, walk towards the viewer. To their left stands a stone building featuring a large green "Sinclair Centre" sign, while a city street with a green traffic light, a distant blue bus, and a red car parked on the far right recede into the background.
end of description
The two initial men continue walking towards and past the viewer, as a third and then a fourth man sequentially emerge from behind them on the same sidewalk, also advancing towards the viewer. Concurrently, the traffic light countdown timer on the right side of the building changes its numerical display, and the distant blue bus slightly recedes further down the street.

In the first frame, a stone building with a green sign and a green railing occupies the left foreground, while a person carrying books and a cup walks towards the viewer on the sidewalk beside it. A traffic light pole with a green signal and a pedestrian countdown of '11' is centrally located, with a street to its right where a blue bus, red car, and yellow car are moving away from the viewer. Buildings and trees form the background on the right side of the street.
