The first frame displays the illuminated entrance to "HUNDERTWASSER VILLAGE" at night, featuring prominent red and blue stylized lettering on a beige wall to the viewer's left, positioned above a colorful artwork depicting a whimsical architectural scene. To the right, an automatic glass door leads into a brick-walled interior with various fixtures, flanked by blue tiled columns and partially visible blue neon "VILLAGE" signage above the entrance.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts rightward, gradually revealing more of a large glass bottle-like decoration hanging from the ceiling to the right of the entrance. This shift also broadens the view into the interior through the glass door, making the "VILLAGE" neon sign above more completely visible.
