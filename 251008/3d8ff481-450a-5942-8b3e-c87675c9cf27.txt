The first frame captures a rainy night scene. In the foreground, a wet, patterned sidewalk with scattered leaves extends from the viewer towards the middle-right, where several trees line the path. A large tree trunk stands prominently to the left of the viewer in the near-midground, next to a wet road with visible white lane markings. On the road, a white car and a scooter are visible moving away from the viewer towards the left. Further down the sidewalk to the right, a red postbox and a street lamp pole with signs (a blue bicycle sign and a rectangular sign with Korean text) are present. In the background, illuminated buildings rise on both sides of the street, with more distant vehicles and streetlights visible.

end of description
The initial white car and scooter move further away on the wet road to the left of the central tree, gradually exiting the frame. Another white car then appears from the left, following the same path. Subsequently, a blue car and then a red car emerge from the left, driving along the wet road past the central tree. Finally, an orange taxi enters from the left, continuing the flow of traffic moving away from the viewer. The consistent rainfall causes reflections of city lights on the wet road and sidewalk throughout the sequence.
