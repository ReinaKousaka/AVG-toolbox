In the first frame, three orange plastic chairs are visible in the foreground to the left. Centrally, within a bright orange recessed entrance, two orange folding chairs sit in front of a yellow and gray vending machine filled with various products. To the far left, a dark brown door is slightly ajar, while to the right of the vending machine, a vibrant orange pillar features a large black and white Mickey Mouse graphic. A white car is partially visible to the far right, beyond the orange pillar.
end of description
The camera slowly pans to the right and simultaneously zooms forward, causing the foreground chairs and the chairs in front of the vending machine to move out of the frame to the left. This movement reveals more of the white car and the dark building behind it, which were previously positioned to the right of the first-frame viewpoint. The vending machine and the Mickey Mouse graphic become more central and enlarged, with the text on the glass pane to the left of the vending machine also becoming clearer.
