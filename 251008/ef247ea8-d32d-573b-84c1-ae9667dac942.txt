The first frame shows a spacious interior looking into a large entertainment room. To the left, a white wall with gray wainscoting runs from the foreground into the background, where two circular mirrors with gold frames reflect a green plant. A person in a gray suit walks away from the viewer, moving towards the mid-right. In the mid-ground on the right, a dark poker table with chairs is visible, and above it, numerous wine glasses hang from a brass rack, partially visible in the upper right corner. Further into the background, a seating area with a light-colored sofa and an armchair sits on a rug, in front of a coffee table and beneath a large black and white artwork on the back wall. A dark pool table and two closed doors are situated further back on the right.
end of description
The person in the gray suit walks further into the room and then turns to face the viewer, gesturing while moving slightly forward relative to the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, objects that were initially obscured become more visible: the poker table clearly displays cards and chips in the mid-right, and a full set of stairs with an iron railing is gradually revealed in the far right background, behind the pool table. Additionally, an extra armchair with a side table is unveiled to the left of the main sofa, further into the background on the left. The hanging wine glasses that were partially in the upper right foreground in the first frame are no longer visible.
