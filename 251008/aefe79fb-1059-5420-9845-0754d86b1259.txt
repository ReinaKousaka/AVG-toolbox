In the first frame, two orange traffic cones with "No Parking" signs are positioned in the foreground to the left. Behind them, several potted green shrubs line the left side of a wet asphalt road, which extends into the background with a yellow curved line. In the midground, a yellow and black striped barrier gate spans the road, with a dark grey pillar to its right, and parked cars are visible further down the road to the left. A reddish-brown building with green trim stands in the background to the right, behind which a tall residential apartment building rises. Dense green trees and foliage cover the left background.

A small, dark animal, initially appearing near the barrier's base in the midground, begins to walk from left to right across the wet road. Concurrently, the yellow and black barrier arm starts lifting upwards, allowing the animal to pass underneath it and continue moving away from the viewer. By the final frame, the barrier is fully open, and the animal has moved further along the road away from the original viewpoint.

The first frame displays a wet asphalt road with yellow lines and striped markings extending towards a peach-colored building with a green entrance on the right, and a tall residential building beyond it. To the left, a sidewalk with green bushes and potted evergreen trees runs parallel to the road, where several cars are visible further back. Two yellow barrier arms, one on the right with an automatic gate system, block the road ahead.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the right barrier arm slowly pivots upwards from its horizontal, closed position. It progressively continues to rise, eventually reaching a fully vertical, open position. This dynamic movement reveals the path of the road beyond the barrier, allowing access.

The first frame displays a wet asphalt driveway with yellow striped speed bumps in the mid-foreground, leading towards the background. Two horizontal barrier arms, adorned with signs, block the path across the driveway; the right arm's barrier post is on the far right. To the left, a grey sidewalk runs alongside a low green hedge, beyond which a grey building is partially visible. In the midground-right, a distinctive pink and green building stands, while further down the road to the left, several parked cars are discernible. The background is filled with lush green trees, and a tall apartment building can be seen rising on the far right.
end of description
Initially, both barrier arms are horizontal, obstructing the driveway. The right barrier arm then progressively rotates upwards from its right pivot, until it is fully raised and almost vertical. Subsequently, the left barrier arm also begins to lift from its right pivot, mirroring the motion of the first. Finally, both barrier arms are fully raised, leaving the entire driveway open.
