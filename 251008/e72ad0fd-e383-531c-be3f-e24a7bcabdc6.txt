The first frame depicts a wet city street at night, looking across a crosswalk towards an intersection. In the foreground, a striped crosswalk reflects numerous lights on the glistening asphalt, with two black bollards positioned on the sidewalk to the right. The midground features streetlights illuminating the area, trees lining the streets, and traffic lights showing red on both the far left and right, along with an electric scooter parked on the far right sidewalk. Distant buildings with illuminated signs are visible in the background.

Initially, the red traffic light on the right side of the intersection turns green, while a car with red taillights is visible moving away further down the road on the left. Subsequently, a large white sign with Korean text is revealed on the far left, extending upwards. A person on a pink and white delivery scooter then enters from the far right and proceeds to drive across the intersection towards the left side of the frame.

The first frame shows a rainy night city street with a wet crosswalk featuring white stripes and a red-painted lane horizontally across the foreground, flanked by two bollards on the right. In the midground, a scooter with a green delivery box is on the right side of an intersection, a dark car with red taillights is on the left, and streetlights illuminate the scene amidst trees and distant buildings against the dark sky.
end of description
The scooter, initially on the mid-right, moves left across the wet intersection, followed by the dark car from the mid-left, which eventually exits the frame. Throughout the sequence, heavy rain continues to fall, and the traffic light visible in the midground changes from red to green, allowing the vehicles to proceed.

The first frame depicts a rainy night street scene with wet asphalt roads reflecting bright streetlights and distant illuminated buildings. In the foreground, a red pedestrian crossing with white dashed lines is visible across the wet road, alongside black and white zebra stripes further forward. A utility pole stands on the far right, and a curb marks the road's edge. In the midground, a dark car with red taillights is positioned towards the left, while a lighter vehicle is near the center, both on the intersection's wet surface. Beyond the roads, a treelined median and buildings with shops and traffic lights (red) are visible in the background against a dark sky.

The primary dynamic change is a slow camera pan to the right, gradually shifting the perspective. This motion reveals more of the street and a tree trunk from beyond the initial right edge of the first frame's viewpoint. The dark car with red taillights, initially in the mid-left of the first frame, slowly advances forward and slightly further to the left within the broader scene. Meanwhile, the lighter vehicle, initially near the center-right of the first frame, drives forward and exits the visible area to the left. Throughout the sequence, heavy rain consistently falls across the entire scene, creating visible splashes and reflections.
