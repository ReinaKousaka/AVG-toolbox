In the first frame, a rainy city street at night shows a wet crosswalk and road in the midground, reflecting red and green traffic lights on both the left and right. A thin tree trunk with a black bin sits in the foreground, center, while a large building marked '교회' is prominent on the background left, and a streetlamp pole with banners stands on the midground right.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the camera slightly zooms and pans left as a dark car slowly moves from the far left of the frame across the crosswalk. Concurrently, the traffic lights on the right side of the street change from green to red, while the red lights on the far left transition to green, their vibrant reflections shifting on the wet pavement. Heavy rain visibly falls continuously across the scene, contributing to the shimmering reflections and blurring distant lights.

The first frame displays a rainy night street scene. In the foreground, a wet zebra crossing spans the bottom left, with a tree trunk slightly right of center and a pole holding red and yellow banners to its left. To the right of the tree, another pole features traffic lights (one green, one red), while the wet street reflects various colored lights. A white bus with bright headlights approaches from the midground right, with illuminated buildings lining both sides of the street in the background.

The following frames depict the white bus moving progressively from the midground right, across the wet zebra crossing directly in front of the viewer, and continuing its journey towards the far left of the frame. As the bus passes, the reflections on the glistening wet street continually shift, and the rain persists throughout the scene.

The first frame displays a rainy city intersection at night. In the immediate foreground, a wet crosswalk with white stripes is visible, with a dark utility pole positioned slightly right of center. To the left of the pole is a small tree trunk. Beyond the crosswalk, the street extends into an intersection, reflecting numerous city lights. Buildings line both sides of the street, with a red traffic light on the far left and another on the far right. A green traffic light with a blue U-turn sign is visible in the mid-right, while car headlights glow brightly in the distance straight ahead.
end of description
The primary dynamic change involves the traffic light located straight ahead and slightly to the right of the viewer. This light transitions from green to yellow by the seventh frame. It then turns red by the eighth frame, remaining red through the final frame. The other red traffic lights positioned to the far left and far right of the viewer's perspective remain consistently red throughout the sequence. The rainy conditions and their reflections on the wet street persist without significant change.
