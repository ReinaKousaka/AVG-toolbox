The first frame presents a rainy street scene with a wet, brick-patterned sidewalk extending from the bottom right into the mid-distance, featuring several black poles with banners along its edge. To the right of the sidewalk, a narrower greenish-blue path parallels it, leading to an embankment with green bushes and colorful signs. On the left, a wet asphalt road with white and yellow markings shows a queue of cars, including a black vehicle in the foreground-left and multiple white and grey cars receding into the distance. In the mid-distance on the right path, a person holding a black umbrella walks away from the viewer, while the background is obscured by hazy trees under heavy rainfall.

In subsequent frames, a silver car appears from the left, moving away from the viewer along the wet road. Concurrently, the person with the black umbrella continues walking further away from the viewer on the path to the right. Other cars in the distance also slowly advance down the road, while the heavy rain persists throughout the entire scene.

The first frame presents a rainy street scene with a wet brick sidewalk on the left, leading to a dark utility pole with a yellow sign immediately to the viewer's left. Next to the sidewalk, a wet asphalt road features several white cars moving slowly away from the viewer. A row of green-leafed trees stands between the sidewalk and the road. To the right of the sidewalk, a green pathway, equally drenched, shows a person walking away from the viewer, sheltered by a black umbrella. On the far right, a wall covered in colorful Korean advertisements is visible, backed by dense green foliage.

The person with the black umbrella steadily walks further away from the viewer along the green pathway on the right. Concurrently, vehicles on the wet road to the left of the viewpoint continue their slow movement forward. The heavy rainfall persists throughout the scene, maintaining a consistent downpour without introducing any newly revealed objects or scenes.

The first frame captures a rainy street scene with a person holding a black umbrella walking on a wet sidewalk in the mid-left, facing generally towards the viewer. To the immediate left of the person is a dark pole, and further left, a street with a black railing, beyond which a white SUV and a blue truck are partially visible. To the right of the sidewalk, a green-colored bicycle path stretches into the distance, bordered on its far right by a lush row of bushes and trees, and a wooden structure with green and yellow advertising signs.
end of description
The person with the black umbrella continues walking towards the viewer on the left sidewalk, then passes by the viewer's immediate left and eventually exits the frame. As the person moves out of view, more of the wet street, the line of trees along the sidewalk, and the distant vehicles on the road become fully revealed, extending further into the background relative to the initial viewpoint. The heavy rainfall remains consistent throughout the sequence.
