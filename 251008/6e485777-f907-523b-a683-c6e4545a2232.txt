In the first frame, a wet, dark asphalt street extends directly ahead, flanked by buildings. To the immediate right, a stone torii gate and a part of a shrine building are visible, alongside a low stone wall topped with a fence. On the left, a narrow concrete curb borders the street, with a pale multi-story building, then a smaller brown building with a red and white sign, and further buildings beyond. A person is visible on the sidewalk to the right, and a white car with headlights on appears in the far distance at the end of the street.

The viewpoint slowly advances forward down the street. The buildings and the distant white car appear incrementally closer, while the torii gate and immediate right-side wall progressively shift out of frame to the right. A parked white minivan gradually enters the scene from the bottom left, positioned to the left of the initial first-frame viewpoint. The person on the right sidewalk recedes slightly into the background as the viewpoint moves past their initial position.
