The first frame captures a rainy city street from a sidewalk perspective. To the immediate left, a dark metal fence and a tree trunk border a wet multi-lane road where a yellow bus, white truck, and white car are moving left to right in the midground, with tall buildings and an overpass further back. On the right, a long green hedge lines the wet sidewalk, with larger trees behind it.

As the viewpoint subtly advances forward along the sidewalk, the fence and initial tree on the left gradually recede out of view. Vehicles on the road continue their left-to-right movement, with the bus and truck moving further right and new cars appearing further down the road from the viewer's perspective. A dark sedan emerges on the road in the midground, moving right, and later, a person with a white umbrella becomes visible walking away on the distant sidewalk ahead.

In the first frame, a wet asphalt road stretches to the left, bordered by a black metal railing in the lower-left foreground. Beyond the railing, cars are visible on the road, and in the distance to the left, buildings and a concrete overpass rise. A prominent grey pole stands in the mid-ground on the left, with a small tree trunk behind it. To the right, a wet concrete sidewalk extends into the distance, flanked by a dense, green hedge. Further right and behind the hedge, a line of trees with green foliage is visible, and an overcast sky with falling rain dominates the upper half of the scene.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the camera slowly zooms in and pans slightly to the right, causing the large grey pole and associated tree to shift further left and become more prominent on the left edge. The green hedge on the right also becomes more detailed and occupies a larger portion of the right side of the frame. Traffic on the wet road, including cars and a bus, continually moves from left to right in the mid-ground. The rain consistently falls across all frames.

The first frame displays a rainy urban street scene from the perspective of a sidewalk. A dark tree trunk occupies the far left foreground, alongside a black metal fence separating the sidewalk from a wet road. To the right of the fence, a wet sidewalk stretches into the mid-distance, bordered on its right by a dense green hedge. On the wet road to the left, several vehicles including a blue bus and white cars are visible, while an elevated road or bridge spans horizontally in the background, with tall buildings behind it under an overcast sky.

Rain continues throughout the scene. Over the subsequent frames, vehicles on the wet road subtly shift positions. A yellow bus then appears from the right mid-ground, moving forward along the road towards the foreground. This yellow bus proceeds past a speed limit sign, continuing its movement towards the main intersection area on the right side of the road, becoming more prominent in the mid-ground. Meanwhile, the blue bus and other cars in the left lanes of the road continue their slow, forward progression.
