The first frame captures a rainy street scene with a prominent tree trunk and planter box on the left foreground, bordering a sidewalk that extends alongside a receding row of trees and a light-colored wall, while a dark grey SUV with illuminated headlights occupies the immediate right foreground of a reflective, wet asphalt road, moving towards the viewer.

The dark grey SUV from the foreground moves past the viewer to the left, revealing a white light truck with a blue cargo area approaching from the same road, initially positioned behind where the SUV was. This white truck then proceeds past the viewer and exits to the left, as a second dark grey SUV becomes visible further down the road, also approaching the first-frame viewpoint. Subsequently, an orange car appears in the distance behind the second SUV, continuing to move towards the viewer.

The first frame shows a rainy street scene with a dark gray sedan, headlights on, approaching the viewer from the immediate right. A wet asphalt road with a solid yellow line leads into the distance, where an orange car with illuminated headlights is also approaching. To the viewer's left, a sidewalk lined with several tall trees runs alongside a light-colored wall, while more trees and distant buildings are visible on the right side of the street.

The dark gray car on the right continues to move past the viewer towards the left. Concurrently, the orange car in the mid-distance steadily approaches, revealing itself as a taxi with its rooftop sign and side decals becoming clearly visible. As the taxi draws closer, another dark vehicle emerges behind it, also moving towards the viewer along the same wet road. The rain persists, creating splashes and reflections on the constantly wet road surface.

A rainy street scene features an orange taxi partially visible on the bottom right, a dark grey sedan with headlights on driving towards the viewer in the midground, and a wet sidewalk with trees lining the left side.
end of description
The orange taxi quickly exits to the left, while the dark grey sedan continues its approach, eventually occupying more of the foreground. Behind the grey sedan, a black sedan, then a red sedan with illuminated brake lights, move forward from the midground right. A white sedan subsequently appears further back in the midground, also approaching the viewer. All visible vehicles proceed forward relative to the initial viewpoint on the wet road.
