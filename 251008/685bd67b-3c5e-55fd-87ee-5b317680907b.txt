In the first frame, a group of people walk away from the viewer on a dark sidewalk to the left, bordered by a light-colored wall with some foliage. To the right, a black decorative railing sits atop a low wall, separating the sidewalk from a multi-lane road where a black car with illuminated headlights passes from right to left. Beyond the road, a towering, brightly lit building with numerous windows, identified as Caesars Palace, dominates the right background under a dark, cloudy sky.

As the viewpoint moves forward, the group of people continues walking away, and the black car exits the frame to the left, while new vehicles become visible on the road. Progressively more of the brightly lit Caesars Palace building on the right is revealed, extending further into the distance, and new orange traffic cones appear along the right side of the road. The decorative railing and sidewalk also extend further forward as the scene unfolds.
