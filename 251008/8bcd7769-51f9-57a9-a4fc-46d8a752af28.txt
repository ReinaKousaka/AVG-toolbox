The first frame depicts a covered walkway extending into the background, with a traditional garden on the left and a white building featuring an octagonal window and a pond below on the right. In the foreground, a man in a green shirt is on the left, another person's head is on the far right, and a woman in a light dress stands further down the walkway on the left.

The man in the foreground left moves right across the screen, partially revealing a woman in sunglasses sitting on the wall to the left of the walkway before both foreground figures exit right. As they depart, more of the white building, the pond, and the garden area become visible to the right and left, respectively, while a blue sign appears on the right wall in the mid-ground.
