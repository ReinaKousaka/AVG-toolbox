The first frame depicts a busy city sidewalk looking forward. In the immediate right foreground is the back of a person in a light blue hoodie and black backpack. Ahead in the midground, a person in a black hat and jacket pulls a rolling bag, while other pedestrians, including one in a red plaid shirt and another in a maroon top, walk away from the viewer. To the left, a modern building with pillars stands behind a planter, where a man in a blue vest uses his phone. The street to the right features traffic, including a distant blue bus and black SUV, with tall city buildings lining the background.

As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the sidewalk, causing all foreground and midground pedestrians, including the person in the black hat and the one in the red plaid shirt, to continue walking away from the initial viewpoint. The cars and blue bus on the street also advance forward. A new pedestrian with a brown backpack appears from the far right mid-ground, moving forward, and a yellow taxi cab becomes visible on the street to the right of where the bus was. The man standing by the planters on the left remains mostly stationary relative to the building.
