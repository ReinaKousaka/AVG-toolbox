The first frame shows a rainy city street at night, with a wet road reflecting numerous lights. A dark pole with prominent red traffic lights is in the mid-left foreground, and a black metal fence runs along the viewer's immediate right, adjacent to yellow tactile paving on the sidewalk. Distant buildings with illuminated signs and streetlights line both sides of the road. end of description. Subsequently, the red traffic lights on the pole turn green, causing their reflections on the wet road to change from red to green. Concurrently, the crosswalk further down the road becomes more distinctly illuminated.
