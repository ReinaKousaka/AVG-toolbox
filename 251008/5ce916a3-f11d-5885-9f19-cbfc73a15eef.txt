The first frame depicts a city street scene at dusk, looking forward. Multi-story buildings line both sides, with shops and pedestrians on the right sidewalk near a street lamp pole displaying a banner. The street to the left contains several cars, receding into the distance under a cloudy sky.

Chronologically, a dark, star-shaped Christmas decoration positioned high above the street lamp pole in the mid-right gradually lights up across the subsequent frames. It progresses from unlit to fully illuminated and brightly glowing by the sixth frame, maintaining its festive brilliance thereafter.

The first frame presents a city street at dusk, showing a thoroughfare lined with multi-story buildings, all visible ahead of the viewer. To the right, an "ELLIOT RHODES" shop window, decorated for Christmas with a "20% OFF" sign, and a street lamp adorned with a banner and snowflake-like light are prominent, while cars and pedestrians occupy the street extending into the distance under a cloudy, sunset sky.

As the viewpoint subtly moves forward and right, objects on the right, like the "ELLIOT RHODES" shop and a pavement sign, become more pronounced as the viewer approaches them. Simultaneously, the street lamp shifts left across the frame, and a white car newly appears in the bottom-left foreground.
