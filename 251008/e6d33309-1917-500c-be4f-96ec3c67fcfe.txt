As the viewer moves forward through the corridor, the "fido" store on the right slowly passes, revealing more of its vibrant interior and signage until the 'fido' logo disappears from view, replaced by a plain turquoise wall section. Simultaneously, the "COACH" store on the left also passes by, exposing more of its interior and a person walking towards the viewer's initial position. The black "$45" promotional stand from the "fido" store moves closer on the right before exiting the frame. The overall scene progresses, revealing new segments of the corridor and additional distant stores.

As the camera moves forward, the right-side sign and the blue floor sticker recede out of view to the right, revealing more of the "Club Monaco" storefront on the immediate right with its mannequins becoming more prominent. Simultaneously, the "COACH" store and the seating area recede to the left, bringing more distant storefronts into view as additional shoppers move throughout the scene, now appearing closer to the viewer's original position.
