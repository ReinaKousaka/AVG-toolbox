The first frame displays a vibrant park scene filled with blooming cherry blossom trees under a partly cloudy blue sky. A large, pink-blossomed cherry tree stands centrally to the right, its branches extending overhead, casting shadows on the grassy ground. To the left foreground, several people sit on blankets on a sunny, grassy patch, while further back, numerous individuals occupy park benches. A paved pathway runs along the right side, where two people stand near a camera on a tripod, and a chain-link fence with a hedge borders the scene. In the midground, beyond the central trees, a body of water is visible, with distant buildings and trees on the far shore.

In the subsequent frames, the scene remains largely consistent. A person on a scooter, initially visible on the path to the right of the central tree, gradually moves further down the path towards the right, away from the viewer. Simultaneously, a person along the water's edge, behind the right-side fence, slowly walks from right to left, moving deeper into the background relative to the first-frame viewpoint. People seated on the grass and benches in the midground exhibit minor shifts in their positions.
