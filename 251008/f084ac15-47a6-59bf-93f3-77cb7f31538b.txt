The first frame captures a rainy city street scene from a low perspective, with a partial blue vehicle visible in the far right foreground. A wide zebra crossing extends from the bottom center of the frame into the mid-distance on the wet asphalt road. To the left, a building featuring "다라플란트치과" and "KT" signs lines the sidewalk where pedestrians, many holding umbrellas, are visible. The road recedes into the background, flanked by trees and more urban buildings, with distant high-rise structures visible under a cloudy sky.

In the following frames, the pedestrian initially crossing the zebra walk from the left side of the street (relative to the viewer) steadily moves towards the right. This person, carrying an umbrella, progresses across the white stripes of the crosswalk. They continue moving rightward, eventually exiting the frame from the right side. Minor movements of other distant pedestrians and vehicles are also perceptible along the street (away from the viewer).

The first frame presents a wet city street, with a black and white pedestrian crossing prominently in the foreground. Buildings line both sides of the street, featuring various signs on the left and a multi-story structure on the right, with tall residential buildings visible in the far background. Cars are parked or stopped along the wet asphalt street, and several people with umbrellas are visible on the sidewalks.
end of description
Subsequently, a person with a black umbrella, initially standing on the left sidewalk near the parked cars, starts walking across the street from the viewer's left to right. This individual moves past the parked vehicles and continues across the street relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame displays a wet, reflective asphalt street featuring a white zebra crossing in the mid-ground. To the left, a silver car is parked near a rainbow arch decoration and some red, overturned barriers on the sidewalk, in front of buildings with store signs. On the right, a building marked "E mart" has stairs leading up from the sidewalk. A person holding an open black umbrella is visible on the zebra crossing, slightly to the right of the street's center, facing right. Tall buildings and trees line the background on both sides of the street.
end of description
The person on the zebra crossing dynamically moves from the street's center progressively towards the right sidewalk. Roughly halfway across, they close their umbrella, continuing their movement to the right. As they reach the right edge of the crosswalk, they reopen their umbrella and proceed to walk further right, off the crosswalk, eventually moving out of the frame to the right.
