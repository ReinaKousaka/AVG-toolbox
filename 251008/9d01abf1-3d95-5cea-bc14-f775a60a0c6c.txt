A person walks away on a paved path in the foreground, to their right is a black trash can. To the right of the path, a low hedge borders green grass, behind which an ornate glass building with people dining is visible in the midground. In the background, a large building with a distinctive roofline stands under a clear blue sky.

As the frames progress, the person continues walking further away along the path and subtly shifts left in the frame. The viewer's perspective appears to move forward, effectively passing the stationary trash can and causing the midground buildings to slowly shift leftward within the frame.

In the first frame, a black rectangular trash can with white icons is prominently placed in the lower-middle-right, adjacent to a patch of green grass. To the left, a paved footpath extends into the mid-left distance, where a woman in a light jacket walks away from the viewer, followed by other pedestrians. Bare-branched trees line the path, with a black lamppost visible behind the trash can. A low hedge separates the footpath from an elaborate glass and iron building (a conservatory or restaurant) stretching horizontally across the mid-right, with people visible inside. In the background to the far right, a large, light-colored classical building with balconies stands under a clear blue sky.

The woman in the light jacket on the footpath continues walking further into the mid-left distance away from the first-frame viewpoint. Other pedestrians on the path also move further away. Simultaneously, subtle movements are observed from people inside and around the ornate glass building to the mid-right. All architectural elements and static objects remain fixed relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
