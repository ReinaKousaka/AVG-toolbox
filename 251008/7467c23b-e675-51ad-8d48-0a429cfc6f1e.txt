The first frame features a grand, multi-tiered traditional building with vibrant red walls, green tiled roofs, and intricate decorations, standing directly in front of the viewer. In the foreground, a crowd of people gathers before a red wall, which includes an arched gate entrance on the left, both topped with green tiles.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly pans left, gradually revealing more of a large tree and additional people entering the scene from the left side, relative to the initial position. Simultaneously, some individuals on the far right of the foreground move out of view, and the red wall extends further to the right.
