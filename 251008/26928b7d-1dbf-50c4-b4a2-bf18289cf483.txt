The first frame depicts a cobblestone square under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a light-colored scooter is positioned slightly right of center, with a white/cream scooter to its left, and a dark scooter further left near a partial wooden bench and low stone wall. In the background, a ruined stone building stands on the left, a tall clock tower rises centrally, and a multi-story stone building with blue doors is on the right, where several people gather near a partially visible red scooter.

end of description
Subsequent frames reveal a gradual outward pan, progressively uncovering a wooden barrel that appears to the far left of the initial bench position. Concurrently, the red scooter on the far right, initially only partially visible, becomes fully exposed.
