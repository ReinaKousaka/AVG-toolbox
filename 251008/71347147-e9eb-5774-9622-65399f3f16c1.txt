In the first frame, the viewer is positioned in a bedroom looking towards a large window wall on the left, offering a bright city view with the sun shining. A dark-framed bed with a light mattress is centrally located. To the left of the bed, near the window, is a small round table, an armchair, and a tall floor lamp, with a large abstract painting and a white console table visible on the far left wall. To the right of the bed, a dark side table with a lamp and framed items sits next to a large mirror on the wall. A grey floor plan overlay is fixed in the bottom-left corner.
end of description
The camera subtly pans to the right, progressively revealing more of the mirrored wall to the viewer's immediate right and slightly reducing the visible portion of the leftmost wall. Simultaneously, the furniture to the left of the bed undergoes several changes: the armchair is replaced by a long sofa, and the floor lamp by the window cycles through different designs. The small round table near the window also transforms into a rectangular glass-top table. Additionally, the bedside lamp on the right side table changes its design multiple times throughout the sequence.
