The first frame captures a city street at night under heavy rain, with a highly reflective wet asphalt road dominating the foreground and midground. Trees line both sides of the road, behind which buildings with illuminated signs and scattered streetlights stretch into the background. In the midground, a red car with active brake lights is stationary on the right, while bright headlights from oncoming vehicles are visible further down the road, and a person with an umbrella is partly seen on the far right sidewalk.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the heavy rain persists, causing the reflections of lights on the wet road to continuously shimmer and ripple. The red car and oncoming headlights remain in their midground positions, exhibiting subtle shifts in brightness and reflection due to the ongoing precipitation, but no new objects or scenes are revealed or enter the frame relative to the initial viewpoint.

The first frame displays a rainy city street at night, featuring a wet asphalt road reflecting streetlights and numerous colorful building lights, with a white car's red taillights visible in the right lane ahead and bright oncoming headlights further down the left lane. Green trees line the left side, behind which city buildings and illuminated signs are discernible, while the right side shows a sidewalk lined with more trees, banners, and a pedestrian with an umbrella further down. The background reveals additional city structures, streetlights, traffic signals, and a blue overhead road sign.

Throughout the following frames, the heavy rain persists, and then a black minivan enters from the far left of the foreground in the left lane, driving towards the right, closer to the viewer than the stationary white car. The minivan proceeds across the frame, its prominent red taillights moving past the viewer.

The first frame displays a rainy city street at night, with a wet asphalt road reflecting vibrant red, white, and blue lights from the surrounding city and vehicle taillights. A dark SUV with bright red taillights is in the midground, driving away to the left of a lighter sedan with red taillights, positioned further down the road to the right. Tall buildings, streetlights, and green trees line both sides of the street, with a person under an umbrella visible on the far right sidewalk.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, both the SUV and sedan continue moving away from the viewer down the glistening road. A new dark car with illuminated headlights then appears from the far left, driving towards and then past the viewer in the left lane. The vivid reflections on the wet pavement dynamically shift with the ongoing movement of vehicles under the steady rain.
