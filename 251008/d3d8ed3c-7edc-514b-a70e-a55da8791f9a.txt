The first frame shows an ornate arched stone passageway on the right, leading into a lit tunnel with people and shop windows visible inside, while a white building facade with multiple dark-paned windows and a decorative black railing occupies the left side.
end of description
The view dynamically shifts rightward and slightly forward, revealing more of the arched passageway's structure as elements of the building and railing on the far left recede. A person in a dark coat and green hat gradually enters the frame from the far right, becoming a prominent figure standing to the right of the archway. Simultaneously, additional details of the tunnel's interior and illuminated shop displays on the right side become clearer.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame presents an arched stone passageway with a tiled floor, leading into a brightly lit interior bustling with people walking away. To the left of the archway are a window with a metal railing and a dark wooden door, while shop displays line both sides of the receding corridor. On the far right, a person wearing a dark jacket and a green hat is partially visible, standing near the archway's right column.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts slightly to the right and zooms in, gradually revealing more of the right side of the archway and its adjacent shop window. Simultaneously, the person previously on the far right slowly moves further out of view, while the crowd within the passageway continues to recede deeper into the distance.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The viewer stands within an arched, white-walled corridor or passageway, looking straight ahead into its receding depth. The tiled floor stretches before the viewer, flanked by shopfronts. To the immediate left is a tall, dark double door, while on the right, a brightly lit display case labeled "Souvenir" displays various items, with another illuminated display case partially visible closer to the foreground. Multiple ornate, dark metal lanterns hang from the arched ceiling, illuminating the path and numerous people walking towards and away from the viewer in the midground and background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly to the left relative to the first-frame's perspective. The man in the two-tone jacket and the woman in the black coat, initially in the midground, walk closer to the viewer and pass towards the left. Concurrently, the dark double door on the far left moves progressively out of view. More of the illuminated display case on the far right becomes visible as the camera seemingly inches forward, revealing additional items inside.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a vaulted, white-arched hallway or passage receding into the distance. Ornate black metal lanterns hang from the ceiling, with one prominent in the upper-center foreground. On the left side, multiple warmly lit shop windows are visible, including one partially obstructed closer to the viewer and a 'Souvenir' shop further down. The right wall features a 'Souvenir' display window showcasing various items, and a dark grate is partially visible at the far right edge. A light-colored tiled floor extends forward, and numerous pedestrians fill the passage, moving both towards and away from the viewer, with a woman in a dark coat and white scarf prominently in the left foreground.
end of description.
In the following frames, pedestrians dynamically move through the passage; the woman in the left foreground walks past and out of view to the left, and new individuals, like a man in a red coat and another in a black puffer jacket, move into the left foreground. Other people continue to walk further down the passage in both directions, constantly shifting their positions relative to the viewer. A distinct shaft of sunlight appears and extends across the tiled floor further into the passage, becoming more pronounced over time.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a long, arched indoor passage, with a souvenir shop window and a person in a black hat visible to the viewer's immediate left, and a "Souvenir" display case on the right. The passage extends into the distance ahead, populated by several people walking, under hanging lanterns and sunlit patches on the floor.
end of description
As the camera slowly moves forward, the person initially on the left exits the frame, moving further left relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Subsequently, more of the left souvenir shop's facade becomes visible further ahead and to the left of the initial viewpoint, while people in the distance move progressively closer to where the first frame was captured. Concurrently, the right-side display case appears to recede and shift further to the right relative to the initial viewpoint's position as the camera passes it.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a brightly lit, vaulted indoor corridor or walkway, extending into the distance from the viewer's perspective. To the immediate left, a shop window showing part of the word "OENIR" displays various items, with more shop fronts lining the left side further back. On the right, a plain white wall features a tall, dark, double-doored entrance in the mid-ground. A diverse crowd of people occupies the corridor, with two individuals in the mid-ground – one in a red plaid coat and another in a black vest – walking towards the viewer. Overhead, two ornate dark lanterns hang from the arched ceiling, and sunlight casts long shadows across the floor.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward through the corridor, advancing past the initial shop window on the viewer's left. The two prominent individuals initially in the mid-ground, a person in a red plaid coat and another in a black vest, walk past the viewer towards the foreground and then exit the frame to the viewer's left. As the camera progresses, a "PETIT-POST" shop sign, previously further down the corridor on the viewer's left, comes into focus and is then passed by. The dark double door on the right, initially to the viewer's right, slowly recedes as the scene continually unfolds further into the walkway, revealing more people and shops ahead. The dynamic movement reveals additional depth and elements of the corridor as the viewpoint advances.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a bustling arched corridor with a tiled floor, illuminated by hanging lanterns and natural light from the left. In the foreground left, a person in a grey hoodie is partially visible, while a couple walks towards the viewer in the mid-ground, past a 'PETIT POINT' shop on the left and a dark panel on the right wall. end of description. As the viewer progresses, the initial foreground people and the couple move past and to the left of the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, a white utility box and a tall brown panel emerge on the right wall, further down the corridor from the initial dark panel's position. Many other individuals continue traversing the corridor both towards and away from the first-frame viewpoint.
