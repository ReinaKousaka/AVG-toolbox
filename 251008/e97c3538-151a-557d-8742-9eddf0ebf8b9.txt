The first frame displays a city street with a pedestrian sidewalk on the right, featuring a black pole labeled "Musashino dori" in the foreground. To the immediate right, a building showcases large windows with bright blue and yellow signage, while across the light reddish-brown street to the left, numerous buildings are adorned with colorful, predominantly red and orange, advertisements. A silver car is parked further down the street on the right, with a red pole and a small tree on the sidewalk beyond it, and a pedestrian bridge is visible in the distant background.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the right sidewalk; the "Musashino dori" pole shifts left and exits the frame, while the red pole, tree, and silver car on the right approach the viewer's new position. Simultaneously, people emerge on the left sidewalk across the street, walking towards the first-frame viewpoint, revealing more of the storefronts as the scene unfolds forward.
