In the first frame, the viewer is on a multi-lane road looking forward into a city street. To the immediate left is a light-colored pickup truck, and partially visible on the immediate right is a dark gray SUV. Ahead in the midground are several cars in multiple lanes, driving in the same direction. On the left, a building with colorful art is visible, behind which a construction crane and another building rise; on the right, a tall, modern building with many windows looms, with several parked cars alongside it. In the background, an intersection with traffic lights is visible, beyond which lies a distant city skyline under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the road. The pickup truck on the left slowly moves out of frame, while a white sedan on the right emerges and passes. Cars in the central lanes continue to advance, and new vehicles, including a black sedan and dark SUV, become prominent in the left-center. The buildings on either side gradually move past the viewer, revealing more of the storefronts on the right and an approaching intersection with a red bus in the distance.

In the first frame, a multi-lane city road extends forward from the viewer, with a black sedan visible in the immediate left foreground and a white SUV positioned just ahead of it in the same lane. To the far left, a large building with colorful murals lines the street, topped by a taller building with a blue sign. On the right, a modern building with reflective glass rises sharply, with a red bus parked along the curb further ahead and pedestrians on the sidewalk. Straight ahead in the midground, traffic lights hang over the intersection, currently displaying a red signal, with more buildings visible in the distance under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's vehicle moves forward, causing the black car on the immediate left to recede and eventually exit the frame to the left. A white SUV, initially positioned mid-left, then advances to the immediate left foreground before also moving forward and towards the center of the road. Simultaneously, the traffic light ahead transitions from red to green, allowing the traffic, including the viewer, to proceed through the intersection. The urban landscape ahead becomes increasingly detailed as the viewer approaches, revealing more of the street and buildings previously in the midground.

The first frame depicts a sunny multi-lane urban street, featuring a large red bus on the right and a blue bus on the left, both heading away from the viewer, with a tall building topped in blue and a white building adorned with vibrant murals on the left, and commercial buildings lining the right side under traffic lights.
end of description
The red bus on the right moves forward and gradually exits the frame rightward, revealing more of the commercial building and storefronts it previously obscured to its left. Simultaneously, the blue bus on the left also progresses forward, followed by a black car, while other distant vehicles on the road continue to advance away from the viewer. A new white SUV emerges from the far left background, moving towards the viewer's initial position and then proceeding into the middle ground, eventually passing the blue bus. The scene overall advances along the road, causing objects near the viewer's original viewpoint to recede or move out of sight.

A city street extends forward under a clear blue sky, bordered by a tall building with a colorful mural on the left and a large glass-fronted building on the right. A white minivan is in the left foreground lane, a white sedan is in the right lane ahead, and other vehicles occupy the central lanes.
end of description
The white minivan moves forward and exits left, replaced by a silver sedan entering from the viewer's left and a white truck emerging from behind, both moving ahead in the left and center lanes respectively. As the viewpoint advances, these vehicles continue forward, revealing more trucks and cars further down the road in the left lanes as they approach the intersection.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a wide street scene unfolds under a clear blue sky. In the immediate foreground, dark asphalt pavement dominates, with two white box trucks parked on the left and a grey SUV behind them. Further down the road, multiple cars populate the lanes, including white and grey sedans, moving towards or away from the viewer. To the far left, a tall, light-colored building with many windows rises, accompanied by a smaller commercial structure below, while to the far right, a large, modern glass-fronted commercial building, possibly a showroom, extends along the street. A pedestrian overpass is visible in the mid-distance, and traffic lights hang above the intersection.
end of description
Initially, the grey SUV on the left moves forward, followed by the appearance of a black bus and a white sedan behind the trucks. As the camera progresses, the white sedan on the left enters the frame and moves into the foreground, while the initial box trucks and grey SUV move out of the immediate left side. The pedestrian crosswalk, previously partially obscured, becomes fully visible directly in front of the viewer. Concurrently, a white van with blue stripes and a black SUV appear in the lanes ahead, moving closer to the viewpoint. The traffic lights ahead transition from red/amber to green, indicating forward movement through the intersection.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a multi-lane urban street with a zebra crossing in the immediate foreground, leading to a road receding into the distance. To the left, a dark SUV and a white van with blue stripes are stopped, alongside a tall building on the far left, while a large, modern commercial complex lines the right side of the street under a green overhead traffic light.
end of description
As the viewer's perspective moves forward, the white van and dark SUV progressively advance and exit the frame to the far left. A black Audi sedan, initially behind them and to the left of the viewer's path, then becomes prominent in the left foreground before also moving forward and out of view. Consequently, the road ahead clears, revealing more distant buildings and a yellow taxi appearing further down the central lane.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a wide urban street on a clear day, with a multi-lane road featuring double yellow lines, white lane dividers, and a prominent white arrow in the foreground. To the left, a tall, gridded building stands behind a lower commercial structure with "ACE" signage, below which an elevated area contains parked cars and a bus stop. An orange car is in the left midground lane, and a silver car is in the right midground lane. On the right, a large modern building with a reflective glass facade lines the street, featuring various storefronts and a bus stop with a person near it. In the background, other buildings line the street, connected by a pedestrian bridge.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The orange car in the left lane initially moves closer to the viewer, then proceeds ahead and eventually passes out of view to the left. The silver car in the right lane moves forward relative to its initial position, receding into the midground as the camera advances. New white diamond-shaped road markings emerge directly in front of the viewer's path. The buildings on both sides of the street and the pedestrian bridge in the background steadily approach the viewer.
