A road extends forward from the viewer, flanked by sidewalks and fences. On the left is a building with a red roof and a flagpole holding a red flag; on the right, an orange dump truck is visible beyond a fence, with mountains in the background.
end of description
The camera moves forward along the road, causing the orange dump truck on the right to recede and exit the frame. Subsequently, a blue dump truck, initially positioned further along the road behind the orange one, is revealed on the right side and moves forward relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a paved road looking forward. To the immediate right, a sidewalk with a dark fence runs parallel to the road, featuring a yellow and white pole with a red flag. On the far left, a beige building with red trim is partially visible behind a large green tree, with more yellow and white poles bearing red flags receding along the left side of the road. On the right, a yellow dump truck with a blue bed is parked behind the fence, with a mountainous landscape and blue sky with white clouds in the background.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the road. The yellow and blue dump truck on the right recedes further into the distance relative to its initial position and eventually exits the frame to the right. The large green tree and building on the left pass the viewer, moving further left from their first-frame location, while new sections of the road and fence become visible ahead. All poles with red flags continuously approach and then pass the viewer, revealing more distant buildings and the uninterrupted mountainous backdrop further down the road.

The first frame depicts a paved road extending into the distance under a blue sky with fluffy white clouds. To the left, a large green tree and a flagpole with a red Chinese flag are visible, while ornamental streetlights with golden tops and red banners line both sides of the road, receding towards the background. Buildings are interspersed among trees on both sides of the road, with rugged, tree-covered mountains filling the distant background.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the initial left-side tree and flag move out of frame, revealing a white van on the left. New streetlights and sections of buildings appear closer, while a prominent streetlight with a large red banner emerges on the right, becoming central as the perspective moves forward.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A straight road extends from the viewer into the distance under a partly cloudy blue sky, flanked by a sidewalk on the left and a darker paved area with a fence on the right. On the left, a multi-story cream-colored building with traditional windows is visible, with several white cars parked in front. Ornate golden-topped lampposts, some displaying red flags, line both sides of the road, leading towards dark green mountains in the background.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the road, the rightmost lamppost from the first frame moves out of view to the right. Subsequently, a large yellow construction vehicle, initially unseen, begins to emerge from ahead and to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, gradually becoming more prominent on the right side of the road. Simultaneously, the multi-story building and parked cars on the left appear to recede leftward as new sections of the road and fence are revealed directly in front of the viewer.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
A paved road extends into the distance, flanked on the left by a multi-story building, a wall, and a fence, and on the right by a sidewalk, a dark fence, and trees, with buildings and distant mountains visible beyond. Overhead, a blue sky with white clouds is present, while several ornate golden-topped streetlights, some displaying red Chinese flags, line both sides of the road.
end of description
The viewpoint advances steadily along the road, causing the prominent streetlights and a yellow construction vehicle initially on the far right to move out of frame. As the scene progresses, new sections of the road and additional buildings are revealed further down the path, replacing the receding foreground elements. The red flags on the streetlights subtly wave in the wind, and shadows from the overhead streetlights dynamically appear and shift on the road surface before also moving out of view.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The viewer is positioned on a paved road extending into the distance, marked by a solid yellow line on the left and a dashed one on the right. Sidewalks, bordered by dark metal fences, flank both sides of the road, which is lined with yellow and white streetlights featuring decorative tops. The closest streetlight on the left prominently displays a red Chinese flag, while a partial pine tree is visible on the far right. Further down on the left stands a light brown multi-story building, and to the right, multiple pink and white multi-story buildings are visible against the backdrop of steep, green mountains under a blue sky with scattered white clouds.
end of description
The viewpoint moves steadily forward along the road, causing the initial left-side lamp post and flag to move upward and out of the top-left of the frame. All road features, including the fences and subsequent streetlights, continuously shift towards the viewer and then recede. A new, larger yellow-based lamp post with a red Chinese flag appears from the mid-distance on the right and gradually approaches the foreground. Distant buildings and mountains to the left and right slowly become more prominent as the perspective progresses forward.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a straight road extending forward, flanked by white and yellow streetlights, some flying red flags. A multi-story yellow building is on the left, behind a fence, and distant reddish-pink buildings are on the right, also behind a fence, all set against green mountains under a partly cloudy sky. A dark car is visible further down the road.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The closest streetlight on the right and the evergreen tree behind it approach the viewer, growing in size and shifting rightwards relative to the initial central viewpoint, eventually moving out of frame. Similarly, the buildings and streetlights on the left also approach and move towards the left edge of the frame, as new road sections and distant buildings continually emerge further ahead.
