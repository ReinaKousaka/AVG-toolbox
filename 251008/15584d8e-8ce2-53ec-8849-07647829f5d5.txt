The first frame shows a paved road curving slightly rightward into the distance, with a silver guardrail running along its lower left side and green grassy slopes on both sides. To the right of the road, two yellow "30" signs are stacked, and further back, a dark car is parked beside a white house with a brown roof; a dark wooden building stands slightly left of the road's center. A streetlight pole is on the left, and distant majestic mountains with snowy peaks rise under an overcast sky.

The two yellow "30" signs on the right of the road disappear, and a rectangular white sign becomes visible further ahead on the right near the parked car. As the viewpoint moves forward, the streetlight pole, "M MARTI" sign, and red and white construction barriers on the left shift closer and to the left, revealing a yellow excavator behind the barriers. The white house and parked car on the right move out of view to the right, while a new set of red and white construction barriers appears closer on the right side of the road.

The first frame displays a paved road curving gently to the right, leading into a valley surrounded by majestic mountains. On the left, a rustic wooden barn-like building stands beside a tree, with green grassy slopes rising behind them and distant snow-capped mountains filling the background. To the right, similar green slopes hold smaller houses further down the road, while red and white construction barriers are present on the near left.

As the viewpoint progresses along the road, the large wooden building and adjacent tree on the left move out of frame, revealing several white wrapped hay bales and a '50' speed limit sign on the left roadside. Simultaneously, the distant houses on the right become clearer and more central to the view, with the overall mountainous landscape shifting in perspective.

The first frame depicts a grey asphalt road with a central white dashed line extending into the distance, flanked by lush green grassy slopes. On the right slope, several traditional houses are visible, with a prominent white house to the mid-right, while a wooden barn-like structure and a deciduous tree with yellowish leaves appear on the left slope. In the mid-ground, a village is nestled amidst more houses and trees, set against a backdrop of distant mountains with forested lower slopes and snowy peaks under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the foreground recedes, and the surrounding landscape shifts. The houses on the right and the wooden barn on the left move further to their respective sides, revealing more of the grassy slopes and structures previously partially obscured. A red and white striped barrier pole, followed by a streetlight post, emerges and becomes more central on the left side of the road, growing larger as the viewer approaches. Additionally, cars beneath a shelter adjacent to a house on the right and more details of the village in the mid-ground become visible as the journey progresses.
