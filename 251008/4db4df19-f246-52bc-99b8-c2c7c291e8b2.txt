The first frame captures a bedroom featuring a large bed with a white tufted headboard and blue/white bedding at its center, flanked by nightstands with lamps and windows adorned with striped curtains and wooden blinds. To the left, an armchair with a straw hat and a small side table are visible, while a colorful abstract painting hangs behind the bed, and a lantern-style fixture suspends from the ceiling.

As the view slowly widens and pans right, a blue upholstered bench with books is revealed in front of the bed, closer to the viewer. A matching armchair then emerges on the right side of the room, also closer to the viewer than the right nightstand, with a sunburst mirror and a small framed picture becoming visible on the far right wall.
