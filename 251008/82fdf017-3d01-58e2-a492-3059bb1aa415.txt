The first frame shows a mountain road curving slightly rightward into the distance, with a white dashed line marking its center. To the viewer's immediate left, a concrete barrier wall rises, partially covered by green grass and rocks, while a metal guardrail runs along the right side of the road, backed by vibrant green trees and bushes. Further into the midground, a cluster of tall evergreen trees stands to the right of the road, with more lush forest covering the surrounding slopes, all set against a backdrop of distant, hazy blue mountains and a bright sky with scattered white clouds.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the road, causing the concrete barrier on the left and the guardrail/trees on the right to appear closer and pass out of frame. A series of red and white striped warning poles emerge from the distance on the right side of the road, steadily growing larger as they approach the viewer. The winding road ahead, alongside more of the forested mountain landscape, becomes progressively visible as the journey continues.
