The first frame displays a nighttime urban scene featuring a gathering of people on a paved sidewalk, with glass buildings and a tree adorned with string lights in the background. In the immediate foreground, the back of a person in a dark coat partially obscures another individual, while to their left, a Palestinian flag bearing "FREE PALESTINE" is visible amidst a crowd that includes uniformed personnel. To the mid-right, a person in a blue jacket holds a blue and white striped item, standing near a child in a grey jacket, and further right, a wooden bench on a concrete platform hosts a person wearing a blue and white striped scarf.

As the frames progress, the foreground person in the dark coat shifts leftward and eventually moves out of view, revealing more of the individual in an orange jacket directly behind them, holding an Israeli flag horizontally. This person subsequently rotates slightly to their right, becoming more completely visible from the back. Simultaneously, the person in the blue jacket to the right subtly adjusts their posture while continuing to hold the blue and white striped item. The child beside them remains largely stationary.
