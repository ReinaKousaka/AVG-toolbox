The first frame shows a wet city sidewalk stretching into the distance on the left, reflecting the ambient light, alongside a brightly lit store on the right with a long orange awning and large display windows revealing various shoes and a large poster on its back wall. Distant buildings with illuminated windows and a few pedestrians are visible down the street on the left under a dark blue night sky.
end of description
A person inside the brightly lit store, positioned left of the main entrance, begins walking towards the viewer. The store's automatic glass doors then start to slide open, revealing an "ASICS WALKING" sign now visible above the moving person, centered within the opening. The doors continue to open fully, and a second person becomes visible seated further inside the store to the right, while the first person remains near the fully open entrance.
