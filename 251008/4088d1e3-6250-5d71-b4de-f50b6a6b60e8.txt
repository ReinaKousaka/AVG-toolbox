A rainy street scene shows a white car bumper, ladder, and other items to the immediate left, with a banner, a washing machine, and a stool in front of a building's awning. A person stands under the awning. A wet brick sidewalk extends into the background, flanked by a prominent tree trunk and a parked car on the right, with street poles and more trees further along the road.

Throughout the frames, rain continues to fall steadily. A new person holding a white umbrella emerges from the far background right, slowly walking along the wet sidewalk towards the viewer.
