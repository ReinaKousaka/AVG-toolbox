The first frame displays a night street scene illuminated by numerous streetlights and building lights. In the immediate foreground, a dark vertical pole is visible on the far left, and a green public bin sits on the far right. A prominent white zebra crossing extends diagonally from the bottom-left foreground towards the mid-right. A group of approximately ten pedestrians are seen walking across this zebra crossing from left to right. In the mid-ground to the left, several cars are visible on the street, and in the background, multi-story buildings line both sides of the wide street, with one on the right appearing to be under construction, featuring barriers and a green pedestrian traffic light.

end of description
Throughout the frames, the group of pedestrians steadily moves across the zebra crossing from the viewer's left towards the viewer's right, progressing further into the mid-ground. Concurrently, vehicles on the street to the viewer's left continue to drive towards the right, passing behind the pedestrians relative to the first-frame viewpoint. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the dynamic changes consist solely of the movement of people and cars within the established environment.
