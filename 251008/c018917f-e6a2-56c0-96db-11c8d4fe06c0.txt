The first frame displays a vibrant city street at dusk, featuring three illuminated high-rise buildings directly in front of the viewer. To the far left, a multi-story building with an orange, yellow, and brown rhombus pattern stands next to a slimmer, light-colored building adorned with a large Patek Philippe watch advertisement at its upper section and a small tree at its base. To the right, a dark-facade building showcases multiple illuminated luxury brand displays, including Montblanc and Bvlgari, while a modern streetlight stands in the lower middle-right. An elevated traffic light displaying red is visible on the far left.

Following frames reveal the elevated traffic light transitioning from red to green to the left of the viewer. Vehicles, mainly black cars and taxis, emerge from the left and drive across the foreground street in front of the buildings, moving towards the right. Concurrently, pedestrians appear from the lower left, walking across the foreground on a crosswalk, also moving rightwards in front of the vehicles. The Montblanc store display on the right building and the Yamaha display on the left building's lower section show subtle changes in illumination and content as the scene brightens incrementally.
