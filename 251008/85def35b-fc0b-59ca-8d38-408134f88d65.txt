A curved road occupies the foreground, bordered by a metal guardrail extending to the right. To the left, a verdant, tree-covered hillside rises, while to the right, beyond the guardrail, a calm lake and a building with a red roof are visible alongside a directional road sign. Majestic snow-capped mountains dominate the distant background under an overcast sky.
end of description
As the viewer's vehicle advances around the left curve, a tunnel entrance becomes visible further left, previously hidden by the hillside and road. Simultaneously, the guardrail and the house on the right recede, revealing more of the blue lake to the right of its initial position, while distant mountains remain stable.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
A wet asphalt road, marked with white lines, curves gently to the left in the foreground. To the left, a steep dark rock embankment rises, topped by a dense forest of trees, while a metal guardrail runs along the right edge of the road, beyond which is a grassy verge leading to a lower area with buildings, a body of water, and snow-capped mountains in the distant right under an overcast sky. A red triangular deer crossing sign and several grey direction signs are positioned on the right side of the road.
end of description
The viewpoint moves forward, causing the wet road and the rock embankment on the left to appear closer. The deer crossing sign on the right approaches and then gradually moves past the viewer, as the distant mountains and water on the far right recede from view. The forested hillside ahead on the right becomes more prominent, revealing more of the winding road and a small tunnel entrance further down to the right.

In the first frame, a wet asphalt road with a broken white center line extends from the viewer, curving gently uphill to the right. To the immediate left is a steep, dark rocky embankment rising towards a forest of trees, while a silver metal guardrail runs along the right side of the road, beyond which lies green vegetation and some distant buildings partially obscured by trees. A triangular warning sign featuring a deer and text "↑ 2 km ↑" is positioned prominently on the right, beside the guardrail, with forested hills under an overcast sky forming the background.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the deer warning sign steadily recedes to the right and eventually exits the frame. The road ahead and the rocky embankment to the left become more prominent, appearing closer and revealing more of their length and detail. The guardrail on the right also moves past the viewer, while the distant landscape, including the forested hills, gradually appears to move further away relative to the foreground.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a two-lane asphalt road, appearing wet, curves gently to the right and extends into the mid-distance under an overcast sky. A steep, dark earthen and rocky embankment, sparsely vegetated, rises to the viewer's immediate left, while a metal guardrail runs along the road's right edge, bordering a drop-off. Beyond the guardrail, a tree-covered hillside ascends, featuring a prominent white-blossomed tree slightly left of the center.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the road, the immediate foreground (rocky embankment to the left, guardrail to the right) progressively recedes and passes the viewer. Concurrently, a lower road carrying vehicular traffic is gradually revealed below and to the right of the initial guardrail. More of the verdant hillside and trees to the left become visible further along the slope, while the distant curve and a tunnel-like structure ahead of the viewer steadily approach.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a gray asphalt road extending from the viewer's foreground into the mid-distance, curving slightly right and uphill, bordered by metal guardrails on both sides, under an overcast sky. To the left, a steep forested hillside with bare trees and green undergrowth rises, while a similar wooded slope with denser foliage is on the right, showing a distant structure below the guardrail. A cluster of white-blossomed trees is visible mid-slope on the left.

end of description

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the guardrails and immediate roadside scenery to recede into the distance relative to the initial position. The left hillside, previously visible, grows more prominent, revealing more of its steep, treed terrain and fallen logs. Concurrently, a small blue road sign, initially far ahead on the right side of the road, gradually becomes slightly clearer as the viewer approaches.
