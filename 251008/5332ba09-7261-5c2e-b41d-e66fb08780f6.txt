The first frame depicts a snow-covered path winding through a wintry landscape, bordered by pine trees and distant mountains under a cloudy sky. To the viewer's right, a multi-story white building with wooden balconies stands adjacent to a partially snow-covered dark gray car, while brown building roofs are visible below on the left. Several cross-country skiers are positioned further ahead on the path.
end of description.
As the viewpoint advances, the car moves out of frame to the right, revealing two yellow and blue striped poles and an orange flag to the right where the car was, while the building's name "seew" becomes visible on its facade. The skiers ahead become incrementally closer as the displayed distance marker updates from 10.9 km to 11.0 km.

In the first frame, a snow-covered path extends from the viewer into the midground, flanked by snow-dusted evergreen trees. To the left, a multi-story building and a smaller wooden building are visible amidst the trees, while to the right, two blue and yellow marker poles stand beside a snow-covered wooden fence. Three people are walking away from the viewer on the path ahead, with a dense, snow-covered forest and distant mountains filling the background under a cloudy sky.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the snow-covered path, causing the three individuals initially ahead to slowly recede further into the distance. The two blue and yellow marker poles, initially positioned to the right of the path in the midground, are passed and move towards the viewer's initial side and then behind the first-frame viewpoint. As the path ahead of the first-frame viewpoint is traversed, a new red and white striped barrier becomes visible extending across the right side of the path. Further details of the snow-covered wooden buildings to the left and the evergreen trees on both sides, previously partially obscured or distant, are progressively revealed as the viewer advances into what was previously the midground of the first frame.
