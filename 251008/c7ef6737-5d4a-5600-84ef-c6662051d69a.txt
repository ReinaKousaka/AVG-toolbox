The first frame shows a bustling city street. On the left, a sidewalk with pedestrians walking away from the viewer runs alongside a grand stone building with columns. Parked cars line the street to the right of the sidewalk, and a person stands by a dark SUV in the mid-foreground, facing away. In the background, tall skyscrapers with reflective windows rise, and the CN Tower is visible in the far distance to the left, beyond the street.

The camera slowly pans to the right, gradually shifting the scene. The CN Tower, initially in the far background-left, moves further left and eventually out of view. The large stone building on the left becomes less prominent as more of the street and the distant city buildings to the right become visible. The person near the dark SUV walks forward, eventually exiting the frame to the right. As the camera continues panning right, additional vehicles appear driving down the street in the mid-ground, further revealing the urban landscape beyond the initial parked cars.

In the first frame, a person in a black jacket and red pants walks away from the viewer, slightly right of center on a city sidewalk. To their right, the front-left portion of a silver SUV is prominently visible. To the left of the person, a dark utility pole with a blue 'CONNECT' banner and multiple signs stands over a yellow fire hydrant on the sidewalk. Further left, a wide sidewalk features several pedestrians walking away, bordered by bare trees and a grand stone building with classical architecture. The street in the midground has parked cars and moving traffic, leading towards a background dominated by numerous tall skyscrapers reflecting sunlight. A distant tower is visible on the far left horizon.
end of description
The person in the black jacket continues walking forward, moving away from the viewer and slightly towards the left side of the frame. As they move, the silver SUV to their right becomes slightly more fully visible on the right. Simultaneously, vehicles on the street in the midground, including a dark SUV, drive past, further away from the viewer. The pedestrians on the left sidewalk also continue their movement away from the viewer.

A city street scene shows a tall stone building on the left with a sidewalk, where people are walking. On the right, a street light pole with signs stands, and beyond it, a street with parked cars and modern buildings, several reflecting a golden light from the distant sun. In the immediate foreground, part of a silver car is to the viewer's far right, and a person in a black jacket and red pants stands near a yellow fire hydrant, facing away, next to a parked black car.

end of description

A person on a green bicycle appears from the right of the street light pole, cycling right and away from the viewer. Subsequently, the person in the black jacket begins walking left, moving past the yellow fire hydrant and further down the sidewalk relative to the viewer's initial position. Concurrently, the street light pole, originally near the center-right, slowly shifts towards the right edge of the frame, revealing more of the parked cars, including a new dark SUV appearing behind the black BMW on the street.
