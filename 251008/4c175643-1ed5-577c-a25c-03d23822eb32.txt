The first frame displays a street scene with buildings under a clear blue sky. To the left, a large, light-colored building with multiple windows and a rounded corner stands, with a cafe's outdoor seating area and a brown umbrella visible beneath it. Numerous pedestrians are scattered across the left sidewalk, moving away from the viewer. On the right, a multi-story modern building with many windows lines the street, which slopes slightly upwards and to the right. Bare trees with brown leaves are centrally located along the street, behind which are bright orange and red cargo container-like structures. In the mid-ground on the right, a tall pole with a blue 'P' parking sign is visible, and several blue bollards are along the right edge of the paved area closer to the viewer.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the static street and buildings remain unchanged while pedestrians move. People on the left sidewalk continue walking away from the viewer, while a person initially on the far right moves further right and out of the frame. A man in a blue jacket and jeans walks from the left sidewalk, crossing the street towards the right side of the scene. Another individual with a bag over their shoulder becomes more prominent on the left sidewalk, moving towards the cafe.

The first frame captures a lively urban street scene on a sunny day. To the left, a light-colored building with multiple windows and shops, including one marked "PERME," occupies the foreground, with a pole and blue parking sign in front of it. Numerous pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk and street in the left and central midground, past an outdoor caf√© with a large beige umbrella. Further down the street to the right, bare trees line the path, leading to stacked orange and grey containers on the right side, all under a bright blue sky.

Throughout the subsequent frames, pedestrians continually move across the foreground and midground of the street from left to right and further into the distance. The shadows cast by the buildings and trees subtly shift, indicating a slight passage of time.
