The first frame depicts a straight, paved road stretching into the distance under an overcast sky. To the viewer's left is a grassy median lined with large, lush green trees, behind which are parked cars and a few people sitting at picnic tables further down. To the viewer's right, a sidewalk runs alongside the road, featuring several houses; immediately adjacent is a light blue house, followed by a cream-colored building with a green roof, and further along, another cream-colored structure. Parked cars, including a grey Jeep and a red sedan, are visible along the right curb, with a utility pole and overhead wires also present on the right. In the far background, straight ahead, a city skyline with several tall buildings is visible.

The viewer moves forward along the road. The red sedan parked on the right side of the street gradually moves closer to the viewer and then out of the frame to the right, replaced by a black sedan advancing into the right foreground from further down the street. On the left, the picnic tables and initial groups of people recede and disappear behind the viewer as more of the tree-lined median and parked cars further down the road become visible. The light blue house on the right also moves further right, revealing more of the cream-colored building which was initially further down the street, while the distant city skyline in the background appears slightly nearer.

In the first frame, a wide street extends directly forward from the viewer. To the immediate right, a black car is partially visible, parked alongside a sidewalk with other parked cars and residential buildings, including a large yellow house further down. On the left, a large, dense green tree occupies the midground, with a grassy median and more parked cars behind it, beyond which distant city buildings are visible under an overcast sky.

As the viewpoint progresses forward along the street, the black car on the immediate right recedes to the right and out of view. More parked cars on the right-side sidewalk become visible and progressively closer, eventually replaced by a white SUV at the far right. Simultaneously, the large tree and grassy median on the left recede to the far left. A traffic light ahead turns red, and additional cars appear on the road, with some turning right, while the distant city skyline remains centrally visible in the background.

The first frame displays a street scene with a road extending into the distance towards a city skyline under a cloudy sky. To the left, a large tree with dense green foliage covers the upper quadrant, alongside a grassy median and a white van parked further down. On the right, a grey SUV is parked next to a light-colored house, with a prominent utility pole and power lines extending across the frame. In the distance, several cars are stopped at an intersection marked by two red traffic lights, with faint headlights visible on the far left.

end of description

A white SUV and a person briefly appear on the right sidewalk, behind the parked grey SUV, before disappearing. Subsequently, a white van emerges from the left side of the distant intersection, turning right onto the main road towards the viewer. As this van completes its turn and approaches, a tall, light-colored building on the far left, previously obscured by trees, becomes more visible. Simultaneously, the grey SUV parked on the right moves slightly forward, further down the road.
