The first frame displays a pedestrian street extending into the distance, bordered by buildings. On the left, a light-colored building features a prominent, square "ROLEX" clock sign hanging outwards, positioned above several visible storefronts. To the right, a darker building houses an outdoor cafe area with tables and chairs, shaded by trees with dark red foliage, with a street lamp standing in the mid-ground. The paved walkway leads towards the bright, distant end of the street where more buildings and a tree with yellow leaves are visible. Two people stand near the right-side cafe, while another person walks away in the distance, centered on the path.

Beginning from the second frame, a silver metal ladder gradually appears and becomes fully visible by frame five, leaning against the light-colored building on the left side of the street, positioned below the Rolex clock. Concurrently, the minute hand on the Rolex clock subtly advances clockwise, changing from approximately 10:10 in the first frame to roughly 10:15 by the final frame. No other significant objects are newly revealed or undergo dynamic changes; the people and the overall street scene remain largely stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame captures a paved pedestrian street flanked by buildings; a Rolex store with a clock is prominently on the immediate left, while a cafe with outdoor seating and trees occupies the right foreground. Down the street, more buildings are visible under a bright sky, with a group of people standing mid-right and a lone figure walking in the far distance.

Subsequently, the group of people on the mid-right disperses, and a woman in a dark coat begins walking away from the viewer down the street on the right side. She progresses further into the distance, becoming the primary moving figure as other individuals near the right foreground move out of view.
