The first frame captures a city street from a forward viewpoint, with a black van on the near left and a white van ahead in the center lane, delineated by concrete barriers and orange cones. Towering buildings line both sides of the street, one with reflecting windows on the right, where pedestrians walk, and another with scaffolding on the left; street signs like "E 47 St" and a "No U-turn" are also visible.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the black van exits the left frame and the white van moves forward, progressively revealing more vehicles in the mid-distance, including a new yellow taxi appearing from the left and another becoming more prominent on the far right. The overall cityscape recedes as the viewer progresses down the street.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a city street view with a yellow taxi on the far right foreground, a white van positioned directly ahead, and a black SUV to the left, partially obscured by concrete barriers with yellow markers. Tall, gridded buildings line the left side, while dark, glassy high-rises with two American flags on poles stand on the right, under a clear blue sky, with pedestrians visible on the far right sidewalk.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective advances steadily down the street. Consequently, the yellow taxi on the right and the black SUV on the left both move forward relative to the viewer, becoming more fully visible in the foreground. The white van directly ahead and the yellow van to its right also progress forward, maintaining their positions in front of the advancing viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
A yellow taxi is to the right of the viewer, slightly ahead, on a city street flanked by tall buildings. A white van drives directly ahead, with a concrete barrier separating the viewer's lane from traffic on the left, where a black SUV is visible. Numerous skyscrapers line both sides of the road under a clear sky.
end of description
The yellow taxi on the right and the white van ahead both advance forward relative to the viewer's fixed position. Concurrently, a second yellow taxi emerges from behind the first, further to the right, also moving forward as the scene progresses down the street.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a street view with a yellow taxi directly ahead, followed by a white van further down the lane. To the left, a concrete barrier separates traffic, beyond which are another yellow taxi and a black SUV. Skyscrapers flank both sides of the street, with a dark building on the right prominently featuring an American flag.
end of description
Over subsequent frames, the viewer's perspective advances, causing the yellow taxi ahead to recede further away, revealing more of the road directly in front. The concrete barrier to the viewer's left moves out of view, exposing more traffic lanes with additional cars and orange construction barriers appearing further ahead and to the left of the original barrier's position.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a city street scene from a low angle, with a yellow taxi directly in front of the viewer, followed by a white utility van further ahead in the same lane. To the viewer's immediate left, a concrete barrier and orange traffic cones separate the road from a sidewalk where pedestrians walk alongside tall, light-colored buildings; a black car is visible in the adjacent lane. To the right, a large dark building features an American flag prominently displayed, with pedestrians moving on the sidewalk below, near a dark trash can, another yellow taxi, and a green traffic light. Tall skyscrapers recede into the distance under a clear sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective slowly advances forward along the street. The black car to the left of the stationary yellow taxi gradually moves forward, eventually passing it, while other vehicles follow in that lane. Pedestrians on both sidewalks continue to walk, and the American flag subtly shifts on the building to the right.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a city street extends directly away from the viewer. To the left, a line of orange and white traffic cones marks a lane, with a dark SUV partially visible behind them, moving away. A yellow taxi is centrally positioned ahead of the viewer, also moving away. On the far left, a tall, light-colored building rises, while on the right, a dark skyscraper with vertical windows features an American flag hanging from it and a 'Capital One' sign visible on its ground floor. Overhead, a green traffic light hangs, and in the distance, more skyscrapers line the street under a clear sky.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly advances down the city street. The orange traffic cones on the left gradually move past the viewer, with the dark SUV further left also progressing forward and eventually exiting the frame. The yellow taxi ahead remains relatively centered, slowly moving away, while a large gray truck with a crane becomes visible further down the far left lane. The American flag and traffic light overhead, initially prominent on the right, slowly move upwards and out of the frame as the viewer continues forward. Buildings on both sides become more prominent, revealing more architectural details and storefronts as the scene unfolds.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A city street stretches forward, flanked by tall buildings. In the immediate foreground, orange and white traffic cones line the left side next to a concrete barrier, with a yellow taxi directly ahead in the center lane. Further down, other vehicles like a crane truck on the left and a white van are visible, while pedestrians walk on the right sidewalk next to a dark, vertically-striped building.
end of description
The viewpoint continuously moves forward. The initial cones and barrier recede and exit the foreground left, replaced by new concrete barriers and two silver cylindrical poles emerging from the bottom left. The yellow taxi ahead maintains its relative position, while other vehicles and pedestrians on the sidewalks recede or pass by as the urban scene progresses relative to the viewer's advancing position.
