A cobblestone square extends from the foreground, centering on a dark tiered fountain in the midground. To the left stands a pink building with an ivy-covered doorway and a white scooter parked beside it, while a brown stone building with colorful shutters and a decorated Christmas tree is to the right, adjacent to a white car parked on the far right.
