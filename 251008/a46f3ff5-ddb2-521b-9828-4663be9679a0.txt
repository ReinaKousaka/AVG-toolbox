The first frame displays a wet city street on an overcast day. A multi-story building with numerous windows and Korean signs, notably "압구정 파인만," forms a prominent corner at the center. Parked cars, including a dark SUV, line the street along this building, with a bright yellow bus parked immediately to the right of the SUV, marked by orange traffic cones. To the far left, a person under an umbrella walks away on the sidewalk. On the far right, a utility box, two trash bins, and a utility pole stand next to a crosswalk, with other buildings and greenery visible in the background.
end of description
The scene undergoes a subtle shift as the camera slowly pans to the right. The pedestrian on the far left gradually moves further away from the viewer and completely disappears from the frame by the second image. Concurrently, the utility pole and a bush with red flowers on the far right become more visible and closer to the first-frame viewpoint. The building on the far left recedes, while the street and buildings extending to the right of the first-frame's right edge are gradually revealed. The parked vehicles and the yellow bus remain stationary in the mid-ground throughout this panning motion.

The first frame displays a wet city street under an overcast sky. To the viewer's right foreground, a yellow utility pole with a pedestrian signal and three trash bins (two gray/orange, one gray/blue) are present, alongside a white utility box. A black SUV is parked on the left midground, with a yellow mini-bus parked slightly ahead of it, both on the left side of the wet road featuring a yellow and white crosswalk. On the left, a grey building with a red banner is visible, while green foliage with red flowers is seen to the right, behind the pole. A white car with headlights on is visible in the background, proceeding down the street.
end of description
The white car in the background begins to move slowly towards the viewer. It approaches and crosses the pedestrian crosswalk, passing the yellow mini-bus. The car continues forward, eventually turning right and exiting the frame to the viewer's immediate right.

The wet street in the mid-ground features a white and yellow crosswalk. To the left, a black SUV is partially visible in the foreground, with a yellow school bus parked behind it. On the right, a white utility box, three trash bins, and a yellow sign pole are in the foreground, backed by a brick wall and green trees with red flowers. Buildings line both sides of the street, receding into the distance, under a cloudy sky, with a white car positioned just before the crosswalk.
end of description
The white car, initially just before the mid-ground crosswalk, drives forward, moving progressively across the pedestrian crossing. It then continues to move away from the viewer, receding further down the street into the background until it is almost out of sight.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a wet street with a yellow and white crosswalk extends from the foreground into the midground. A yellow school bus is parked on the left foreground, while on the right, a light grey utility box, a green shared bicycle, and two orange/black trash bins are positioned beside a brick wall topped with lush greenery. In the midground, a white car approaches the crosswalk, with buildings lining the street on the left and more trees on the right, all under a cloudy sky.
end of description
The white car, initially approaching the crosswalk in the midground, steadily moves forward across the yellow and white stripes. It continues advancing towards the viewer, with its front end eventually passing the crosswalk and reaching near the level of the grey utility box on the right. No new objects are revealed as the car is the only dynamic element in the scene.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame features a white car in the foreground, angled slightly towards the viewer and positioned center-left on a wet street with faded yellow crosswalk markings. To its immediate left is a large yellow bus, partially visible. On the right, a brick wall topped with green bushes supports three stacked sacks, with a dark scooter parked near the bottom. The street recedes into the distance, flanked by multi-story buildings and utility poles under an overcast sky.
end of description
In the following frames, the white car and yellow bus both move forward and left, away from the viewer, progressively revealing orange traffic cones on the curb where the bus was initially positioned.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a wet city street under an overcast sky, with buildings lining both sides and a pedestrian crossing in the foreground. A yellow bus is parked to the left with orange traffic cones, while a brick wall topped with green bushes and several yellow sacks occupies the lower right.
end of description
In subsequent frames, a pedestrian signal post located on the right side of the street, beyond the brick wall and bushes, becomes active. Its lights transition from a purple glow (visible around frame 5) to an orange-red illumination (by frame 8).
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a wet city street under an overcast sky, with the view extending forward down the road. A yellow bus is partially visible on the far left, next to an orange and white barrier, with zebra crossing lines in the bottom foreground. On the right, a brick wall and green foliage are visible, along with a blue sign featuring an orange flashing light; buildings line both sides of the street, featuring parked cars and a distant dark van.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the yellow bus and the orange barrier move forward (away from the viewer and to the left), eventually leaving the frame. Concurrently, a person holding an umbrella emerges from behind the building on the left, proceeding forward along the sidewalk (away from the viewer).
