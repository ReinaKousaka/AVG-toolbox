The first frame displays a dark blue Range Rover SUV from the rear, parked centrally on a paved driveway. To the viewer's left and right, stone pillars flank the driveway entrance; the right pillar shows "9819 NEWHALL". Directly behind the vehicle, a large white two-story house with dormer windows stands, partially obscured by the SUV, with numerous trees and a bright blue sky completing the background.

As the frames progress, the Range Rover slowly backs away from the viewer, receding further down the paved driveway towards the white house. This movement makes the vehicle appear smaller and gradually reveals more of the driveway, the grassy areas on either side, and the expansive facade of the house relative to the initial viewpoint.
