The first frame displays a city street scene from a vehicle's perspective, centered on a white-striped crosswalk stretching directly ahead. Two dark cars are stationary immediately in front, with a silver car partially visible in the bottom right corner. Tall buildings line both sides of the street, extending into the background under a clear blue sky, interspersed with green-leafed trees.
end of description
The camera's viewpoint remains static throughout the subsequent frames, and the two dark cars directly ahead also stay stationary. However, traffic actively flows through the intersection to the right; a light blue car, initially visible in the mid-right portion of the intersection, steadily advances, becoming progressively closer and more prominent towards the viewer's foreground on the right side.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
A wide street scene on a clear day shows a central intersection ahead, with two black cars stopped in the foreground lanes and a light blue car on the far right. Tall, light-colored buildings line both sides of the street, with a large white billboard on the left and a building with 'ACCEA' signage on the right. Trees with green foliage are visible mid-ground, leading to more buildings in the distance under a blue sky, with a traffic light showing green.
end of description
The light blue car on the far right moves forward and eventually exits the frame to the right. A silver van then enters from the far right, moving forward into the space previously occupied by the blue car. Simultaneously, the two black cars positioned centrally and the white SUV on the right also begin moving forward, away from the viewer, while the pedestrian on the left continues walking further down the sidewalk.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a wide city street stretches forward from the viewer, occupied by dark asphalt with white lane markings and a crosswalk. To the right, a silver van is partially visible closest to the viewer, with several other cars behind it, some stopped at a green traffic light. To the left, a large white building with a blank billboard stands prominently, alongside a street lamp and trees lining the sidewalk. In the background, a mix of modern skyscrapers, including a tall white building and a blue-glass one, rise against a clear blue sky, with more urban buildings extending into the distance on both sides of the street.
end of description
A silver van on the right moves forward and exits the frame to the right, revealing a new silver car and subsequent vehicles, including a dark minivan, a dark sedan, and multiple SUVs, that appear from behind the original vehicles and drive forward past the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, cars in the central lanes also advance towards the viewer. On the far left, a pedestrian becomes visible walking forward along the sidewalk behind the lamp post, eventually moving out of view. All traffic lights remain green throughout the sequence.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a multi-lane city street with a crosswalk directly in front of the viewer. Ahead, a dark SUV is positioned to the right of the center, with a silver van beside it, and several other vehicles further down the road. Buildings line both sides of the street, including a tall white high-rise and a blue glass building in the distance, under a clear blue sky. A traffic light with green signals hangs overhead to the left, and trees with green leaves are visible on both sidewalks.

end of description

In subsequent frames, the black SUV on the right and the silver van beside it steadily advance forward and to the right, gradually exiting the frame from the right side. As these vehicles move away, a silver car previously obscured behind the silver van becomes more visible to the right. Concurrently, other vehicles further down the road also exhibit slight forward movement within their respective lanes.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays an urban street from a forward-moving perspective on a clear day, with a multi-lane asphalt road stretching ahead, flanked by buildings and trees on both sides. Several cars are visible in the mid-ground, including a silver minivan and a black van in the brown lane to the right, and other vehicles further down the left lane leading into the distant city skyline.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street, shifting the original objects closer or past the view. Yellow '50' speed limit markings, previously beyond the first-frame foreground, become visible on the asphalt road directly in front. A dark van, not fully visible in the first frame, appears on the far right lane, moving forward, while a pedestrian emerges onto the far left sidewalk from a position previously further ahead, walking towards the viewer's original location.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a city street leading into the distance under a bright blue sky, lined with buildings and trees on both sides. Ahead, three cars occupy the left lane moving away from the viewer, while a dark car and a white van approach in the right lane; a pedestrian walks on the left sidewalk away from the viewer.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the dark car in the right lane passes the viewer and recedes towards the background to the left of the initial viewpoint. The white van then follows, also passing the viewer and moving into the background on the left side of the original scene. Concurrently, the cars in the left lane and the pedestrian on the left sidewalk continue to advance further away into the distance relative to the first-frame position.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a city road stretching forward under a clear blue sky. In the left lane, a black car is positioned ahead of the viewer, while two parked white vehicles, a van and a sedan, are on the right side of the road. To the left, a sidewalk features trees, various buildings, a red mailbox, and street signs, including a '50' limit sign with an '8-20' time restriction. On the right, tall, striped buildings line the road with bare trees and streetlights.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the black car ahead maintains its relative position. The white van and sedan on the right begin moving forward and out of frame to the right, replaced by a scooter appearing from behind their initial position, also moving forward. The street signs on the left recede and vanish from the frame, revealing a new green traffic light further ahead on the left.
