The initial frame presents a wet, dark asphalt road at night, marked with yellow Korean characters for 'slow down' in the mid-ground. To the left, a partially visible striped pole and a white decorative fence atop a low wall line the road, while to the right, a wooden building with a '70' sign and bushes are visible. Heavy rain streaks down across the entire scene, illuminated by distant streetlights as the road curves gently uphill.

As the frames progress, the heavy rain continues to fall consistently. A blue plastic bottle appears further up the road, gradually floating and sliding closer towards the viewer, eventually entering the area of the yellow road markings.

In the first frame, a dark, wet asphalt road with prominent yellow lines runs from the foreground towards the background, featuring large yellow Korean characters painted on its surface. To the viewer's left, a white decorative railing fence runs alongside the road, backed by sparse vegetation, leading to a hazy, illuminated distant background. To the viewer's right, a darker, overgrown area with dense green foliage borders the road, giving way to buildings with lit windows further back. A utility pole stands slightly off-center to the right in the mid-ground, and the air is filled with visible raindrops under the night sky.
end of description
Subsequent frames show a continuous light rain falling, creating numerous small splashes and shimmering reflections on the wet road surface, particularly around the painted Korean characters which gradually recede further from the viewer as the camera subtly moves forward. No new objects are revealed; the scene maintains its original composition, with only the falling rain and minor viewpoint shift creating dynamic visual changes.

The first frame shows a dark, wet asphalt road stretching uphill and away from the viewer, marked with yellow double lines on both sides and large yellow Korean characters ("서행" - slow) in the foreground. To the viewer's left, a low concrete wall topped with a metal railing extends into the distance, with sparse greenery at its base. On the viewer's right, a dark building with a corrugated metal facade also recedes, its base similarly bordered by greenery. In the midground, a brightly lit streetlamp on a utility pole illuminates the road, while other buildings with glowing windows are visible further up the street, beyond the pole on the right.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, rain is visibly falling, causing constant reflections on the wet asphalt road. From frame 3, a large, light-colored vehicle, likely a bus or train, begins to emerge from the left, moving horizontally across the midground behind the railing on the road's left side. Its body fully traverses the view by frames 6-7, before its rear disappears off-frame to the right by frame 9. The overall scene and viewpoint remain static, consistently showing the rainy street with the vehicle's transient passage.
