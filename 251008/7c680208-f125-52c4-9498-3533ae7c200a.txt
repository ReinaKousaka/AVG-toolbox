The viewer is positioned on a wet, dark asphalt road, with a red shoulder strip visible on the right. Two dark cars with roof-mounted lights are positioned on the right side of the road ahead, with the closest one featuring a blue light and the slightly further one a yellow light. To the right of the road, a snow-covered bank features a dark guardrail, behind which a steep, rocky hillside covered in snow and retaining fences rises, topped by bare trees under an overcast sky. A prominent utility pole with traffic lights stands on the right, beside the hillside.

end of description

The viewer's vehicle moves forward, gradually overtaking the first car, which recedes from the midground to behind the viewer's position on the right. Subsequently, the second car is also passed, moving from the midground to behind the viewer. As the vehicle continues, a tiered concrete retaining wall and a bridge or tunnel entrance become visible on the left side of the road, previously hidden in the far background. The utility pole and initial guardrail on the right also recede behind the viewer.

The first frame displays a wet, snow-dusted road curving left, featuring a black taxi on the far right, an underpass with a bridge (and blue sign) on the left, and a steep, netted, snow-covered rocky embankment on the right, backed by snowy trees.
end of description
Subsequently, the black taxi moves forward and out of frame to the right. The viewer advances along the road, causing the underpass, bridge, and embankment to appear closer and shift progressively leftward within the frame relative to their initial positions.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a snow-dusted mountainous road scene. In the foreground, a wet, dark asphalt road curves slightly left, with red striped markings on its right edge and snow-covered ground and a guardrail on the left. An elevated bridge crosses the road ahead, supported by a concrete pillar near the center, with a blue road sign hanging beneath its left side and a street lamp arching over the road from the left. To the right, a tiered concrete retaining wall, partially snow-covered, rises alongside the road, backed by a steep, snow-covered mountainside with bare trees and a protective mesh.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly advances along the road. A white car becomes visible, emerging from the tunnel opening beneath the bridge and moving towards the viewer. It continues to approach, passing beneath the bridge's left arch. The car then proceeds further down the road, drifting towards the left and slightly away from the original first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a wet, snow-lined road leading towards an underpass topped by an overpass with a blue directional sign ahead. To the left, a guardrail, lamppost, and two circular traffic signs are visible, with snow-covered mountains and trees forming the backdrop.
end of description
As the viewer progresses, the road, underpass, and accompanying signs steadily approach and enlarge, moving slightly higher in the frame, indicating forward motion towards the tunnel entrance visible ahead in the initial view.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The viewer is positioned on a wet asphalt road, with snow-covered shoulders and a guardrail on the left. An overhead concrete structure spans the road, supporting a blue directional sign and two regulatory signs (40 km/h speed limit, no passing) to the upper left. Beyond this structure, the road curves slightly to the right, flanked by snow-covered trees and a steep rocky incline on the right, with another distant tunnel entrance visible further down the road. Snow-dusted mountains and bare trees rise in the background under an overcast sky.
end of description
The camera moves forward, passing under the overhead concrete structure, which progressively moves above and behind the viewer. The road signs on the left and the blue overhead sign move out of view to the upper left, while the concrete pillars supporting the structure become more prominent and then recede to the left. A white car appears in the distance on the curved road ahead, slowly moving closer towards the viewer, passing under a black electronic sign to the left. The distant tunnel entrance and the surrounding snowy landscape continually grow larger as the viewpoint advances.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The viewer is looking out from under a concrete overpass onto a snow-covered mountain road, which curves right, with a white car in the midground and an electronic sign post on the left. Snowy mountains and trees line both sides of the road in the distance, while a barrier and retaining wall are visible to the right.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the overhead concrete structure above the viewer gradually recedes upwards and the viewpoint appears to move forward into the scene. The white car, initially in the midground, approaches the viewer, becoming larger in the foreground. It then passes the initial first-frame viewpoint and exits the frame to the right, revealing more of the road and the snowy right-hand embankment. The scene further reveals additional snowy trees on the left mountain slope and a more distinct view of the mountains in the far background.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
A snow-covered, winding road stretches ahead from the viewer's position. To the immediate left is a snowy shoulder bordered by a white guardrail, while a white car is partially visible on the far right shoulder, positioned next to dark square barriers. A steep, snow-laden mountain slope with numerous trees and a dark fence-like structure rises prominently on the right. In the mid-distance, a street lamp stands on the left, and a brown sign with yellow caution signs is mounted on a pole on the right, all set against a backdrop of distant, snow-covered mountains and an overcast sky.
end of description
The viewpoint moves forward along the winding road. The white car, initially on the far right, recedes and moves out of frame to the right and behind the initial viewpoint. Objects like the street lamp and the brown sign, initially ahead, move closer and then pass to the viewer's sides and eventually behind the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, new sections of the snowy road and the mountainous scenery further ahead are progressively revealed. A dark vehicle becomes visible in the far distance, appearing around a bend on the road to the left of the original viewpoint.
