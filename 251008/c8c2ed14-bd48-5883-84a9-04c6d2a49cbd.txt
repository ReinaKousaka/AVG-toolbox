In the first frame, a woman's torso and arm are visible in the foreground to the right, moving out of view, while a light green electric scooter is partially visible in the foreground to the left. A dirt path extends into the midground, bordered by grass and water on the left, and a metal construction fence on the right, behind which are several buildings and trees under a clear blue sky. end of description.
As frames progress, the woman and scooter move completely out of view. A yellow and black sign on the fence to the right of the path becomes fully visible, then also exits the frame as the viewpoint moves slightly forward. A pile of gravel behind the fence and to the right of the path is revealed.

A dirt path extends from the foreground center towards a light-colored building with two dark garage doors in the mid-ground. Green grass and scattered rocks border the path, with a narrow waterway and a small concrete structure visible to the far left. On the far right, a temporary metal construction fence runs from the foreground towards another light-colored building and a green shed-like structure in the mid-ground. Tall green trees and smaller bushes are positioned around the buildings, with a clear blue sky dominating the background, and distant land visible over the waterway to the left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer slowly moves forward along the dirt path. The metal construction fence on the right side of the frame gradually recedes and moves slightly out of view as the viewer advances. Concurrently, the buildings and trees in the mid-ground, previously directly ahead, are subtly approached, appearing marginally larger within the frame as the perspective shifts forward.

In the first frame, a dirt path occupies the center foreground, extending into the midground. Green grass borders the path on both sides. To the left, a narrow canal with a small wooden structure is visible in the foreground, leading to a grassy bank with tall green trees further back. To the right, a tall chain-link fence runs from the mid-right foreground towards the background, partially obscuring a light-colored building and a green-leafed tree. At the end of the path in the background, a building with two garage-like doors is visible, surrounded by trees including a prominent light-leafed deciduous tree. A clear blue sky is overhead.
end of description
The camera moves forward along the dirt path. The chain-link fence on the right gradually recedes from the immediate foreground, revealing more of the light-colored building and a green container positioned to the right of the path relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the canal and wooden structure on the left also recede from the viewer's immediate left. The building with garage doors at the end of the path appears slightly closer as the viewpoint progresses forward.
