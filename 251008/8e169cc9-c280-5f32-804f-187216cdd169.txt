The first frame displays a city sidewalk extending forward, with a green stepladder resting against a dark storefront on the left, beneath a striped awning. In the foreground right, a grey pole stands with a small red object at its base, while scaffolding rises from the mid-ground center. Beyond the scaffolding, a graffiti-covered storefront and an ornate building line the street, where a parking meter is visible mid-right and a lone pedestrian walks away into the distant right.
end of description
The viewer's perspective gradually shifts forward and slightly right, continuously revealing more of the distant street and buildings. A new group of pedestrians, including someone pushing a stroller, subsequently appears from the right mid-ground, moving further away down the sidewalk into the distance, as the initial lone pedestrian disappears from view.
