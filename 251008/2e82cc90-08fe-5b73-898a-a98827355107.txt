The first frame captures a city street at dusk, with a tall, modern glass building dominating the right and central background. In the midground, to the left, is a building housing illuminated storefronts, including "Brioche Dorée" with a red awning and a bright café above it featuring many windows. A dark lamppost with blue and white lights is partially visible in the far left foreground. Numerous pedestrians are seen walking away from the viewer on the paved sidewalk in the midground and background, stretching towards the right.
end of description
The camera slowly pans to the right and moves forward, gradually revealing a row of small trees in planters along the right side of the sidewalk. The lamppost seen in the first frame moves out of view to the far left. As the viewpoint advances, more pedestrians become visible further down the sidewalk, continuing to walk away from the initial position. The large glass building in the background appears larger and shifts slightly more towards the center of the frame.
