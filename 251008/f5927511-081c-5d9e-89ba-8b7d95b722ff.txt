The first frame depicts a large, light-colored stone building occupying the mid-right to far right, featuring dark gridded windows and a prominent ornate dark door structure. A low stone wall with a lighter sidewalk runs in front of the building, while a partial green structure is visible on the far left. To the left of the building, a large tree stands, behind which a pole with multiple security cameras overlooks a distant street scene with vehicles.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly shifts slightly right. A man on a scooter enters from the far left, moving towards the right side of the viewer's current field of vision, becoming increasingly prominent in the foreground. In the background, further to the left of the tree from the initial viewpoint, additional people become visible near the street.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
In the first frame, the upper body of a man is visible at the bottom center. To the man's left, a vertical strip of bright green artificial foliage appears. Behind him, a concrete wall extends horizontally, with a large tree featuring green leaves and multiple white security cameras mounted on a pole near its trunk slightly to the left. To the right, a grand stone building with windows, grates, and columns dominates the midground, while a street with people and vehicles is visible in the background to the left.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the man in the bottom foreground progressively moves downward and out of the scene. By the second frame, only his head is visible, and by the third, he is almost entirely gone, with just the very top of his head visible at the bottom edge. From the fourth frame onward, the man has completely exited the view from below. All other objects and their spatial positions, including the building, tree, cameras, and street, remain static relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a concrete barrier wall extends from the lower right towards the center, revealing a sidewalk to its left. Centrally positioned, a tree with a thick trunk and lush green foliage is partially obscured by a white pole with security cameras attached, extending from a building on the right. This light-colored stone building, featuring classical columns, decorative friezes, and windows with grates, rises along the right side of the frame, with a set of stairs leading to its entrance. To the left, a large green construction barrier with white Chinese text stands, behind which a street with vehicles and pedestrians is visible, extending into the background.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly moves forward and slightly to the left. The concrete barrier on the right recedes, revealing more of the sidewalk directly in front and shifting the tree further right relative to the frame's center. Concurrently, more of the stone building's facade, including additional windows and the base of its columns, becomes visible to the right of the initial view. The green construction barrier on the far left moves out of frame, exposing more of the street and background beyond it. A pedestrian, initially partially visible behind the central barrier, walks further along the sidewalk to the left and away from the viewer.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, a large tree trunk is prominently positioned to the viewer's immediate right, with its dense green canopy overhead. To the right of the tree, a grand white building with columns and steps extends into the background. Along the center and right mid-ground, a row of gray concrete blocks borders a sidewalk where a person on a yellow bicycle and other pedestrians are visible moving away from the viewer. To the left, a tall green fence with white Chinese characters runs parallel to the sidewalk, and in the far background, a street with vehicles and more trees is visible.
end of description
The bicyclist and other pedestrians move progressively further away from the viewer along the sidewalk. As they move, a large lion statue on a pedestal is fully revealed to the right of the sidewalk in the mid-ground, previously partially obscured. Subsequently, a second smaller lion statue and its pedestal, located further right and slightly behind the first, become visible to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a man on a yellow bicycle is in the foreground-left, riding towards the viewer's right past a tall green construction barrier on his immediate left. To the viewer's right, a large classical stone building with columns and stairs borders a sidewalk extending into the background, where a lion statue, several pedestrians, and distant city elements are visible beneath green trees overhead.
end of description
The cyclist continues moving towards the right, eventually leaving the foreground view. Simultaneously, the pedestrians further along the sidewalk recede deeper into the distant background, and a dark car emerges from the mid-background street, driving from left to right past them, all while the camera's first-frame viewpoint remains fixed.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a street scene featuring a grand columned building on the right, steps leading up to it, and a green construction barrier on the left. In the foreground right, a lion statue rests on a stone base, facing away from the viewer, while two people walk on the sidewalk in the midground center-left, with trees and a street beyond.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the lion statue slowly rotates counter-clockwise on its base, progressively revealing its left flank and face to the viewer, with all other objects remaining static relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a large dark lion statue rests in the immediate foreground to the viewer's right. Along the far left, a tall green fence borders a paved sidewalk where two individuals walk away towards the center-left. Further along the street in the mid-ground, a gray car is parked, with more vehicles and buildings visible beyond it. To the right in the background, a large building with columns and steps rises, flanked by several green trees.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the two individuals on the sidewalk consistently move further away from the viewer, proceeding towards the left side of the frame.
