The first frame presents a snowy night scene featuring a row of residential buildings. In the foreground, a snow-covered metal railing stretches across the bottom, with two bare trees, heavily laden with snow, positioned to the left and slightly right of center. Behind these, a series of brownstone buildings with illuminated windows stand in the midground, their front steps also covered in snow; a round red sign is visible in front of the central building. To the far right, a taller, lighter-colored building is partially visible in the background.

The camera slowly pans right and slightly zooms out, causing the foreground railing and snow-covered trees to shift left relative to the buildings, revealing more of the scene to the right. This gradual movement exposes additional windows and architectural details of the brownstone buildings on the right side. The taller, lighter building initially on the far right becomes more fully visible as the overall streetscape widens.

In the first frame, a nighttime street scene is dominated by three multi-story brick row houses across the midground, with their snow-dusted front steps leading up to dark doors. To the far left, a snow-covered tree stands, mirroring a smaller, similarly coated tree in front of the rightmost house. In the foreground, a dark fence runs horizontally, behind which a line of snow-covered bicycles is partially visible, while a 'No Parking' sign is centrally located in front of the middle house, slightly to its right. A taller, darker building is visible to the far right.

Throughout the subsequent frames, heavy snowfall intensifies, progressively accumulating on all visible surfaces. The ground and the row of bicycles in the foreground become significantly thicker with fresh snow, obscuring more of their underlying details. The branches of both trees, positioned to the left and right in the midground, also gather a visibly denser layer of white snow.
