In the first frame, a winding asphalt road curves to the right, with two white cars positioned in the mid-right, ahead of the viewer. To the immediate left, beige concrete barriers topped with an orange construction fence line the road. Beyond the road, lush, terraced green hills rise on both sides, featuring scattered palm trees and a cluster of white buildings with red roofs on the left slope. Utility poles and wires span the upper part of the frame against a cloudy sky.

As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective subtly shifts forward. The two white cars, initially ahead, move slightly further down the road. Concurrently, a "no pedestrians" sign becomes fully visible on the left side, attached to the orange fence. Further ahead on the right, more parked vehicles become discernible down the road.

In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a winding road with a white Citroen C3 car ahead and to the right, and another white vehicle partially visible in the immediate foreground on the right. To the left, a concrete barrier topped with orange construction netting lines the roadside, behind which a steep, terraced hillside covered in green vegetation, palm trees, and scattered white buildings extends into the distance. A utility pole with power lines runs across the upper-mid section of the frame, and a cloudy sky covers the upper background.

As the frames progress, a large, rectangular information sign mounted on a pole to the left of the road, behind the yellow temporary barriers and orange cone, gradually slides into full view from the right. This blue-toned sign, initially partially obscured, becomes more prominent. Simultaneously, the cars in front of the viewer and further down the road slowly advance forward.
