In the first frame, a wet, brick-paved pedestrian street extends into the distance, with two individuals holding open umbrellas walking away from the viewer on the left. Towards the center-midground, a grey kiosk with a blue scooter parked beside it is visible, while a slender tree and a street lamp stand to the right. Along the left are modern storefronts with black facades, and to the right, a brick building houses more shops, including one with a yellow 'CAFE GA' sign. Distant buildings are visible in the far background under an overcast sky.

The two individuals with umbrellas gradually walk further away from the viewer, moving from the mid-left side of the street towards the far-left background. They continue to recede into the distance before walking out of the frame entirely on the left side. No new objects or scenes are revealed.

The first frame shows a wet, brick-paved urban street extending away from the viewer. To the viewer's immediate left, a row of storefronts like 'THE FACE' lines the street. To the viewer's immediate right, brick-faced buildings with shops like 'IMAN' are visible, with a small tree and a silver pole in the foreground. In the midground, slightly left of center, stands a light gray kiosk with a teal scooter leaning against it, with a green kiosk further back to its right. Beyond these, the street recedes into a bustling commercial area with multiple buildings, illuminated signs, and a large, modern curved structure in the distant background.

The camera executes a slow, continuous pan to the right. This motion gradually shifts the left-side storefronts and central kiosks leftward within the frame, revealing more of the brick-faced buildings and street scene previously to the viewer's right. Between frames 3 and 5, a dark car briefly appears moving right in the distant street, behind the midground kiosks, before exiting the frame to the viewer's right. The tree in the foreground on the right also moves left relative to the frame, exposing more of the street and right-side storefronts that were initially just out of view.

The viewer faces a wet, paved pedestrian street in a bustling commercial district under an overcast sky. To the immediate left stands a light-colored kiosk-like structure, with a blue electric scooter parked next to its front. On the right, a building features a brick facade near the viewer and darker storefronts further down the street, adorned with string lights on a tree branch near the top right. Further down the street, in the midground, another smaller kiosk with a yellow roof sign is visible to the left, while an escalator ascends on the right. Various multi-story buildings with numerous signs line both sides of the street, and in the distant background, a large building with a distinctive curved roof and a tall metal tower structure rises.

From the second frame onwards, subtle ripples and splashes begin to appear across the puddles on the wet pavement directly in front of the viewer. These ripples gradually intensify and become more widespread in subsequent frames, animating the water's surface and indicating continuous rainfall throughout the sequence.
