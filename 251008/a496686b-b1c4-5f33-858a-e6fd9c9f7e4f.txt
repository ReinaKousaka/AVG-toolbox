The first frame displays a rural landscape under a cloudy sky, featuring a wooden building with a chimney and a person on the left, a red car parked beside a light-colored house on the right, and a paved road curving towards grassy fields, scattered houses, and distant mountains in the background.

As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the person on the left quickly disappears, and the wooden building recedes to the left. A grey metal fence then emerges from the left foreground, gradually obscuring the lower part of the receding building and extending into the mid-ground. Concurrently, the red car on the right becomes more fully visible from its rear as the viewpoint passes its front, and the road ahead becomes clearer.

A paved road curves slightly right in the foreground, with a modern house and grey fence on the left, and sparse vegetation on the right. In the midground, large evergreen and deciduous trees stand beside the road, beyond which a green field extends to distant houses, including one with a red roof. Mountains loom in the background under a cloudy, overcast sky.

As the viewer moves forward along the road, the house and fence on the left recede, revealing more of a village area with multiple buildings and parked cars *ahead and to the left*. The vegetation and first road marker on the right also recede, making the green field and houses *further ahead* more prominent. A manhole cover appears on the road *directly in front of the viewer* and then passes, while a second road marker becomes visible *further ahead on the right*.
