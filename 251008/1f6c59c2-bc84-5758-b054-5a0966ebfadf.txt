In the first frame, a snow-covered urban park scene is visible. Centrally, a dark, abstract bronze sculpture of two figures stands on a pedestal, surrounded by snow-dusted ground and low hedges in the foreground. Behind the sculpture, to the right, a trash can and a red bench are partially covered in snow, while bare trees laden with snow are seen to the left and center. A tall, light-colored building with numerous windows dominates the background to the left and center, with a darker modern building partially visible on the far right. Snow is gently falling across the scene.

end of description

As the frames progress, the snowfall intensifies, with individual flakes becoming more distinct and visible throughout the air. Concurrently, the camera appears to very subtly zoom out or pan slightly to the left, revealing marginally more of the snow-covered ground and a hint more of the yellow-green foliage situated further to the left of the bare trees, all relative to the initial viewpoint.
