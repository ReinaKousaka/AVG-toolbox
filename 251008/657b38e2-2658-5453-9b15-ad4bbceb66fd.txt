At a bustling night market, three brightly lit market stalls with red roofs are visible across the mid-ground. The leftmost stall features a person in a blue uniform and displays various items, with a golden star decoration positioned to its right. The central stall, adorned with a wreath and a small tree-like decoration on its roof, also displays merchandise, and a golden star is to its right. The rightmost stall is richly decorated with green garlands and numerous hanging golden ornaments. Strings of warm fairy lights stretch across the dark night sky in the upper frame, illuminating the scene where several people walk and stand in the foreground and mid-ground.
end of description
Throughout the frames, people in the foreground and mid-ground continuously move, primarily from left to right, altering their positions relative to the stationary market stalls. This movement reveals and re-obscures parts of the stall interiors and display items that were initially partially hidden. By the later frames, a previously partially obscured "Chimney Cake" sign above the rightmost stall becomes distinctly clearer and more visible. A larger group of people also congregates in front of this particular stall, indicating increased activity.
