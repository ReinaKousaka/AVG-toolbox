To the viewer's immediate left, mannequins wearing winter clothing are displayed behind a reflective store window, which also shows reflections of the snowy street and buildings opposite. A long row of glass storefronts extends into the midground on the left, bordering a snow-covered sidewalk that recedes centrally. To the right in the midground, a bus stop shelter with a 'Spirited' movie poster stands beside a snow-covered trash can, with a snowy street and distant buildings beyond it.

The viewpoint shifts horizontally to the right, progressively revealing more of the store's interior display to the left of the initial mannequins. A new mannequin in a white coat appears on the far left, followed by shelves holding boots and various light-colored garments on hangers within the store window. The bus stop and street on the right side of the frame maintain their initial spatial positions relative to the viewer.

The first frame captures a snowy urban street view, with a glass storefront displaying hanging clothes in light colors on the viewer's immediate left. On the viewer's immediate right, a bus stop shelter features a large illuminated poster for the movie "Spirited." A snow-covered sidewalk stretches into the distance between these two structures, bordered by a street with moving cars and reflections of city buildings in the storefront glass. Bare trees and distant buildings are visible under an overcast sky further down the road.

The camera gradually pans to the left, revealing more of the storefront window beyond the initial view. A mannequin, dressed in dark clothing with a pink-lit head, emerges into view on the far left inside the storefront, becoming increasingly visible across the frames. Simultaneously, the bus stop on the right remains in its position but occupies a slightly smaller portion of the expanding frame, while vehicles on the street in the midground subtly shift their positions.

In the first frame, a snow-covered city sidewalk extends into the distance, flanked by a modern building with large reflective windows on the left and a glass bus stop shelter on the right. On the far left, the upper part of a mannequin in a patterned garment is visible within the shop window, while the bus stop shelter on the right features a green advertisement and a visible bench inside. Reflected cars and buildings appear on the left windows, and more cars and distant buildings are visible on the street beyond the bus stop shelter.
end of description
The camera slowly pans right, revealing more of the street ahead and the interior of the shop to the left. The mannequin moves out of view to the left, and the advertisement on the bus stop shelter moves out of view to the right, with a white SUV appearing on the street beyond the shelter and moving further right relative to the initial viewpoint.

From inside a bus shelter, a snow-covered city street extends forward, bordered on the left by a long glass storefront reflecting the urban environment and displaying colorful clothing, and on the right by the bus shelter's glass panels and bench; a snowy sidewalk with visible tracks leads past bare trees towards distant buildings and moving vehicles with illuminated headlights under an overcast sky.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly shifts slightly forward and right. The reflections in the left storefront morph, progressively revealing more of the vibrant red and yellow clothing within the store. Simultaneously, vehicles on the snow-covered street continue moving away into the distance, appearing further from the initial viewpoint. A person appears on the far sidewalk, walking further away from the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a snowy urban street view, featuring a glass building facade on the left reflecting cars and displaying a pink-clad mannequin inside, while a snow-covered sidewalk and a bare tree run through the midground. To the right, a snowy street with distant cars moves away from the viewer, bordered by buildings and a street sign in the background, all partially enclosed by a bus shelter structure on the far right.
end of description
Subsequently, an icicle hanging from the building overhang to the left of the bare tree begins to drip, becoming more pronounced over time. A dark car on the street, initially in the mid-ground right, slowly advances toward the foreground, driving away from the viewer. Meanwhile, a pedestrian emerges on the far sidewalk, to the right of the moving traffic, walking further into the distance.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a snowy urban street with a prominent glass storefront featuring mannequins on the left, reflecting the surroundings, while a snow-covered sidewalk extends into the distance beside a bare tree. To the right, a snowy road carries several vehicles, including a black car close to the viewer, with multi-story buildings and traffic lights visible further down the street.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the black car on the right moves away from the viewer along the street, progressively disappearing. Other vehicles and pedestrians on the distant sidewalk also continue moving further away, as a dark SUV enters the scene from the right and follows suit.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a snowy city street scene. To the immediate left, a large glass storefront displays several mannequins dressed in various outfits, reflecting the urban environment. A snow-covered sidewalk stretches from the viewer towards the background, bordered on the right by a bare, snow-dusted tree. Further right, a road with a mix of snow and slush features cars driving away from the viewer, leading to an intersection marked by traffic lights and a "Robson St" sign. Tall buildings line both sides of the street in the background, also dusted with snow. A pedestrian with a red suitcase is visible walking away on the sidewalk in the midground.
end of description
In the following frames, the silver SUV and the black car on the street steadily move further away from the viewer. Simultaneously, the pedestrian with the red suitcase on the sidewalk also continues walking into the distance, progressing away from the first-frame viewpoint. The traffic light at the Robson Street intersection changes from green to amber, then to red.
