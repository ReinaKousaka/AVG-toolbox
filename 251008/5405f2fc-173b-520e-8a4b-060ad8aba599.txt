In the first frame, a tall, cylindrical advertising column stands prominently in the right foreground, displaying various illuminated posters, including one with an angry emoji and another featuring "LOST FREQUENCIES." To its left is a paved pedestrian area with several wooden benches, trees, and streetlights, while a large illuminated billboard is visible on a building further left in the background. To the right of the column, a street with visible car headlights stretches into the distance, bordered by a row of multi-story city buildings with many illuminated windows.

The camera slowly pans to the left, causing the cylindrical advertising column to shift from the right foreground towards the center-right and revealing more of the pedestrian area to its left. As the pan continues, the first-frame viewpoint expands further left, revealing more of the street and buildings on the right side of the main road, while the initial large billboard in the background-left becomes more centrally positioned. The overall scene widens to expose more distant elements of the city street and architecture.

The first frame depicts a night city scene from a low-angle viewpoint on a paved sidewalk, featuring a wooden bench in the bottom left foreground and a similar bench structure centrally, with small shrubs and three dark vertical panels to the immediate right. To the left of the viewer is a pedestrian area with trees, streetlights, multiple benches, and several pedestrians, overlooked by a building with a large illuminated billboard. To the right, a multi-lane road extends into the distance, with numerous vehicles and bright headlights, flanked by illuminated buildings under a dark sky.

The camera subtly pans to the right, gradually revealing more of the street and the buildings located further to the right of the initial view. Concurrently, vehicles on the multi-lane road continue to move, with several cars approaching the viewer and their headlights brightening. As the viewpoint shifts, pedestrians on the left side of the street change positions, and a bicycle initially parked in the mid-ground moves out of the frame.

The first frame displays a night city scene with a paved pedestrian area in the foreground featuring two dark bollards on the left and a modern wooden bench and small garden bed on the right. To the mid-left, a tree-lined promenade hosts several benches with people seated, and a bicycle parked upright. Across the midground, a busy street with illuminated vehicles moves from right to left, flanked by multi-story buildings with visible lights and a prominent tall modern streetlight on the right.

A light-colored SUV with bright headlights enters the midground road from the right side of the first-frame viewpoint, driving leftward past the tall streetlight. It continues moving left, eventually passing out of view, followed by another darker vehicle further behind it.
