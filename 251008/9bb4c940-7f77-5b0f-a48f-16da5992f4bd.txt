In the first frame, a paved sidewalk occupies the foreground, leading towards a street with a pedestrian crossing marked by white stripes in the mid-ground. To the left, numerous bicycles are parked along the street in front of a modern building with lighted windows; a dark SUV is stopped on the pedestrian crossing. To the right, another paved sidewalk features bare trees and outdoor seating for a glass-fronted building, also illuminated from within. In the far background, distant tall buildings are visible under an overcast sky.
end of description
The dark SUV in the mid-ground remains stationary on the pedestrian crossing for several frames. From frame 6, a dark blue car enters from the far left, moving across the street towards the right, passing the stationary SUV. This blue car continues to move past the first-frame viewpoint, progressively appearing closer to the viewer and further to the right across the road in subsequent frames, eventually exiting the scene to the right.
