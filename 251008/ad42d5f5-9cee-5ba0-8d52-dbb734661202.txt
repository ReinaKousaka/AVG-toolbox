As the scene progresses, the person in the foreground moves left and exits the frame, revealing more of a brick wall and a fence on the far left. Snow begins to fall across the street, and a figure in a black puffer jacket approaches the foreground from the mid-ground on the right side of the alley, while other pedestrians continue walking further into the background.

The first frame shows a narrow, wet alleyway at night with snow falling. A person in a black hooded jacket walks towards the viewer on the right foreground, partially visible. Further down the alley, a group of people walks away, passing buildings with illuminated signs, including a French flag, on both sides, with a building featuring a "KIMON" sign on the left.
end of description
Subsequently, the foreground person moves entirely out of the frame to the right, revealing more of the right-side building and wet pavement. Concurrently, the group of people in the mid-ground continues moving deeper into the alley, further away from the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame depicts a narrow, wet street at night with snowflakes falling. Several pedestrians walk away from the viewer: two people arm-in-arm are on the left side of the path, two individuals holding umbrellas are in the center-right, and another person is visible further back in the center. Buildings with illuminated signs line both sides, and an outdoor staircase is situated on the far right. end of description.
As frames progress, the pedestrians continue moving away from the viewer; the pair on the far left moves progressively out of frame to the left, while the umbrella users move slightly closer to the viewer. The falling snow intensifies throughout the sequence, becoming more noticeable on the closer figures.

In the first frame, two partially obscured individuals holding a dark umbrella are positioned in the immediate foreground, to the right of the viewer, walking from left to right. To the left and slightly further back, a person in a green coat holds a clear umbrella and walks towards the viewer on a wet, reflective sidewalk. Buildings with large glass windows and signs like "SOUP NOODLE" and "MOO LEE" line the left side of the street, extending into the midground. In the deeper background, another figure is visible, and to the far right, stairs ascend alongside an illuminated building facade. Snow or rain is visibly falling across the scene.
end of description
The two foreground figures quickly pass out of view to the right, revealing more of the wet sidewalk and the building facade with stairs to the immediate right of the first-frame viewpoint. The person in the green coat and clear umbrella walks progressively closer to the viewer, eventually also passing out of frame to the right, fully exposing the narrow street ahead. As they depart, previously obscured storefronts with glowing signs, including one for "Vape Studio," and upper-story residential buildings further down the lane become clearly visible in the midground and background, directly ahead of the original viewpoint. The falling precipitation continues throughout the sequence.

The first frame displays a dark, rainy urban street or alley at night. The wet, reflective ground stretches directly in front of the viewer, sloping gently upwards and featuring a rectangular metal grate in the mid-foreground. To the left, a building with several glass storefronts, one displaying "NOO LEE" and "how to order," extends into the distance. On the right, another building with an "ORGANIC" sign and a raised entrance is visible. In the mid-ground, a person holding an umbrella walks away from the viewer, passing a tall dark pole and heading towards a brightly lit "vape studio" storefront further down the street on the right. Additional buildings and faint lights are in the background under the overcast sky.
end of description
The initial person holding an umbrella walks further away into the distance. A second person emerges to their left, behind them, also walking away from the viewer deeper into the alley. Subsequently, a third individual appears even further left and behind the second person, moving in the same direction, all while the rain continues to fall.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A narrow, wet street stretches into the distance, flanked by buildings. On the left, a cafe with large windows reflects light, while on the right, an "ORGANIC" store and a "vape studio" are visible. Three people walk away from the viewer towards the distant vape studio, with one holding an umbrella in the foreground.
end of description
The people continue walking further away, as heavy snowfall begins and intensifies across the scene, visible in the air and accumulating on surfaces not present in the initial frame. The individual in the yellow jacket, initially mid-ground, moves forward past the left side. A large poster on the left building gradually reveals a person's yelling face. Two additional people with umbrellas emerge from the background, walking closer to the viewer through the same path.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a snowy city street at night, featuring a large billboard on the left with a person shouting, and "Vape studio" signage along with a bright circular light on buildings in the background. On the wet street, several individuals walk towards the viewer, including a person with a blue umbrella on the far right, followed by others in dark jackets and another under a dark umbrella further back.
end of description.
As the frames advance, all previously visible people move progressively closer to the viewer, with the person initially on the far right exiting the scene. Concurrently, new individuals, notably one in a yellow jacket and another carrying shopping bags, emerge from deeper within the crowd and move towards the viewer, while additional figures become visible in the distant background, also approaching.
