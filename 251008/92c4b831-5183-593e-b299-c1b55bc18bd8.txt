The first frame presents a wet urban street scene on a rainy day. A row of buildings housing various storefronts, including "WORLD" and "Felice," lines the left side, fronted by a lighter-tiled sidewalk where a small potted plant is visible. To the viewer's right and extending into the mid-ground, a reddish-brown tiled sidewalk, soaked with rain, parallels a wet asphalt street with white crosswalk markings and orange traffic bollards. A large tree with green foliage stands on the right sidewalk, near which a person in a purple garment is squatting, and a motorcycle is parked further down the street next to a blue bicycle sign. Distant buildings fade into the misty background.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, light rain continues to fall, creating subtle ripples on the wet surfaces. A red car, initially observed slightly behind the parked motorcycle in the mid-ground right, begins to move forward along the wet street. The car then proceeds to pass the motorcycle and continues further into the misty distance on the right side of the street, while the person in purple remains in their stationary position near the tree.
