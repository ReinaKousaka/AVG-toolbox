The first frame displays a wet, rainy outdoor scene looking down a path. To the left, a dark bike path marked with a white bicycle symbol and an arrow leads away from the viewer, bordered by a dense green hedge on an upward slope. To the right, a white line separates a wet pedestrian walkway from the bike path, lined with several large tree trunks, the closest prominent on the far right. Beyond the trees, a glistening road stretches into a misty distance with faint vehicles and a distant blue sign visible under an overcast sky.

Throughout the following frames, the scene remains static in composition, with the primary dynamic change being the continuous rainfall. Raindrops are visibly striking the wet surfaces of the bike path, pedestrian walkway, and road, causing subtle shimmering and disturbances in the water puddles and reflections. The misty quality of the background persists, indicating the ongoing downpour without revealing any new objects or significant scene alterations.

The first frame depicts a wet, dark paved path stretching from the foreground to the midground on the left, bordered by a continuous, dense green hedge on an elevated bank to the viewer's immediate left. To the right of the path, a narrower, lighter-colored wet sidewalk runs parallel, lined with several tall trees whose dark trunks stand firmly, leading the eye towards the midground. Further to the right, a wet road is visible with distant vehicles, a blue traffic sign, and a yellow warning sign, while the background reveals hazy buildings under an overcast, rainy sky.

Subsequent frames show continuous rainfall, with visible drops and ripples on all wet surfaces. In frame 4, a prominent splash of water erupts on the distant road to the right, behind the third tree from the viewer, suggesting a vehicle passing through a puddle. This splash quickly dissipates over the next two frames. From frame 7, a different vehicle appears on the distant right road, and a red traffic light becomes more clearly visible beyond the blue sign in the final frames.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a wet sidewalk extending from the foreground on the left, bordered by a green hedge and several trees. To the right of the sidewalk, a wet road with yellow markings recedes into the distance, flanked by more tree trunks, with buildings and traffic lights visible in the far background under an overcast sky.
end of description
Subsequent frames reveal a subtle shift in the viewpoint, slowly zooming in and panning slightly to the right. Throughout the sequence, water actively flows across the wet sidewalk and road, accumulating in small pools in the foreground. A white car with illuminated headlights drives from right to left in the distant background, and a traffic light on the right changes from red to green.
