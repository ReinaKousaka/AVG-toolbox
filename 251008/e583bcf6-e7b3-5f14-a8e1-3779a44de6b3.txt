In the first frame, a paved pathway stretches into the distance, bordered by large dark planter boxes containing green bushy plants, with the closest box on the right partially visible. A group of people walks away from the viewer on the path's left side, alongside a man in a black shirt, heading towards a light-colored building in the distant background. To the right, a sunny grassy area with trees features a red and white striped tent-like structure further back.
end of description
As the camera moves forward along the pathway, the initial planter boxes recede from view, and the distant building on the left becomes more prominent, revealing more of its structure. The people on the path continue moving further away, and more of the sunny park environment with trees and grassy areas is gradually revealed to the right.
