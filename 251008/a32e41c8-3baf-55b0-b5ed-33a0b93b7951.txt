The first frame shows a bedroom with a high, pitched ceiling made of light wooden planks and white support beams, featuring two rectangular skylights displaying blue sky and clouds. Centrally, a black projector hangs from a beam above a large wooden sleigh-style bed with multiple pillows. To the left of the bed is a bedside table draped with a red cloth, holding a tall lamp with an ornate, light-colored shade, positioned near white curtains. To the right of the bed, a similar lamp sits on a lighter-draped bedside table, with a large glass sliding door revealing an outdoor patio with a metal table and lush greenery beyond.

The camera slowly and smoothly pans right, revealing more of the right side of the room and less of the left. The left bedside table and lamp gradually move out of view to the left, while the full extent of the outdoor patio with its round table and surrounding foliage becomes more prominent to the right, maintaining the initial viewpoint's perspective.
