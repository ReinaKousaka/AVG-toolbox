In the first frame, the viewer faces down a street flanked by multi-story white buildings with traditional Chinese-style roofs on both sides. A sidewalk with a white car and a few pedestrians is visible to the immediate left, while parked cars and more trees line the right sidewalk. A clear, blue sky dominates the upper half, with a distant mountain visible at the end of the road, and a circular map overlay is present in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The white car and pedestrians initially on the left move out of frame to the left, and the parked cars on the right also recede out of view. A light-colored pickup truck on the left and an electric scooter on the right appear and move closer to the midground, while more of the buildings and sidewalks on both sides become newly visible as the scene progresses forward.

The first frame shows a paved road extending into the distance under a clear blue sky. On the left, a silver pickup truck is parked in the foreground, followed by a row of two-story white buildings with traditional roofs, trees, and other parked vehicles extending into the midground. On the right, a light-colored van is parked in the foreground, with another row of similar buildings, trees, and parked cars (including a white SUV) extending into the midground. In the far background, a mountain range is visible directly ahead, beyond the road. Utility poles and wires line both sides of the street.
end of description
As the camera moves forward along the road, the silver pickup truck on the left and the light-colored van on the right move out of view, indicating the viewer is passing them. The white SUV, initially in the midground on the right, approaches the viewer, revealing a dark SUV parked behind it. The buildings and distant mountain remain ahead, appearing slightly closer as the scene progresses.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a street leading away from the viewer, bordered by traditional multi-story buildings under a clear blue sky, with a white SUV driving forward in the road's center. To the left, a white building features a sidewalk with parked cars and a "no parking" sign closest to the viewer, while a brown building with a similar aesthetic lines the right side, with distant mountains in the background and a map overlay in the top-left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the street. The white SUV in front continues further away, and a yellow moped emerges from behind it, moving forward relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the buildings and parked cars previously to the left and right become closer, revealing the storefront text "藏医大药房" on the left, while a person in red on the right sidewalk also moves further ahead.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame depicts a sunlit street flanked by traditional-style buildings; multi-story white buildings line the left with parked cars and a green storefront, while more ornate buildings with wood accents stand on the right. A paved road stretches into the distance, with a white SUV ahead, a white sedan to its right, and a yellow scooter with a rider on the left; a person in red walks on the right sidewalk. Distant mountains are visible centrally under a clear blue sky, with a map overlay in the top-left.
end of description
The yellow scooter with its rider progressively moves closer to the viewer and towards the center-left of the road. Simultaneously, the person in red on the right sidewalk walks further away from the viewer along the right side. The remaining cars in the middle distance maintain their relative positions as the viewer's perspective appears to slowly advance down the street.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a straight road extends from the viewer into the distance, flanked by two-story buildings with traditional roofs on both the left and right. A black SUV is parked on the left foreground, and a white sedan is on the right, slightly further back. In the midground, a white SUV is moving away from the viewer on the road, with small trees lining the sidewalks and utility poles visible on both sides. Distant mountains are seen under a clear blue sky at the horizon, and a circular map overlay is present in the top-left corner.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The black SUV on the left and the white sedan on the right gradually move past the viewer and out of frame, revealing more of the street. New sections of the storefronts and buildings on both sides become visible as the camera advances. The white SUV in the midground remains ahead, appearing to move further into the distance relative to the continually shifting background of trees, buildings, and the distant mountains.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a street extending forward under a clear blue sky, flanked by multi-story buildings with traditional roofs and trees on both sides. Ahead, a white SUV and a motorcycle are moving away from the viewer, while distant mountains are visible straight ahead and a map overlay is in the top-left.
end of description
As frames progress, the viewer moves forward, causing the white SUV and motorcycle to recede further ahead. Buildings and sidewalk elements on both the left and right sides, including parked cars and trees, continually approach the viewer and then move towards the sides, eventually passing out of frame relative to the initial viewpoint. The black car initially visible on the far bottom left also moves out of frame.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a sunlit street scene, viewed head-on. A gray asphalt road with white dashed markings stretches from the bottom center into the distance. To the left, a multi-story white building with ground-level shops lines the street, with a person on a motorcycle in the lower-left foreground and a parked white car further back. On the right, a modern building with large glass windows stands, fronted by two parked white cars and several black and yellow traffic cones. Small trees are visible along both sidewalks, while distant mountains rise under a clear blue sky beyond the urban structures.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The person on the motorcycle in the lower-left foreground steadily shifts out of frame to the left. The buildings and parked cars on both sides become more prominent, revealing new sections of their facades and further stretches of the sidewalk previously beyond the initial frame's edge. Simultaneously, a large white banner with Chinese text emerges on the right side of the road, behind the initially parked white cars. The distant street view and mountains in the far background appear slightly closer as the perspective advances.
