The first frame displays a lively street scene looking down a pedestrian thoroughfare. To the viewer's left, an outdoor caf√© area includes tables, chairs, potted plants, and a large black umbrella, with a person seated at a table. In the immediate foreground, a woman in a blue jacket and green scarf walks towards the viewer on the left side of the path, followed by a man with a bag on her right, both advancing down the street. On the far right, a striped covered cart is visible, while the right side of the street is lined by a building undergoing construction, covered in scaffolding, green netting, and revealing an "OVS" store.

The woman and man in the foreground continue walking towards the viewer, with the woman steadily approaching and eventually moving past the man, exiting the frame to the viewer's far right. The man also draws closer to the viewer, revealing more detail. Meanwhile, other pedestrians further down the street recede into the distance, moving away from the viewer's initial position.

The first frame depicts a narrow street with a partial view of a woman on the bottom right, an outdoor cafe with a black awning on the left, and a scaffolded building on the right, with a man in a white shirt walking towards the viewer in the center amid other pedestrians.

The woman on the right moves out of the frame as the man in the white shirt continues walking forward, then stops while holding a newly visible green umbrella. Concurrently, a new man in a purple shirt appears on the far right of the frame, facing away from the viewer.

In the first frame, a black awning partially covers the upper left, beneath which are two dark outdoor cafe tables and a menu board. An older man with glasses, holding a green umbrella, stands prominently in the mid-ground center facing the viewer, while a man in a purple t-shirt walks away with his back to the viewer on the immediate right. The right side of the scene is dominated by a building under scaffolding, partially obscured by orange safety barriers, and a street bustling with pedestrians and buildings recedes into the background, where an archway is visible.

The man in the purple t-shirt continues walking away from the viewer. The man initially in the center closes his umbrella, then moves towards the viewer's left and slightly away, eventually adjusting something on his shoulder as he moves past the cafe tables. Red boxing gloves appear hanging on the right-side scaffolding. A new man in a blue polo shirt and glasses subsequently emerges on the right side, moving away from the viewer, to the right of the man in purple.

In the first frame, two men walk away from the viewer on a paved street. The man on the left wears a purple t-shirt, and the one on the right wears a blue polo. To their left, a busy street is visible with multi-story buildings, balconies, and various pedestrians; an archway stands further down the street. To their right, a building is covered in scaffolding and orange construction barriers, revealing a brightly lit shop window behind it, with three red Coca-Cola boxing gloves hanging from the scaffolding on the far right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street, causing the two men in the foreground to recede further away from the viewer. The buildings and street details on both sides continuously shift closer and pass by, progressively revealing more of the shop window behind the scaffolding on the right, including the "Intimissimi" logo and mannequins. The background crowd dynamically changes positions, with new figures appearing and others moving out of view, while the distant archway subtly grows larger as the viewpoint approaches.

The first frame displays a lively pedestrian street scene, with two men viewed from behind in the foreground (one in a blue shirt to the right, another in a purple shirt in the center), walking away from the viewer. Multi-story buildings with balconies line both sides of the street, and in the background, a large archway spans the path. On the right, a shop is partially obscured by scaffolding and orange safety barriers.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly moves forward down the street. The two men in the foreground continue walking away, gradually revealing more of the street ahead. Other pedestrians in the mid-ground shift and move, with a woman in a black outfit and cap walking towards the viewer from the left side, becoming more prominent. The scaffolding on the right remains, but new details of the shop windows and people further down the street become clearer.
