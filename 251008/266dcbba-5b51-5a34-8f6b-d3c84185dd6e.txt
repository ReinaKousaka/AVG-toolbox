The first frame depicts a city sidewalk scene with six pedestrians walking away from the viewer in the midground. To the viewer's left, parked NYPD vans line the street adjacent to buildings, while a large building with reflective windows stands on the right. The busy street extends into the background, revealing more tall buildings and a distant "33rd Street" sign.

In subsequent frames, the original pedestrians continue moving further away. A new woman in a light blue top and black pants appears from behind the initial group, walking towards the viewer on the left side of the sidewalk, becoming more prominent as the video progresses.

The first frame captures a city sidewalk with a person in a white "ERROR" t-shirt partially visible on the far left. In the foreground-right, a woman in a light blue top faces the viewer, while two other individuals with their backs to the viewer walk away along a glass building. In the midground, several white NYPD vans are parked on the street alongside a subway entrance and a "33rd Street" sign, with tall buildings lining the street extending into the background.

As the frames progress, the person on the far left quickly moves out of view to the left. The woman in the light blue top walks past the viewer towards the foreground-left, eventually exiting the frame from that side. Concurrently, the two individuals with their backs to the viewer continue walking further away, deeper into the midground, as the street and buildings recede slightly.

The immediate foreground reveals the backs of two individuals walking away from the viewer: one in a purple hoodie slightly to the left of center, and another with long dark hair in a teal jacket positioned further right. To the left, a white NYPD van is parked beside a sidewalk featuring a subway entrance with yellow steps and white railings, beyond which a blue "33rd Street" sign directs to "PATH Trains." Further down the street, several pedestrians walk among towering urban buildings that line both sides, receding into the background.
end of description
The two foreground individuals walk forward, gradually moving out of the frame to the right of the initial viewpoint. Concurrently, a person in a red shirt and red cap, previously partially obscured, fully emerges from behind the rightmost foreground figure and proceeds to walk away from the viewer, passing to the right of the stationary subway entrance. All background buildings, the street, and the parked NYPD vans remain in their initial spatial positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
