In the first frame, a cobblestone street stretches into the distance, flanked by buildings under a clear blue sky. To the left, a brick building with windows is partially obscured by a dark ornate gate adorned with red flowers in the immediate foreground. On the right, a bright yellow building featuring windows, a street lamp, and a "Sint-Margareta" sign dominates the midground, while a man in a brown jacket and jeans walks away from the viewer towards the right edge of the frame. Further down the street, three people walk towards the viewer, with white and pastel-colored buildings lining the street and distant trees visible at the vanishing point.
end of description
The man in the foreground on the right steadily exits the frame to the right. Simultaneously, the group of three people in the midground walks closer towards the viewer, becoming more prominent and central on the cobblestone street. No new objects or scenes are revealed from behind the viewer or to the sides relative to the first-frame viewpoint; only the existing people move within the scene.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame presents a narrow cobblestone street, receding into the background under a blue sky. Buildings line both sides: brown and pastel-colored structures are to the viewer's left, while a prominent yellow brick building stands to the right. Three women are walking from the right side of the street towards the left, across the mid-ground, with the closest woman wearing sunglasses.
end of description
Over the following frames, these three women continue to move past the viewer, progressively exiting the frame towards the left. Their departure fully reveals the previously obscured sections of the cobblestone street and the right-hand yellow building. By the final frame, all three women have moved completely out of sight to the left, leaving the street entirely clear of people.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a narrow, cobblestone alleyway extending into the distance under a bright blue sky. To the viewer's immediate left, a row of multi-story buildings, starting with a brick-colored one closest to the viewer, then transitioning to yellow, pink, and white structures, lines the street. On the right, a tall, vibrant yellow brick building dominates the foreground and mid-ground, casting a shadow onto the cobblestones, followed by a white wall and more distant buildings.

end of description

The most prominent dynamic change observed in the subsequent frames is the gradual lengthening and slight leftward shift of the shadow cast by the yellow building on the right across the cobblestone street. This subtle movement suggests a slow passage of time or a very slight, almost imperceptible camera adjustment. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the viewpoint and static elements remain constant.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows the viewer standing on a cobblestone street, which stretches away into the distance, flanked by buildings on both sides under a clear blue sky. To the left, a row of multi-story buildings with varied facades (yellow, white, and pink) features numerous windows and some flower boxes. On the right, a large yellow brick building dominates the foreground, with a white walled structure appearing further down the street.
end of description
Across the subsequent frames, there are no discernible dynamic changes or newly revealed objects; the viewpoint remains static, and the scene appears identical, showing no movement or alterations from the initial perspective.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows the viewer looking down a cobblestone street flanked by buildings. To the left, a light yellow building with white windows and flower boxes leads to several pink buildings further along the street. To the right, a bright yellow brick building with two windows is followed by a white brick wall, both extending into the distance. The cobblestone street recedes towards a background featuring distant buildings and trees, all under a blue sky with some white clouds. Sunlight casts distinct shadows across the foreground and mid-ground cobblestones from the surrounding buildings.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly advances forward along the cobblestone street from the first-frame position. This movement causes the buildings lining both sides of the street and the street itself to appear progressively closer and slightly larger in the frame. The shadows on the cobblestones also subtly shift and extend.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
A cobblestone street stretches from the foreground into the distance under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's immediate left stands a light yellow building featuring a large white window with flowers and a dark green door, followed by a line of light pink buildings further down the street. To the viewer's immediate right, a vibrant yellow brick building with a small barred window occupies the foreground, giving way to an old white brick wall with a dark base and a door, also receding into the distance. The street curves gently towards the background, where more buildings and trees are visible.
end of description
The viewpoint subtly advances forward along the cobblestone street through the subsequent frames. Consequently, the buildings immediately to the left and right, including the yellow brick facade and the light yellow building, gradually exit the bottom and side edges of the frame. This slight forward motion makes the distant buildings appear incrementally closer and larger, revealing slightly more detail down the street from the first-frame viewpoint. No entirely new objects or scenes are introduced; rather, the existing perspective is slightly magnified and traversed.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a narrow cobblestone street stretching into the distance, flanked by buildings; a light beige building with a dark door is immediately on the left, followed by a row of pale pink buildings, while an old white brick wall with a dark base and a window lines the right, leading to further traditional buildings under a blue sky. The street recedes towards a distant white building nestled among trees.
end of description
As the subsequent frames unfold, the viewer's perspective slowly moves forward along the cobblestone street. All visible objects, including the buildings on both sides and the distant structures, gradually appear closer and larger, without revealing any entirely new objects or scenes. This consistent forward motion maintains the same general view of the street, deepening the sense of progression.
