A narrow, brightly lit urban alleyway at night stretches into the background. In the immediate foreground, to the left, a person wearing a white mask and scarf walks away from the viewer, with green plants beside them. Slightly further ahead and center, another masked person in a dark jacket also walks away, leading into a crowd of pedestrians deeper in the alley. Along the left, buildings feature brick facades, vertical signs, and illuminated menu boards, while the right side displays shop signs, AC units, a tall glass food display case, parked bicycles, and cardboard boxes.

The two masked individuals in the foreground and mid-ground progressively walk further into the alley and eventually out of frame towards the front. Their movement reveals more of the static brick wall on the left and the food display case on the right, which were previously partially obscured. The crowd of people further down the alley continues to move away from the viewer, and no new objects or scenes are revealed from behind the viewer or to the sides.

The viewer looks down a narrow, bustling alley at night, flanked by multi-story buildings housing restaurants and shops. On the left, a brown door and utility boxes are closest, followed by illuminated sandwich board signs lining the walkway. Beyond them, vibrant red lanterns and various glowing signs with Japanese text and food images illuminate the storefronts, with several pedestrians standing and walking further down. On the right, a green crate, a metal cart, and bundled items are visible near the viewer, followed by a large glass display case showcasing food, and numerous illuminated signs extending into the distance, where more pedestrians are present. The dark night sky is visible above the tightly packed buildings.
end of description
The scene subtly shifts as the camera moves very slightly forward and imperceptibly to the right relative to the first-frame viewpoint, causing minor perspective changes for the illuminated signs and buildings lining the alley. No new objects or scenes are distinctly revealed, and the pedestrians within the alley remain largely stationary.

The first frame depicts a narrow, illuminated alleyway at night. To the viewer's immediate left, dark foliage and the bottom of a white utility box are visible. On the right, a metal gate partially obscures a wall adorned with posters. Further down the alley on the left, a restaurant facade with glowing red lanterns and several bright menu boards is seen, with people gathered outside. Directly above this is a large, illuminated sign displaying a dish. On the right side of the alley, another shop or restaurant with lit windows and two small tables outside features a prominent vertical sign with Japanese text. Numerous people are walking away from the viewer in the mid-ground, heading deeper into the alley.
end of description
Throughout the sequence, a yellow vertical sign on the right side of the alley exhibits a subtle flickering in its illumination. Beginning in frame 6, a new individual in a dark coat enters the foreground from the bottom-left, progressively moving towards the right. This person continues to advance across the left side of the frame, eventually positioning themselves to view the illuminated menu boards that were already present on the left of the first-frame viewpoint.

In the first frame, a brightly lit, narrow street at night extends into the distance. A large, illuminated menu board stands in the immediate foreground on the left, partially obscuring a person in a grey coat walking away from the viewer. To the left, a building facade is adorned with hanging red lanterns and multiple illuminated menu displays, while on the right, a storefront features a glass display of food items, a small table with chairs, and a yellow poster. Pedestrians populate the midground, all walking away from the viewer towards numerous glowing signs on distant buildings under a dark sky.
end of description
The person in the grey coat continues walking further into the midground. Subsequently, a new individual with long dark hair, wearing a black coat, enters the frame from the immediate foreground left, gradually obscuring the menu board. This person also walks away from the viewer, joining the flow of pedestrians further down the street.

First frame: A narrow, bustling street at night is visible, flanked by buildings adorned with numerous illuminated food signs and traditional red Chinese lanterns on the left. In the immediate foreground, a person's back is visible to the viewer, standing beside an illuminated menu board displaying food options; many other pedestrians walk away down the street, which is also lined by glass storefronts and signs on the right.
end of description
Over successive frames, the foreground person and the stream of pedestrians progressively move further away from the viewer, while a person is seen emerging from a doorway on the far left and a stroller shifts its position on the right.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a vibrant, narrow street at night, bustling with pedestrians moving away from the viewer. To the left, a restaurant with illuminated food displays and decorative red lanterns lines the street, fronted by a large menu board in the foreground, while another restaurant with a yellow sign is visible to the right.

end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, a man previously standing by the left restaurant entrance moves further left and out of frame, revealing more of the interior. Simultaneously, the man in the foreground looking at the menu board shifts slightly to the left. The crowd of pedestrians in the mid-ground continuously moves forward, causing shifts in their positions and revealing slightly more of the restaurant exterior on the right.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a narrow, brightly lit street at night, adorned with numerous glowing Chinese/Japanese signs and lanterns, receding into the distance. In the immediate foreground, partial figures stand to the left and right; a woman walks away in the midground center, flanked by a masked man with a hand truck on the left and a group of people, including a person with a large dark backpack, on the right.
end of description
Subsequently, the foreground right figure moves further right, revealing more of the crowded path. The midground figures shift, with the man holding the hand truck on the left turning slightly towards the viewer, and the person with the dark backpack on the right also turning forward, both now clearly visible wearing masks, as the woman in the center continues walking deeper into the scene.
