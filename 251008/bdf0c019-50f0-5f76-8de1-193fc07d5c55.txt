The first frame prominently features a multi-story brick building directly in front of the viewer, adorned with numerous dark-framed windows and balconies with black railings on its right side. At ground level, a dark entrance, planters with green foliage and red flowers, and a black and white mural are visible directly in front, while a brown wooden structure with an overhang is partially present to the viewer's far left.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly shifts slightly upwards and to the right, minimally revealing more of the building's top edge. Concurrently, a dark, triangular object gradually descends into the top center of the frame, partially obscuring the sky above the building.
