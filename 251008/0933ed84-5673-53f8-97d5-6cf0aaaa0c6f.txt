A paved path curves from the lower left towards the center of the frame, bordered by dense green bushes and some with reddish-brown foliage in the immediate foreground on the right. Further back, a thick evergreen forest with tall pine and fir trees dominates the midground and background under a clear blue sky, with a sun flare visible in the upper right corner.

As the viewpoint progresses, the foreground bushes on the right recede, revealing more of the paved path ahead. The entire scene appears to move forward, with the dense evergreen forest drawing closer as the viewer travels deeper into the path's curve.
