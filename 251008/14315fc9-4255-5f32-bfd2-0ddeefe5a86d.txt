The first frame shows a view from beneath an overhead structure, looking forward along train tracks that curve slightly to the right. Above the viewer, a dark metal canopy partially obscures the blue sky, while a brick wall borders the far right. To the left, a concrete retaining wall supports a road, with wooded hills and snow-capped mountains visible in the background, framing the valley where industrial buildings and structures line the tracks in the mid-distance. The text "Zernez â†‘ 1470m" is overlaid at the bottom center of the frame.

As the train moves forward, the dark canopy and the brick wall on the far right recede, revealing more of the clear blue sky and snow-capped mountains in the background. The support pillar on the left moves out of view, offering a clearer perspective of green industrial silos and a yellow vehicle further left, beyond the concrete wall. Simultaneously, a building with stacks of large cylindrical concrete pipes and a flatbed railcar becomes fully visible on the right. The tracks extend further into the mountainous valley, with distant forested slopes and snow-peaked summits remaining in view as the scene opens up.

First, a train station in a mountain valley is viewed along two sets of tracks stretching into the distance under a bright blue sky with one cloud. To the left, a corrugated building sits on a raised platform beside tracks, flanked by a grassy area, signs, and a forested mountain. To the right, a wooden building with stacked concrete pipes and a flatbed railcar lies next to the tracks, with snow-capped mountains and power lines overhead.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the central utility pole, the corrugated building on the left, and the wooden building on the right gradually recede towards the sides and then behind the viewer, relative to the initial position. The raised platform on the left extends further into view, revealing additional station infrastructure and buildings ahead along the continuously unfolding tracks.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a first-person view looking forward along two sets of train tracks running into the distance. To the immediate left is a concrete platform leading to several buildings, including a prominent stone structure. To the right, parallel to the tracks, is a gravel area with a long, low building and various construction materials stacked. Overhead, train catenary lines span the scene, and in the far background, snow-capped mountains rise under a bright blue sky with a single cloud on the left.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses forward along the tracks. The platform on the left, buildings on both sides, and construction materials recede backward and to the sides. A small rectangular platform section with a yellow strip emerges beneath the viewer and passes, as does a blue sign on the left. A yellow signal post on the right also passes out of view as the tracks converge further in the distance.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The viewer is positioned on a train track, looking ahead into a mountain valley. Two main tracks are visible directly in front, diverging slightly before converging again in the mid-distance. To the left of the tracks, a concrete platform borders the railway, with a low wooden building further back, and a steep, tree-covered mountain beyond. To the right, a gravel area displays various construction materials like pipes and wrapped pallets, situated next to a large building, with another tree-covered mountain rising on the far right. In the distant center, beyond the immediate railway infrastructure, snow-capped mountains stand prominently under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The train progressively moves forward, causing the immediate foreground tracks and the concrete platform on the left to recede from the bottom of the frame. A yellow truck becomes visible on the right side, appearing from behind the stacked construction materials. Subsequently, a blue rectangular sign is revealed on the left side of the tracks in the middle ground, growing larger as the train continues its forward motion towards it. The background scenery, including the distant snow-capped mountains, remains largely stationary while closer objects appear to pass by.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a train station scene from a forward-looking perspective. In the immediate foreground, a blue sign is partially visible at the bottom left, while multiple train tracks filled with gravel extend into the midground. To the left, adjacent to the tracks, is a concrete platform with several buildings behind it, including one featuring a yellow gantry or crane. Towards the right, extensive stacks of white pipes and construction materials are visible, with a yellow truck parked further back and a brown building nestled among them. In the background, lush, forested mountains rise steeply on both the left and right sides, framing a distant view of towering, snow-capped mountains under a clear blue sky crisscrossed by power lines.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the train tracks, causing the blue sign to exit the lower left of the frame. The platform and its adjacent buildings, along with the stacks of pipes and the yellow truck on the right, progressively move past the viewer towards the sides and eventually out of view. As the viewpoint advances, new sections of the railway and the station platform are continuously revealed directly in front of the viewer, indicating a steady forward progression through the scene.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a train station with two main tracks stretching from the foreground into the distance, flanked by a grey platform with white markings. To the left, additional tracks run alongside a large yellow gantry crane and a light grey building with red bay doors, while a pile of gravel is visible behind them. On the right, more tracks parallel a brown wooden building, with various industrial materials like stacked pipes and tanks situated further right. The background is dominated by majestic snow-capped mountains under a clear blue sky, with overhead power lines crossing the top of the scene.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks. The yellow gantry crane and the building to its left gradually move out of frame, receding to the left of the original viewpoint. Concurrently, a tall street lamp post and a signal pole emerge from the distant tracks, approaching and then passing the initial viewpoint on the left and right respectively, while the wooden building and materials on the right recede further into the background relative to the first-frame position.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
First, a train station scene unfolds with multiple tracks extending centrally into the distance, bordered by a wide platform on the left and a narrower one on the right. Midground objects include a modern building and a gravel pile on the left, and a traditional wooden station house with a white van on the right, all framed by forested and snow-capped mountains under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, a signal pole prominently on the right recedes and disappears out of view to the viewer's right. Concurrently, a blue "Zernez" sign appears on the lamp post on the left platform, which then moves progressively out of frame to the viewer's left. The entire scene shifts backward, revealing new sections of track and platform that were previously directly in front of and behind the initial viewpoint, indicating a continuous forward movement through the station.
