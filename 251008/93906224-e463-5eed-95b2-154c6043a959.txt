The first frame depicts two elderly people walking away from the viewer on a wooden path with railings on its left, surrounded by trees with sparse foliage and fallen leaves, extending from the foreground into the background, under a bright sky. A 'SEOUL WALKER' watermark is at the bottom-left.
end of description
Subsequently, the two individuals continue walking along the path, gradually moving further into the midground and eventually exiting the frame towards the background right. This movement reveals more of the empty wooden path, which curves slightly to the right in the distance, while the surrounding forest and trees remain consistently positioned on both sides.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a wide, reddish-brown path stretching into the distance, flanked by wooden railings on both sides. To the viewer's left, a gentle downhill slope covered in dry leaves and sparse greenery leads to numerous tree trunks, while to the right, an upward slope with similar foliage and tree trunks creates a forested corridor. The background is dense with trees, many bare-branched, though some exhibit patches of green and autumnal red/orange leaves, all under a bright sky.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the path, causing the previously distant trees and the path ahead to approach and expand in view. As the journey progresses, the immediate surroundings—including the railings, the slopes, and the individual tree trunks on either side—dynamically shift, revealing new sections of the forest previously further away from the initial viewpoint. The scene remains a continuous forest path, with the perspective advancing further into the woodland.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
A brown wooden boardwalk path with a dark railing on its left side extends from the foreground into the midground. The ground to the immediate left and right of the path, and beyond, is covered in a dense layer of dry, fallen leaves. A thick forest of deciduous trees, with a mix of green, golden, and reddish foliage along with bare branches, fills the midground and background, under a partly visible blue sky. A "SEOUL WALKER" watermark is situated in the bottom-left corner.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the boardwalk, causing the initial foreground and midground sections of the path and surrounding forest to gradually recede behind the first-frame viewpoint. New segments of the path and the dense forest, previously hidden further ahead in the background of the initial frame, are continuously revealed directly in front of the viewer as the journey progresses. Shadows on the path shift subtly with the movement.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A brown wooden boardwalk path with low railings extends from the bottom center into the middle distance, flanked by dense woods on both sides. Trees with varying foliage, including green, sparse, and hints of red/orange leaves, along with bare branches, line the path, and fallen leaves cover the ground. A bright blue sky is visible through the tree canopy above.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the boardwalk, revealing more of the path ahead as the surrounding trees and foliage recede to the sides. The perspective advances deeper into the woodland, maintaining the initial spatial relationship to the viewer's forward movement through the consistent natural environment.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a wooden boardwalk path extends from the bottom center towards the mid-ground, curving slightly to the right. To the left of the path, a gentle slope is covered in trees with varied foliage and fallen leaves, revealing a section of another wooden structure or platform further back. The right side of the path features similar leaf-covered ground and trees, with dense forest foliage comprising green, yellow, and hints of red leaves dominating the background. A bright sky is visible through the tree canopy at the top.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward along the wooden path, causing the foreground path to recede and reveal new sections of the path and the surrounding forest ahead. The trees and foliage along both sides of the path appear to move backward relative to the viewer, progressively revealing more of the path directly in front.
