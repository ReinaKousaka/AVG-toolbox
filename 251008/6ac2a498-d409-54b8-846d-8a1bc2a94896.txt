The first frame displays a city street scene from a sidewalk viewpoint, with a multi-story building featuring large glass windows and "KINOKUNIYA INTERNATIONAL MARKET B1F" visible to the viewer's left. People walk on this sidewalk, some wearing masks, with bicycles parked further down, while across a metal barrier to the right, a street hosts vehicles including a silver van, a white car, a red car, and a dark car, all framed by distant tall buildings.

Subsequently, numerous pedestrians on the left sidewalk move both towards and away from the viewer, including a woman in a blue shirt and jeans and another in a light top and dark pants who walks prominently towards the viewer. On the street to the right, the silver van, white car, and red car drive away from the viewer, followed by a dark car and then a black SUV entering from the right and moving away. A cyclist also rides towards the viewer on the left sidewalk as people continue to flow.

The first frame displays a vibrant city street scene. On the left, a sidewalk bustles with pedestrians, with a woman in a white shirt and mask in the immediate foreground walking towards the viewer, alongside a cyclist approaching from slightly further back. Behind them, multi-story buildings with commercial fronts like "KINOKUNIYA" line the street. To the right, a gray pole and metal barrier separate the sidewalk from a multi-lane road where a silver van is parked, followed by a black car further down, all heading away from the viewer amidst distant skyscrapers.
end of description
As the frames progress, the pedestrians on the left sidewalk and the cyclist continuously move towards and then past the viewer, revealing more people and storefronts further down the street. Concurrently, the silver van on the right side of the road starts to pull away from its parked position, moving forward and away from the first-frame viewpoint. This action eventually reveals a white SUV that was previously partially obscured, also moving forward down the street within the existing right-side traffic lane.

The first frame captures a city street scene with pedestrians on a paved sidewalk to the left, including a partially visible woman and a man in a black shirt close to the viewer, while a silver van and a white car occupy the road on the right, flanked by tall buildings.
end of description
The woman and the man in the black shirt move past the viewer and exit the frame to the left as the silver van on the right drives away. Subsequently, a new man in a black shirt and mask emerges from the mid-ground left, walking towards the viewer. Concurrently, the white car on the right also recedes, revealing a dark SUV further down the street. As the man on the left passes out of view, a woman in a mask becomes clearly visible leaning against a utility box in the mid-ground right, while the vehicles continue to recede into the distance on the right.

The first frame displays a bustling city street featuring a woman in a mask on the immediate right, next to a grey utility box, with several bicycles parked behind her. To the left, a sidewalk teems with pedestrians passing multi-story buildings, while a street with a white van and a silver car extends into the background under a light blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the woman on the right remains relatively stationary. On the street, the white van and silver car continue to move away from the viewer, soon followed by a white delivery truck that emerges from behind the utility box on the right and proceeds further down the road. Simultaneously, numerous pedestrians continuously traverse the left sidewalk, with new individuals, including a person wearing a blue backpack and mask, walking towards the viewer.
