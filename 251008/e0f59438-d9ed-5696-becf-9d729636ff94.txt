The first frame depicts a wet city sidewalk on an overcast day, with two people carrying clear umbrellas walking away from the viewer. The person on the left, with a black backpack, and another slightly ahead to the center, with a green shoulder bag, occupy the immediate foreground. To the right, a large building facade with a parking entrance, various blue informational signs, and a yellow 'P' sign is visible, contrasting with a street, crosswalk, and red traffic light on the left.

As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward along the sidewalk. The two foreground pedestrians continue walking ahead and slightly further from the viewer, while previously unseen sections of the sidewalk and the building's facade on the right gradually come into view directly ahead of the initial viewpoint.

Two individuals, seen from behind, walk directly away from the viewer, prominent in the foreground. The person on the left wears a backpack and holds a clear umbrella, while the one on the right has a green messenger bag and also holds a clear umbrella. To their left, a wet street with white markings leads towards a distant traffic light, which shows green, and tall buildings. To their right, a building facade features a blue 'entrance' sign and some greenery, with more pedestrians visible further along the sidewalk, also walking away from the viewer.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the two foreground individuals continue walking away from the viewer. A white van enters the frame from the far left of the street, moving from left to right past the green traffic light. Simultaneously, new pedestrians emerge from the far right along the sidewalk, walking towards the viewer, passing by the blue 'entrance' sign. By the final frames, a person in a dark jacket and mask becomes clearly visible walking towards the viewer on the right sidewalk.

The first frame captures a rainy city street from the perspective of someone walking on a wet, reddish-brown sidewalk. In the immediate foreground, two individuals holding large clear umbrellas partially obscure the view; one is on the far left, and another is slightly right of center with a khaki shoulder bag. To the left, a white van is visible moving away from the viewer in the street, beneath a green traffic light, while a tall glass building rises in the background. On the right, a multi-story building with green foliage features a blue directional sign, and a group of people, several with umbrellas (including one purple polka-dotted) and wearing masks, walk towards the viewer on the sidewalk.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the wet street. The two initial foreground figures holding clear umbrellas move further away and slightly to the sides, revealing more of the scene. Simultaneously, the group of people approaching from the right side of the sidewalk in the midground become progressively closer to the viewer. The individual with the purple polka-dot umbrella, initially further back on the right, noticeably advances towards the viewer.

In the first frame, the viewer is on a wet sidewalk, observing a rainy street scene. Immediately to the left is the back of a person holding a clear umbrella and wearing a dark backpack, while directly in front, facing away, is another individual in a dark jacket, black cap, and an olive green messenger bag. To the right, further down the sidewalk, is a blue sign with Japanese text "入口" (Entrance) and "Times," pointing right; several pedestrians holding umbrellas, including one with a blue umbrella and another with a clear umbrella and white mask, are walking towards the viewer on this side. Buildings with reflective windows and traffic lights are visible in the distant background to the left, and a lighter-colored building with green foliage lines the sidewalk on the far right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the pedestrians in the foreground, including the person with the backpack and the individual with the messenger bag, continue walking forward. Simultaneously, the people approaching on the right side of the sidewalk draw closer to the viewer; the person with the blue umbrella and the person with the white mask become more distinct, moving from the midground towards the foreground-right. Further into the sequence, a new person in a red jacket and beige pants, under a blue umbrella and holding a coffee cup, emerges from the midground and approaches from the right side. The overall scene shows continuous movement of pedestrians on the rainy urban street, with elements on the right gradually shifting from midground to foreground as they approach the viewer's initial position.

In the first frame, the viewer is on a wet city sidewalk, looking down a street filled with pedestrians carrying umbrellas on a rainy day. Immediately in the foreground on the left are the backs of two people holding clear umbrellas, while directly in front of the viewer is another person's back with a black jacket and a green messenger bag, also under a clear umbrella. To the right, a person in a red jacket and a blue umbrella walks towards the viewer, holding a phone and a cup. Further down the street, in the midground, numerous pedestrians walk away from the viewer, mostly under clear umbrellas, flanked by buildings on both sides, with a building facade and some greenery on the right.
end of description
The person in the red jacket and blue umbrella walks past the viewer towards the left of the frame and exits the scene. A new person wearing a grey jacket and a dark face mask, holding a clear umbrella, enters from the mid-right, approaching and then walking past the viewer from right to left across the mid-ground. The group of pedestrians in the center-left continues moving away, while the entire viewpoint subtly shifts forward, revealing more of a multi-colored sign on the building facade to the right.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a rainy city sidewalk from a pedestrian's viewpoint, with clear umbrellas partially visible to the immediate left and top right, and the back of a person in a black coat with a green messenger bag central to the foreground. Ahead, people walk on the wet pavement under umbrellas, including a group approaching from the midground, while a building featuring "WASHINGTON HOTEL" signage and green foliage lines the sidewalk to the right.
end of description.
As frames progress, the foreground person subtly shifts forward and left, while the group in the midground, prominently featuring a man in a blue coat and mask holding an umbrella, walks closer towards the viewer. Simultaneously, pedestrians on the left recede further into the background, and a white truck becomes visible on the distant street to the far left.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a rainy city street is seen from a pedestrian's perspective. In the immediate foreground-left, a person wearing a black jacket and cap, carrying a clear umbrella and a green shoulder bag, walks towards the right. To the mid-right, two individuals, both wearing masks and holding clear umbrellas, walk towards the viewer. The background on the left features a street with buildings, signs, and a zebra crossing, while the background on the right shows a large building with columns and green foliage near its entrance.
end of description
The three individuals initially in the foreground and mid-right continue moving, with the two on the right passing the viewer's immediate position. A new individual emerges from the mid-right, holding a dark blue umbrella and pulling a rolling suitcase, walking towards and past the viewer. As this person moves from the midground to the immediate foreground-right, more of the "Washington Hotel" sign and a "docomo" logo on the building to the right become visible. Finally, as this last individual exits the frame on the far right, the view opens up, revealing more of the distant street, pedestrians, and surrounding buildings previously obscured by the passing people.
