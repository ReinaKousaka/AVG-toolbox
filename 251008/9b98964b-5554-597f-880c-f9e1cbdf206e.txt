In the first frame, a large open-plan room is visible. To the right in the foreground, part of a dark dining table and chairs sits on a patterned rug. In the midground to the right, a kitchen island with bar stools is present, behind which are kitchen cabinets, a stove with a large range hood, and a window. To the left in the midground, a living area contains a green sofa, an armchair, a floor lamp, and a dark side table. Further left, a black cabinet with a large painting and two lamps is against the wall. A wide wooden floor extends from the foreground to the background, where an arched doorway leads into a hallway, and to its right, more kitchen cabinetry and another arched opening are visible.

As the camera moves forward, the dining table and living room furniture recede out of view to the left and right, respectively. The kitchen island and stove, initially to the mid-right, also shift further right and are eventually replaced by tall grey cabinets which move into the background to the right. The arched doorway, initially in the background center, becomes more prominent as the viewer approaches it, revealing more of the hallway extending further into the background with a wooden door at its end and light fixtures overhead.
