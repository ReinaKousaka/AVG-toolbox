The first frame presents two train tracks curving into the distance, flanked by a calm lake with snow-capped mountains to the left and a steep, rocky hillside with a small white building and power pole to the right, all beneath overhead electrical lines.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks. The initial white building on the right hillside recedes, revealing a cluster of several more houses further along the right, while a dark shed and then a white utility box appear and recede along the left side of the tracks. The power pole also moves closer then recedes, as new sections of the overhead electrical infrastructure become visible and pass.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a view looking straight down a pair of railway tracks that curve gently to the right in the mid-distance. To the left of the tracks, a calm body of water extends towards snow-capped mountains in the far background, with bare trees lining the embankment, and a dark signal pole close to the tracks. To the right, a steep, rocky hillside rises, featuring several white houses built into the slope, ascending from the mid-ground, with a power line structure visible further down the tracks. Overhead, power lines stretch across the frame against an overcast sky.
end of description
As the train moves forward, the signal pole on the left approaches and then passes the viewer, revealing more of the water and distant mountains. Simultaneously, the houses on the right appear progressively larger and closer, indicating the train is moving past them. A large power line pylon, initially further down the track on the right, also grows closer and begins to pass the viewer, signifying continuous forward motion through the landscape.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
From a forward-facing train viewpoint, railway tracks recede into the distance, bordered on the left by a body of water with bare trees and distant snow-capped mountains. To the right, a grassy, rocky embankment rises, featuring a large white house in the mid-right and a smaller one higher up the steep, dark mountain. Overhead, utility lines stretch along the tracks under an overcast sky, with a partial yellow sign visible on the far left.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances along the tracks, the prominent white house on the right recedes and moves out of frame. Simultaneously, a utility pole close to the tracks grows larger and passes, revealing a paved road, a white bench, and a parked car higher up the right embankment. The scene continuously unveils new sections of rocky terrain and bare trees alongside the tracks, while the tunnel entrance ahead steadily approaches.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a train's-eye view looking forward along parallel tracks, which extend into the distance. To the left, a wide body of water (likely a fjord) is visible with bare trees lining its near bank, and snow-capped mountains rise in the far distance across the water. To the right, a steep, rocky hillside borders the tracks, upon which a white multi-story house with a distinct roof is perched in the mid-ground, accompanied by a street light.

end of description

As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the white house and adjacent streetlight on the right pass by, revealing more of the steep, rocky hillside. Concurrently, the bare trees and water body on the left gradually recede behind the viewer. Further ahead on the right, a tall metal train support structure comes into view and passes, followed by a small wooden shed-like structure and more retaining walls along the hillside as the train continues its journey.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a train track receding into the distance, with overhead power lines, flanked on the left by a body of water and bare trees, and on the right by a steep, rocky hillside. A yellow warning sign, a small wooden building, and a glowing streetlamp are visible along the right hillside, with distant snow-capped mountains appearing across the water to the left.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, objects on the right, including the yellow sign, wooden building, and streetlamp, move closer to the viewer before passing out of sight to the right. The distant mountains and the body of water on the left gradually recede behind the viewer, emphasizing the continuous forward motion through the landscape.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows train tracks receding into the distance, flanked by a body of water with bare trees and snow-capped mountains on the left, and a steep, rocky hillside with a utility pole, overhead wires, and a glowing streetlamp on the right, all under a grey sky.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the immediate landscape shifts, with bare trees on the left and the rocky hillside on the right appearing to move closer and pass towards the sides. Utility poles and overhead wires, initially in the mid-distance on the right, progressively approach and pass the viewer. The small structure on the right side of the tracks also comes closer and moves towards the right before receding, as new sections of the track and a similar landscape ahead are continuously revealed.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, train tracks extend centrally from the viewer into the distance, curving slightly left. To the left, a body of water with snow-capped mountains beyond is visible, bordered by bare trees. On the right, a rocky, barren hillside rises, featuring a small yellow building and a streetlight in the mid-ground, both elevated above the tracks. Overhead power lines recede along the tracks.
end of description
As the train advances, the yellow building and streetlight on the right hillside move closer and then out of the upper right frame. A large metal utility pole and a fence appear to the right of the tracks, moving from the mid-ground into the immediate foreground and then passing by the viewer. Concurrently, additional structures become visible among the trees on the left, further along the waterfront, as the scene progresses.
