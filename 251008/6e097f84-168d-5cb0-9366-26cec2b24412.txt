The first frame, viewed aerially, displays about nine brown and reddish-brown horses scattered across a dry, reddish-brown and lighter-colored ground in the midground and foreground, with a strip of green grass and distant hills in the background.
end of description
Subsequently, the horses in the midground and foreground begin moving collectively towards the top-center, away from the viewer. Simultaneously, the camera pulls back and pans slightly upward, progressively revealing more of the expansive green landscape and hills previously in the distant background. A significantly larger herd of around 15-20 horses continuously emerges from the viewer's sides and background, advancing in unison, with new individuals also appearing in the immediate foreground, entering from the bottom-left and bottom-right of the original frame.
