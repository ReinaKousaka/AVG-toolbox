The first frame shows a paved road extending into the distance under a blue sky with white clouds, flanked by green trees and buildings on both sides; parked cars are visible to the front-left, and a white car is further down the road ahead of the viewer.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the parked vehicles on the left, initially to the front-left, approach, pass, and exit the frame to the left, while new buildings and parked cars are gradually revealed further along this side. The trees and buildings on the right also draw closer and shift towards the right edge of the frame, revealing a street light pole behind the large mid-right tree. The distant white car, initially ahead of the viewer, appears closer as the viewer advances, maintaining its position ahead.

The first frame shows a broad asphalt road extending into the distance under a blue sky with scattered white clouds. To the viewer's immediate left, a black SUV is partially visible, followed by a white car and a row of commercial buildings lined with green trees and a floral street island. On the right, a large leafy tree stands prominently in the mid-foreground with a lamppost extending from it, bordering another street island densely packed with greenery, behind which a building with a dark roof is visible. Further down the central road, a white car is seen, while mountains are faintly visible on the horizon.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the road. The black SUV and the white car on the viewer's immediate left in the first frame progressively move out of view to the left. As these vehicles exit the scene, a red car, previously partially obscured, becomes fully visible parked further along the left side. Simultaneously, on the right, the large tree and lamppost recede upwards relative to the frame, while the landscaping and parked vehicles further down the road, including a white van, become closer and more distinct to the viewer's progressing position. The overall street scene continuously extends forward, revealing more of the environment ahead.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame captures a sunlit street scene with a blue, partly cloudy sky overhead. A paved road extends from the viewer towards distant mountains, flanked by lush greenery and buildings. On the left, a large, dark-leafed tree stands prominently, with a building, flowerbed, and green hedges behind it, further revealing parked vehicles including a white bus down the street. On the right, a lighter-green tree is prominent, with a dark-roofed building, a white van, and a silver SUV parked behind it, while closer to the viewer are flowering shrubs. Two cars are visible on the road in the distance.
end of description
The camera gradually moves forward along the street. All objects, including the prominent trees and buildings on both sides, slowly enlarge and shift slightly to the left in the frame as the viewer advances. The white van parked on the right moves slightly forward and to the left, and the distant white car also proceeds further down the road.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a street view looking forward, with a paved road occupying the center, leading towards distant mountains under a blue sky with scattered clouds. To the left, a low green hedge runs alongside the road, backed by parked vehicles and commercial buildings with awnings. On the right, large leafy trees and smaller plants border the road, with more parked vehicles further back. A white car is visible in the far distance, driving away from the viewer.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the foreground elements on both sides of the road move out of view, while the distant mountains appear closer. Two pedestrians appear from the right side of the road in the mid-ground and begin walking left across the street, passing in front of the viewer. Simultaneously, the white car in the distance moves further away from the viewer.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame presents a sunny street scene with a row of parked vehicles and buildings, including a 'Four Square Supermarket' sign, on the left. Green trees and bushes line a sidewalk on the right, with a 'Britz' campervan parked further down, while two pedestrians are centrally crossing the road from left to right towards the distant mountains.
end of description
The two pedestrians continue walking from the midground across the road, progressing towards the right side of the frame. They then move beyond the viewer's current field of vision, disappearing behind the trees and bushes on the right.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a street scene leading towards distant mountains under a partly cloudy sky. To the viewer's left, a row of shops with a "SQUARE SUPERMARKET" sign are visible, with several parked cars and two pedestrians walking away on the pavement. On the right, large trees and bushes line the street, with a white van and an orange car parked further down, while two white cars are visible driving in the far distance.
end of description
The two pedestrians on the left continue walking further away from the viewer. Simultaneously, a bird flies across the upper sky from the left-mid toward the upper-right, as the distant cars recede along the road.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a street leading towards distant mountains under a partly cloudy sky. To the left, a large tree, a building, and a parked car are present, while a white van and other vehicles line the road to the right, with a bird visible high in the sky.
end of description.
As the camera advances, objects like the large tree and building to the left, and the white van and trees to the right, progressively move out of view, eventually becoming behind the initial viewpoint. The road ahead and distant mountains become more dominant, revealing further portions of the street and additional buildings extending forward to both sides of the original position.
