The first frame depicts a wet city street on a rainy day. To the immediate right, a tree trunk partially obscures an orange and black scooter parked on the red-marked section of the asphalt road. To the left, a wet brick sidewalk is lined with various storefronts displaying illuminated Korean signs and potted plants, including a prominent white vertical sign with red text '휴 인테리어' on the far left. Further down the wet road, a white car is visible moving away from the viewer, with a tree-covered hillside and a fence bordering the right side of the street.

The scooter, initially behind the tree on the right, shifts slightly forward and to the left from its original position. A red and white traffic cone, followed by a black chair, subsequently appear on the wet road to the right, near the scooter's initial parking spot. These newly appeared objects then progressively move further down the road, away from the viewer's original perspective. The white car in the background continues to recede into the distance, while a person with an umbrella briefly becomes visible far down the left sidewalk, also moving away from the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a wet city street on a rainy day, with buildings and storefronts displaying various Korean signs lining the sidewalk to the left. To the right, a wet asphalt road with painted markings leads into the distance, bordered by trees, a guardrail, and a black chair with a red box in the foreground.

As the frames progress, the black chair and red box near the viewer on the right side of the road disappear. A light-colored car appears in the distance on the wet road ahead, moving towards the viewer before passing by further down the street. Additionally, a reddish-brown dog briefly appears on the sidewalk to the far left, near the storefronts, before moving out of view.

The first frame displays a rainy urban street scene viewed from a sidewalk, looking forward down a wet brick path bordered by illuminated storefronts on the left, where a brown dog and a white covered object are visible. To the right, a tree and a utility pole stand beside a wet asphalt road with white markings, extending into a misty distance lined with a fence and trees.

Subsequently, the neon signs on the left-side storefronts, particularly the large red and green one mid-left, dynamically animate their illumination patterns throughout the following frames, while the consistent rainfall persists across the entire scene.
