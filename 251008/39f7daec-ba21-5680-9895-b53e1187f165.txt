frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame captures a view looking upwards into a sunlit forest, featuring numerous tall trees, predominantly evergreens, with several prominent trunks in the foreground and mid-ground, and a street light pole visible on the left, positioned slightly behind the nearest trees.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the trees initially in the immediate foreground recede from the viewer, while previously mid-ground trees shift closer and new trees from the far right of the first-frame viewpoint emerge centrally. The street light pole, initially on the left, gradually shifts further left and becomes less prominent relative to the first-frame's perspective. A bright lens flare also appears on the far left in later frames, indicating the sun's position.
