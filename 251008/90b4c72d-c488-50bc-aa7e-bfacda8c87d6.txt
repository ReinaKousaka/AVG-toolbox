The first frame reveals a mountain valley with a lush green field on the right and a road on the left, bordered by a wooden fence. A person with a red backpack stands by the road, adjacent to a blue parking sign and a directional sign pointing right towards "Lauterbrunnen". Further along the road, two white vans are parked near buildings, while majestic snow-capped mountains rise in the distant background, framed by forested slopes to the left and a steep rocky face to the right.

The person with the red backpack remains largely stationary throughout the subsequent frames. In the final frame, a dark car appears from the left, driving rightwards along the road, positioned behind the person.
