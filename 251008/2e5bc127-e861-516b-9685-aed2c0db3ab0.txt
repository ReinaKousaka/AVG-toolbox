A black BMW SUV is directly in front of the viewer on a road with yellow pedestrian stripes, curving right into a city scene featuring several tall, reflective buildings, a green traffic light on the upper left, and another on the right. To the right, a parking lot with cars and a building displaying "STARHILL GALLERY" and "DECATHLON" signs are visible, while trees line the road's left and center median.
end of description
The BMW SUV gradually moves forward, increasing its distance from the viewer, while the green traffic light on the right dims or turns off. Simultaneously, several billboards in the median to the right of the road illuminate with dynamic orange and yellow displays, revealing more content along the curving road as the viewpoint slowly advances.

The first frame captures a city street curving right, with a black SUV in the immediate left foreground and tall buildings on both sides. A cluster of trees with two illuminated orange signs stands in the central midground, separating the road from a large reflective building on the right displaying "SHOPPES AT FOUR SEASONS PLACE" and a "DECATHLON" sign.
end of description
As the viewpoint advances, the black SUV moves out of frame to the left, revealing more of the sidewalk and buildings on that side. The reflective building on the right becomes clearer, showcasing the 'SHOPPES' sign more prominently, while the road ahead and objects within the scene appear to move closer.

In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on a grey asphalt road with double white dashed lines in the center and solid white lines marking the shoulders, curving gently ahead. To the immediate left, an urban building features a covered entrance and scaffolding above, with orange traffic cones on the pavement. A dense row of green trees fills the midground, behind which tall skyscrapers are visible, while a large digital billboard displaying an orange advertisement stands on the right, surrounded by foliage.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the building on the left, revealing more of the "SEPHORA" storefront, to appear closer and shift towards the left. Simultaneously, the large digital billboard on the right dynamically changes its advertisement content, transitioning from an orange ad to one featuring a man's portrait with a heart symbol. The road's curve to the right becomes more apparent as the scene progresses, while another smaller digital screen partially visible between the trees on the right also cycles through different displays.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a two-lane asphalt road with white markings, gently curving to the left, extending directly in front of the viewer. To the immediate left stands a modern glass-fronted building, partially revealing a "SEPHORA" sign, while to the right, large, leafy trees line a raised, vegetated median, with a distant white structure visible behind them. end of description. As the viewpoint moves forward, the "SEPHORA" sign on the left becomes fully visible, and a row of orange cones appears on the sidewalk adjacent to it. Concurrently, further down the road on the left, a previously obscured traffic light changes from green to yellow. Simultaneously, on the right, a yellow sign, initially hidden behind the trees in the mid-ground, gradually emerges into view closer to the white background structure.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a paved road with white dashed lines curves slightly left from the viewer's foreground into the mid-ground. To the viewer's left, a tall building with "SEPHORA" visible on its facade stands alongside a sidewalk with several orange traffic cones; further left are some trees. To the viewer's right, a dense canopy of trees lines the road, obscuring a white building in the background, with lush greenery along the roadside and a partially visible circular sign under the trees.

end of description

As the viewpoint progresses forward, an orange banner-like object becomes fully visible on the right, initially bare and then revealing a face as it moves towards the foreground. Simultaneously, objects on the left (building, cones) and right (trees, white building) recede, while the distant traffic lights ahead on the left become clearer and a person on a bicycle appears in the distant center, approaching the viewer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a road with dashed white lines extending from the viewer into the distance, bordered on the left by a sidewalk with parked motorcycles and a modern curved building, and on the right by a treed median and large trees. Ahead, an overhead bridge spans the road, revealing a cyclist and distant buildings under an overcast sky, with green and red traffic lights visible in the far distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the overhead bridge with its "Decathlon" sign becomes more distinct in the center-distance, while the cyclist advances closer and slightly to the left of the initial position. The foreground motorcycles on the left gradually recede from view as the scene moves forward, and the distant buildings become slightly clearer.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a view down a multi-lane asphalt road, marked with white dashed lines and a double yellow line on the far left. To the immediate left, a sidewalk with trees parallels the road, backed by tall buildings displaying colorful neon signs, while to the right, a lush green median with dense foliage and trees also lines the road. In the mid-distance, a cyclist is positioned centrally, moving away towards a pedestrian bridge spanning the road, which features a "DECATHLON" sign. Green traffic lights are visible beneath the bridge to both the left and right, with tall skyscrapers rising in the background against an overcast sky.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses forward, causing the white road markings to elongate and new yellow directional arrows (a left turn, a straight, and a straight/right turn) to appear on the road surface ahead. Concurrently, the cyclist moves further away, eventually passing under the Decathlon bridge. A pedestrian appears on the left sidewalk, walking away from the viewer, while other background elements subtly grow larger due to the forward motion.
