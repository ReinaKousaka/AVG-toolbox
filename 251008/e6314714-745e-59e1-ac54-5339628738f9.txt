The first frame displays a heavily superimposed or double-exposed aerial view of a city, likely Venice, characterized by numerous buildings with reddish-brown terracotta roofs densely packed on both sides of a wide central canal. The canal flows from the bottom-center towards the top-center, with several indistinct boats appearing as blurred shapes on its surface, and a large, ornate white building is prominent on the bottom-left bank. The entire scene appears translucent and dreamlike, with the sky barely visible above the distant rooftops.

The initial ghosted scene clarifies into a sharp aerial view of the Grand Canal, with the surrounding buildings now distinct. A white motorboat appears in the center-right of the canal, moving away from the viewer towards the background, leaving a visible wake. Subsequently, a smaller white boat with an orange hull emerges at the bottom-right, moving towards the frame's edge. Throughout the sequence, the main motorboat steadily progresses further up the canal, becoming more distant, while a large white building with an arched entrance on the left bank becomes increasingly clearer and more central to the left side as the scene unfolds.

An aerial view presents a wide canal flanked by dense rows of buildings, predominantly topped with red-tiled roofs, stretching into the distance under an overcast sky. In the mid-ground on the left, a large white building with arched windows is partially covered by scaffolding, while a powerboat moves away in the canal's lower right, leaving a prominent wake.

The camera slowly pans left and slightly backward relative to the initial viewpoint, progressively revealing more of the white building and the structures immediately to its left. Concurrently, a "FRYOPOLIS" watermark fades into view on the lower left of the expanding frame, and the powerboat continues its movement down the canal, receding further into the distance.
