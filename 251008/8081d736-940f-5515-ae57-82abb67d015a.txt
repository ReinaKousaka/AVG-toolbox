The first frame shows a wet city square at night, with two figures in the foreground, their backs to the viewer, standing on a reflective pavement near a yellow sign on the right. Bare trees adorned with bright vertical white string lights dominate the midground, with various buildings in the background and a light cylindrical object hovering in the top left.

In the subsequent frames, the two figures in the foreground slowly walk forward and slightly to the left, moving deeper into the plaza relative to the initial viewpoint. This progression gradually reveals more of the plaza's wet ground, benches, and bins previously obscured to the left and center. A white van also becomes visible further along the street to the far right, past the stone building, as the scene slowly pans.
