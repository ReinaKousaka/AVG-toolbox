In the first frame, a large, dark wooden traditional building, elevated on numerous columns, dominates the midground left, situated behind a patch of green plants and a small tree in the immediate foreground. To the right, a stone-paved path extends into the distance, bordered by a narrow water channel in the center and another traditional building with a tiled roof along the far right edge, with distant figures and additional buildings visible under an overcast sky.

The viewpoint slowly advances forward and slightly to the left across the frames. This gradual shift causes the large wooden building on the left to move further left relative to the frame, revealing more of its right side and the area directly behind it from the initial perspective. Simultaneously, the small tree in the foreground left also shifts leftward within the frame, and distant objects along the path appear slightly closer.

The first frame displays a large, dark wooden two-story traditional building on stilts centrally, extending towards the right, with a traditional curved roof. To the left foreground, a tree with sparse green leaves grows beside a grassy area and a small canal featuring stone steps. A stone pathway runs from the lower right foreground into the distance, lined on its right by more traditional buildings, where a few people walk and red lanterns hang further back.
end of description
The camera slowly pans right, causing the prominent wooden building to shift left within the frame, progressively revealing more of its right side and the details beneath it. As the pan continues, the tree on the far left of the initial view moves further left out of the frame. Simultaneously, new segments of the pathway and additional distant buildings that were originally located to the right of the first frame's view become visible on the right side.

The first frame displays a large, dark wooden two-story traditional Chinese pavilion, supported by numerous pillars, positioned centrally and to the right of the viewer. To its left, a tree with green foliage is partially visible, while further left and slightly behind, another smaller traditional building with a red decoration and a large circular object is seen. In the foreground, green grass occupies the bottom-left, and a narrow water channel with stone steps runs from the bottom-right towards the center. Overcast sky covers the top, and more traditional structures are visible in the distant background.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly pans right, causing the tree initially on the far left to gradually move further left and out of the frame. Simultaneously, the smaller traditional building on the mid-left becomes more fully revealed, showcasing its entrance and the large circular object inside more clearly. No new significant objects enter the scene from the right relative to the first frame; instead, elements on the far right of the initial view continue moving out of sight.
