The first frame displays a park-like area featuring dense green foliage and some orange flowers in the foreground and mid-ground, bordering a wet paved path curving towards the viewer's right. Several trees are interspersed within the greenery, while a large building with a brown roof and spires stands in the background to the center-left, and a partial stone building is visible to the far right, all under a transparent overlay of a 'VERBOT' sign and a graffiti-covered box. end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint gradually pans right and forward; the red 'VERBOT' sign on a pole and a white utility box with graffiti become fully visible on the viewer's right, then move out of frame as the pan continues. Simultaneously, the paved path on the left and the background buildings to the center-left become clearer, and a new silver cylindrical object appears in the mid-ground left, shifting further left as the scene progresses.

In the first frame, a wet, paved path curves along the left, bordered by a tall, silver cylindrical object. To the right, a dense patch of green vegetation with a low wooden fence extends towards two visible tree trunks on the far right. In the background, a large light-colored building with a brown roof and multiple spires is centered, while more green trees obscure a building on the right. end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward and right. The silver cylindrical object on the left transforms into a long, curved, slatted bench, revealing its full extent relative to the initial position. Simultaneously, a prominent yellow-brown tower, part of the building previously obscured by trees on the right, emerges further into view on the right side of the frame. The foreground vegetation also shows slight movement, indicating dynamic changes.

In the first frame, a wet paved path stretches from the left foreground, curving towards the middle, with a long, light wooden slatted bench running parallel to it on the right. To the right of the bench is a vibrant garden featuring green foliage and scattered white and purple flowers, behind which stands a large stone building with a prominent tower topped by a greenish-brown spire. Further in the background to the left, another building with a brown roof is visible under a partly cloudy sky.

Subsequently, the view subtly shifts slightly forward and to the right, maintaining the overall scene. As the frames progress, a large, light-colored flower with a dark center becomes more clearly visible within the garden's foliage, positioned to the right of the lamppost and in front of the stone building relative to the initial viewpoint.
