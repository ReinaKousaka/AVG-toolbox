The first frame presents a city street scene from a sidewalk perspective, with a couple walking away from the viewer on the right side of the sidewalk and another man further left on the sidewalk also receding. To the left, a street carries vehicles away, while buildings with storefronts on the right and taller structures on the left frame a traffic light with a pedestrian signal overhead.

As the frames progress, the couple and the lone man continue walking further away from the first-frame viewpoint down the sidewalk. Concurrently, the black pickup truck and silver car on the street also move further away to the left. A person in a red hoodie, initially partially visible to the far right near a green pole, gradually moves further away and sits on a low ledge to the right of the couple, becoming more defined.

In the first frame, a couple with the man's arm around the woman's shoulder walks away from the viewer on the right side of a city sidewalk. To the left foreground, a black trash can is visible next to several white trash bags piled on the sidewalk. Further left and behind, a green utility box, a street lamp with a "walk" signal, and a newsstand are present, with a black pickup truck on the street behind them. Along the right, storefronts line the street, while numerous pedestrians walk further down the sidewalk into the midground.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the foreground couple on the right and the trash can and bags on the left to move out of the frame. The green utility box, street lamp, and newsstand on the left also recede and move out of view, revealing more of the street and buildings in the background. The black pickup truck on the left drives forward on the street, and new sections of the storefronts and building facades on the right become visible as the scene progresses.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward; the two foreground individuals (viewer's perspective) walk along the sidewalk. The two men in the midground continue walking away, receding further down the street, while the man on the left, wearing a blue cap, passes the newsstand and walks towards the viewer's left. The black pickup truck gradually moves out of view to the left, and more of the street and distant buildings are revealed ahead.

The man in the blue cap and black mask moves out of the frame to the left, revealing more of the street and the parked pickup truck behind him. Concurrently, the couple in the right foreground walks further away, becoming smaller and revealing more of the "NAIL & SPA Cleo" sign on the building to their right. Other pedestrians in the midground continue to walk further into the distance, appearing smaller relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

In the first frame, the back of a person in a brown jacket and grey beanie occupies the foreground right, facing away from the viewer. To the mid-ground left, a newsstand displays snacks and magazines, with a digital advertisement visible just behind it. A man in a blue sweater walks away from the viewer in the mid-ground center, with a woman in a green jacket behind him to the right. The scene extends into an alleyway lined with buildings, revealing food carts further down the street.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the alley. The person in the brown jacket moves out of view to the right, while the man and woman continue walking further away into the background. More of the storefront on the right, including outdoor seating, becomes visible, revealing a cafe called "FLOW COFFEE" to the right of the first-frame viewpoint. The newsstand on the left recedes as the viewer advances, and the food carts in the mid-ground appear closer.

In the first frame, a newsstand displaying snacks and magazines is visible on the foreground left. To its right, a tall digital kiosk with a colorful abstract display stands alongside a silver food cart. Two pedestrians, a man in a dark blue jacket and a woman in a green puffy jacket, walk away from the viewer down the sidewalk, with tall city buildings in the background to the left and storefronts like "le caf√© COFFEE" on the right.
end of description
As the frames progress, both the man and woman continue walking further away from the first-frame viewpoint along the sidewalk. Simultaneously, a black SUV with its trunk open progressively pulls forward from behind the digital kiosk on the left, revealing its loaded interior as it moves further into the street. Other pedestrians near the food cart on the left also shift their positions slightly.

In the first frame, a LinkNYC kiosk with a colorful abstract display and a black trash bag are on the ground to the far left, next to the open trunk of a dark SUV. A silver food cart stands to the right of the kiosk, with a man in a dark hoodie facing it. Two individuals, a man in a blue sweater and a person in a green jacket, walk away from the viewer in the center. To the right, storefronts for "le cafe COFFEE" and "SPICE Hair Salon" feature small outdoor tables and chairs, while tall buildings line the street in the background.

end of description

The two individuals continue walking away from the viewer, moving further down the sidewalk. The man at the food cart remains largely stationary while interacting with it. As the viewpoint advances forward, a coffee shop sign is revealed and moves into the mid-ground right. The LinkNYC kiosk and SUV in the foreground shift out of view, and the food cart becomes more prominent on the left as the scene progresses forward.
