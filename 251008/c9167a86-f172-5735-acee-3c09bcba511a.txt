The first frame shows a downward-sloping stone staircase, partially shaded, leading away from the viewer into a lush green environment. To the viewer's immediate left and right, and along the path, are dense green bushes adorned with numerous light blue hydrangea flowers, with some prominent in the bottom left and right foreground. A person wearing a light-colored top, dark pants, and a backpack is visible on the steps in the midground, walking away from the viewer, partially obscured by the right-side foliage. Beyond the steps, the background is dominated by a dense canopy of various green trees under a bright sky.

The person walks continuously down the stone steps, moving further away from the initial viewpoint. As they descend, more of the path and sun-dappled steps below them are revealed. The surrounding green foliage and blue hydrangeas remain largely static, framing the receding figure, who eventually turns slightly left, continuing their journey down the path away from the viewer.

The first frame displays a sun-drenched concrete pathway winding into the distance, curving slightly to the right. Lush green foliage, featuring vibrant blue hydrangeas, frames both sides of the path, with some leaves extending into the immediate foreground on the left and right. In the midground, a person wearing a hat, light top, dark pants, and a backpack walks away from the viewer along the path, positioned slightly right of center. Wooden posts delineate the path's left edge. Dense green trees and sunlit foliage fill the background, ascending a hillside.

The initial person continues to walk further away from the viewer along the path. Subsequently, a second person, also walking away from the viewer, emerges further down the path, positioned to the left and slightly behind the first individual. Both figures progressively move deeper into the distance relative to the static first-frame viewpoint.
