In the first frame, two men wearing dark winter coats are in the foreground, slightly to the left, walking towards the viewer in a paved alleyway. To their immediate left, a building with large illuminated display windows and a bright yellow overhead sign marks a commercial establishment, extending into the mid-ground. Further down the alley, more glowing signs and building lights are visible, with tall dark structures defining the background. On the right side of the alley, stacked beverage crates are positioned in the foreground, next to a plain, tall wall that stretches into the distance, possibly a construction barrier.
end of description
The two men in the foreground continue walking past the viewer's left side and are fully out of frame by frame 7. Concurrently, a third man, initially in the mid-ground walking towards the viewer, approaches and by frame 4, he pulls out a phone, which he looks at as he walks past the viewer towards the left foreground. Other figures in the distant background continue to move subtly along the alley.

The first frame presents an illuminated night alleyway stretching ahead of the viewer. To the immediate left, a wooden-paneled building with multiple glowing signs is partially obscured by a blurry person in the foreground. To the right, a tall corrugated wall extends along the alley, which features a tiled pavement with a projected yellow circular light in the mid-ground. Further ahead, a group of people walks under more city lights and distant buildings.
end of description
Subsequently, the blurry person quickly moves out of view to the left, fully revealing the building's facade and stairs. The viewpoint subtly progresses forward, making the side buildings recede slightly and the group of people move further down the alley, away from the first-frame viewpoint.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a narrow alleyway at night, illuminated by various signs. To the viewer's left, a building with a wooden facade displays multiple illuminated signs with Korean text, above a set of stairs where beer crates are visible. Directly ahead, several pedestrians walk away from the viewer on the paved ground, which features a distinct green circular projection. To the viewer's right, a plain, light-colored construction barrier or wall extends into the distance. In the background, brightly lit city buildings and numerous neon signs mark a bustling street beyond the alley.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward into the alley. The wooden building on the left and the construction barrier on the right reveal more of their respective facades as they approach the viewer, passing to the sides of the original first-frame viewpoint. The pedestrians originally in the middle ground move further into the distance, away from the initial viewpoint, while other individuals are revealed walking towards the viewer from deeper within the alley. The green circular projection on the ground moves from the middle ground to the foreground, eventually passing beneath the first-frame viewpoint. The distant city street and its illuminated buildings appear increasingly closer and larger relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a narrow, brightly lit city street at night, viewed from a pedestrian's perspective looking forward. On the left, a bustling restaurant entrance with large windows and glowing signs, including a prominent red one, recedes into the midground, while a plain light-colored building wall with debris at its base occupies the right side. In the midground, a group of people walk towards the viewer, passing over a glowing green circular pattern projected onto the ground in the foreground, with distant buildings and numerous neon signs illuminating the background.

end of description
Through subsequent frames, the viewer's perspective subtly advances into the street. The group of people steadily approaches the viewer from the midground, becoming larger and closer, while the glowing green pattern on the ground appears to recede as the viewer moves forward.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a nighttime city street with numerous pedestrians. To the left, a brightly lit storefront with large glass windows and various Korean signs extends into the midground. In the left foreground, several men walk towards the viewer, including one in a black coat and another in a white graphic t-shirt. On the right, a man in a black jacket walks away from the viewer, partially obscuring a tall, light-colored wall adorned with posters and yellow barriers at its base. In the background, the street continues, flanked by illuminated buildings and neon signs, with more distant pedestrians.

end of description

As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward through the street. The men initially in the left foreground pass by the viewer to the left, while the man on the right continues moving away from the viewer, exiting the frame to the right. New pedestrians are continuously revealed walking towards the viewer from further down the street, emerging from the space ahead of the first-frame viewpoint. The architecture of the storefronts on the left and the wall on the right progressively approaches the viewer as the perspective advances down the street.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a bustling nighttime city street with two pedestrians in the immediate left foreground, a prominent vertical sign to their left, and illuminated storefronts extending into the midground. On the right, a white wall with posters and yellow barriers borders a narrow street leading to distant buildings adorned with neon signs and parked cars.
end of description
Subsequently, the foreground pedestrians and the large sign exit the left side as the viewer advances, revealing more storefronts and a blue crate stack on the left. Simultaneously, the white wall on the right recedes, exposing additional yellow barriers, a red hydrant, parked vehicles, and red trash bags further down the street on the right, all relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a bustling urban alleyway at night. To the viewer's immediate left, a person in dark clothing stands with their back mostly turned, adjacent to a brightly lit storefront with awnings and blue crates on the sidewalk. Further down this left sidewalk, another person in a brown jacket walks away from the viewer. On the right, a concrete pillar/wall covered with posters is in the foreground, with red trash bags at its base, while parked dark cars line the street, behind which a person stands stationary. The alley extends into the distance with multiple illuminated buildings and signs on both sides, and other pedestrians are visible further down.
end of description
The person in dark clothing on the far left progressively moves out of frame to the left, while the person in the brown jacket on the mid-left continually walks deeper into the scene along the sidewalk. From the deep background, a person in a white top gradually moves closer to the viewer on the left side of the street. Later, another person in black appears from behind the blue crates on the mid-left sidewalk, also walking towards the viewer. All other visible elements, including the parked cars, buildings, and the stationary person on the mid-right, remain fixed in their initial positions.
