In the foreground right, a white column connects to a stacked stone wall, while centrally positioned, a grand wooden spiral staircase with dark balusters curves upwards and to the left. To the background left, an open doorway reveals a brightly lit room with a window, and to the background right, an archway leads to another space where a round mirror is visible on a far wall.

The viewpoint slowly pans right and slightly zooms in, causing the central staircase to appear to shift left within the frame. The foreground stone wall and column on the right recede, revealing more of the living/dining area to the right and deeper, including a table, chairs, and a large window with a pendant light. Simultaneously, the view through the left doorway expands to the left, revealing more of that room, including a second doorway and a prominent window.
