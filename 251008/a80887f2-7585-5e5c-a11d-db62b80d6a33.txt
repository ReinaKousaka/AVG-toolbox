In the first frame, the viewer faces a city street scene. The immediate foreground shows a paved ground with light and dark grey sections and faint yellow markings. Towards the right, a person in a dark brown coat and black mask stands facing away from the viewer. Slightly to the left and closer, a woman in a dark puffer coat, black mask, and shoulder bag stands facing the viewer. To her left, a woman in a lighter brown coat and white mask stands, and further left, a man in a blue jacket and blue mask walks away towards the left. On the far left, a woman in a reddish-brown coat is also walking left. Behind the walking man, a dark blue SUV is parked. Buildings line the background, including a multi-story building on the left with illuminated signs and a vertical green garden, and a smaller central building with '임대' (for rent) signs, behind which a white SUV is parked. Taller buildings and additional signs in Korean are visible behind and between these structures.

end of description

From the initial viewpoint, the woman in the reddish-brown coat and the man in the blue jacket on the far left continue walking further left, slowly exiting the frame. The woman in the lighter brown coat, initially left of the central figure, turns and begins walking towards the right of the scene, moving away from the viewer's original position. A yellow scooter is progressively revealed on the ground to the left of the central woman's initial stance, becoming fully visible. Finally, a man on a green bicycle emerges from behind the brown barrier on the far left, cycling further left relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
