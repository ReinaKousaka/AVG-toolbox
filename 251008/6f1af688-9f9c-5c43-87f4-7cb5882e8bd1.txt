The first frame captures a rainy village scene featuring two prominent, dark-wood chalet-style buildings framing a wet asphalt road with yellow markings in the foreground. The left building has a stone foundation and a wooden fence, while the right features flower-filled balconies and two flags; a blue car is parked between them in the mid-ground, with misty green mountains rising across the entire background.

The camera subtly pulls back and pans left, progressively revealing a beige garage door on the far left, attached to the structure adjacent to the left building, as the rightmost building slowly shifts towards the edge of the frame. The rain continues to fall across the entire scene, maintaining a consistent atmosphere.
