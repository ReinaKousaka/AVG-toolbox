The viewer is positioned on an asphalt road, looking forward into a valley. To the immediate left, a solid white line borders the road, followed by a dark, segmented rock retaining wall, above which a steep grassy hillside rises, secured by a wire fence and covered with dense green trees. Ahead on the road, a dashed white line marks the center, leading to a gentle right curve in the mid-ground. To the right of the road, a metal guardrail runs parallel, beyond which train tracks are visible, flanked by more dense green trees covering a mountain slope, with overhead power lines supported by poles. The background reveals a bright, hazy sky between the towering, tree-covered mountain slopes.

As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the rock wall, grassy slope, and fence on the left, and the guardrail and train tracks on the right, progressively move closer and recede past the viewer. The road continues to curve gently to the right, revealing more of the path ahead within the mountain valley. No entirely new scenes or objects from different spatial directions are introduced; rather, the existing environment continuously unfolds as the viewer progresses.

The first frame depicts a paved road curving gently to the left and extending into the distance from the viewer's forward position, with a rocky retention wall rising steeply immediately to the viewer's left. To the right of the road, a metal guardrail runs parallel, bordering railroad tracks on a gravel bed, beyond which a dense, forested mountain slope rises into the background. Utility poles with overhead wires line the right side of the road, and the sky, bright with early or late sunlight, is visible at the top.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the curving road, the sun emerges from behind the mountain face to the upper left of the first-frame viewpoint, casting strong light and glare onto the road ahead. Subsequently, a dark vehicle comes into view, appearing on the road ahead, approaching from around the curve to the left of the original path.
