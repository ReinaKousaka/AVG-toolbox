The first frame shows a wet, dimly lit street at night, looking down a narrow urban lane. To the viewer's left, a building houses a brightly lit shop with large glass windows and a prominent red and white sign above, alongside a food poster. On the viewer's right, the front part of a silver car is visible, followed by three orange traffic cones and another building with large, vertically segmented windows. In the foreground and extending into the midground, a wet street features a yellow and white striped pedestrian crossing and a white arrow pointing forward. Further down the street, more buildings with glowing signs line both sides, receding into a hazy, dark background.
end of description
Subsequent frames depict a continuous, slow forward movement of the viewpoint along the wet street. This motion progressively reveals more of the road and distant illuminated buildings *further ahead* from the initial position. Concurrently, immediate foreground elements like the silver car on the viewer's right gradually recede and occupy less of the frame. The white arrow road marking, initially in the midground, effectively moves towards the viewer's position, and a faint 'C28' road marking is newly revealed *on the right side of the street, beyond the initial car's position*, as the viewpoint advances.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a wet, nighttime street scene with a multi-story building featuring storefronts and two parked bicycles on the left, and a lower building with garage-style doors and three orange traffic cones on the right sidewalk. A white arrow is painted on the wet street, pointing towards the viewer, reflecting the colorful neon lights from shops lining the street in the distance.
end of description
A person then emerges from behind the bicycles on the left sidewalk, walking towards the viewer before moving past the bicycles and out of the frame towards the left foreground.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame shows a wet, narrow city street at night, extending into the distance under a dark sky. In the foreground, a white arrow and an 'X' are painted on the asphalt, with a light-colored bicycle leaning on the left sidewalk and two orange traffic cones on the right sidewalk. Buildings line both sides: on the left, a multi-story structure with glowing signs and a food poster; on the right, a building with glass-paned sections and an overhead light. Parked cars are visible further down the street.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the initial bicycle and traffic cones on the left and right recede and move out of frame. The white arrow and 'X' on the asphalt disappear, replaced by yellow numbers "16-28-05" appearing on the right side of the street. Subsequently, the buildings lining both sides become closer, revealing more facade details, and the parked cars further down the street become more distinct.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A wet asphalt street extends into the distance, reflecting neon signs and streetlights. To the viewer's immediate left stands a building with white storefronts and two illuminated signs; a bicycle is parked against its base. The right side features a building with large glass windows, and further down the street on both sides, more buildings, parked cars, and glowing signs are visible under a dark night sky. An orange traffic cone is near the viewer's far right, and white road markings are on the wet pavement.
end of description
The "스타 노래 연습장" neon sign on the building to the viewer's left cycles through various lighting patterns, changing its hue between green, blue, and red. All other objects and their positions relative to the first-frame viewpoint remain static. In the final frame, a translucent umbrella is newly revealed, appearing directly above the viewer and partially obscuring the upper portion of the scene.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a wet, illuminated street at night, seen from beneath a blurry, translucent object, likely an umbrella, occupying the top portion of the view. Directly in front, white Korean characters are partially visible on the asphalt. To the left, a building features a prominent neon sign with green and red Korean text ('스타 노래 연습장') bordered by vibrant blue lights, with other storefronts extending down the street. On the right, a brick building with large glass windows shows items inside, and closer to the viewer, a wooden pallet holds blue objects and a bicycle on the sidewalk. The street recedes into the distance, reflecting numerous artificial lights from buildings and distant vehicle taillights.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward, slightly right, and subtly downward relative to the first-frame viewpoint. Consequently, the blurry overhead umbrella recedes, and the white Korean characters ('정지' for Stop) on the asphalt directly in front become entirely visible and closer to the bottom. A yellow line on the left side of the street and the lower section of blue lights on the left building's neon sign are progressively revealed as the viewer advances. The bicycle and pallet on the right, initially partially visible, become more fully framed relative to their starting positions.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The viewer stands on a wet, reflective asphalt street at night, looking down a narrow urban lane flanked by buildings. To the immediate left, a low white wall precedes a building with a prominent green neon sign displaying Korean text ("연습장") and an awning strung with lights, where bicycles are parked behind a wooden barrier. On the right, closer to the viewer, a storefront with large glass windows is visible, next to a wooden pallet holding a blue object and a black bicycle. Further down the street, various buildings with illuminated signs, parked cars, and overhead utility poles extend into the distance under a dark sky.
end of description
Between the second and third frames, the large neon sign on the upper left of the building changes color from green to blue, remaining blue thereafter. Simultaneously, the yellow road markings previously visible on the wet street towards the bottom right of the first-frame viewpoint transition into white markings. No other significant objects or scenes are newly revealed or disappear relative to the initial frame.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a wet city street at night, reflecting vibrant lights from buildings lining both sides. On the left, a restaurant glows with string lights, featuring two parked bicycles and a 'No Smoking' sign. To the right, a storefront displays items, with a scooter and a blue tarp-covered object on a pallet in the foreground.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, the scene remains largely static, with only subtle shifts in the viewpoint until frame 8, where a wet, clear umbrella appears in the upper right foreground, suggesting the viewer is now moving under cover from rain.
