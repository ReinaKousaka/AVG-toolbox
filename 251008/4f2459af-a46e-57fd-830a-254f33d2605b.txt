frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame displays a paved road curving gently to the right in the distance, flanked by dense evergreen forests on rising embankments. The viewer is positioned slightly left of the road's center, which features a solid white line on the left, a dashed yellow line centrally, and a solid white line on the right, with prominent red rectangular markings in the mid-foreground. Overlaid graphics show a speedometer (24 km/h), altitude (1798 m), coordinates, and a winding route indicator on the bottom and top right.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the road, causing the red marked sections to recede under the frame. A small triangular road sign emerges further ahead on the left side, where a pole was initially visible. The dense evergreen trees and rising embankments on both sides appear to draw closer and then pass the viewer. The displayed speed fluctuates between 24 and 23 km/h, and the coordinates update subtly. In the later frames, a "WALK CHINA" logo appears in the bottom-left corner of the screen.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
A paved road with a yellow center line extends forward, curving slightly right, flanked by dense evergreen trees under an overcast sky; a guardrail and a triangular warning sign are on the left, while a red object sits in the immediate foreground, along with various HUD overlays indicating speed (24 km/h), coordinates, and altitude.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, new sections of the road and forested landscape are continuously revealed ahead, beyond the first-frame's horizon. The trees and guardrail, initially in the midground, progressively move past the viewer and recede towards the background. The red object in the immediate foreground remains, becoming slightly less prominent as the perspective shifts, and the speed displayed incrementally increases from 24 to 26 km/h. Finally, a new cluster of warning signs emerges further down the road, appearing ahead of the furthest point visible in the first frame.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, the viewer looks straight down a wet, two-lane asphalt road that gently curves to the right in the distance, bordered by dense green trees on both sides under an overcast sky. A blue guardrail extends along both sides of the road, with a white triangular warning sign visible on the left and yellow-and-black striped caution markers on the right. Overlaid onto the lower right are a speedometer showing 26 km/h and GPS coordinates, while the top right features a winding road map, and above the road in the mid-distance, two virtual warning signs display a yellow zigzag and a red '30' speed limit.
end of description
As the vehicle moves forward, the road, blue guardrails, and trees recede from the mid-distance towards and then past the viewer. Concurrently, the virtual warning signs, initially showing a zigzag and '30', are joined by additional red circular signs (one with an arrow, one with Chinese characters), all approaching from the mid-distance and eventually ascending off the top of the frame. The speedometer display in the bottom right changes, indicating an increase in speed from 26 to 28 km/h, while a "CHINA Full HD" watermark at the bottom left becomes more pronounced.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a wet asphalt road with a yellow dashed centerline, extending from directly in front of the viewer and curving gently to the right into the distance. Blue guardrails run along both sides of the road, bordered by dense, tall green trees under an overcast sky, with distant trees visible further ahead. On-screen elements at the bottom show a speed of 28 km/h, GPS coordinates, and an altitude of 1798 meters, while a miniature map of a winding road is in the top right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road, causing the road surface, guardrails, and flanking trees to continuously recede from the foreground towards and then behind the viewer. The vehicle's speed increases to 29 km/h in the second frame, maintaining this speed as it continues to navigate the winding road through the dense forest ahead. The overall mountainous forest landscape remains visible in the distance as the journey unfolds.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a wet asphalt road extending forward into the distance, with a dashed yellow line down the center and a solid white line on the left. Bright blue guardrails run along the left and right edges of the road, behind which dense green trees form a tall, continuous wall on both sides, all beneath an overcast white sky. Overlaid in the bottom right are digital readouts showing 29 km/h, GPS coordinates, and an altitude of 1798m with an elevation graph, while a winding route map is in the top right, and a logo appears in the bottom left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the winding road, which continues to curve gently to the right relative to its initial path, revealing more of the forest road ahead. The dense trees and blue guardrails on both sides of the road recede from the viewer's left and right, with new sections constantly appearing from further ahead, maintaining their lateral positions. Concurrently, the displayed speed increases from 29 km/h to 31 km/h, and the GPS coordinates subtly update, reflecting the continuous forward movement on the superimposed map.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a wet, dark asphalt road with a dashed yellow center line and solid white edge lines stretches away from the viewer, curving slightly to the right in the distance. Blue guardrails run along both sides of the road, closer to the viewer. Beyond these, a dense forest of tall, green and brown trees lines both sides of the road, extending into the midground and background under an overcast, light grey sky. Overlayed in the foreground are digital displays: a speedometer showing "31 km/h" and a yellow dial at the bottom center, GPS coordinates, "1798 m" altitude, and an elevation profile at the bottom right, and a winding route map at the top right. A "RALLY CHINA" logo appears at the bottom left.
end of description
The vehicle proceeds forward, causing the wet asphalt, blue guardrails, and dense forest lining both sides to continuously shift from ahead of the viewer towards the sides and then recede past the first-frame viewpoint. The road's curve to the right in the mid-distance steadily approaches. Concurrently, the displayed speed increases from 31 km/h to 32 km/h, and the GPS coordinates and altitude readings update to reflect the ongoing journey.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame presents a view from a vehicle on a wet asphalt road, featuring a yellow double solid line down its center and blue guardrails on both sides, extending towards a gentle right curve in the distance. Dense evergreen trees and shrubs cover the mountainous slopes flanking the road under an overcast sky. Overlaid elements include a 'RALLY CHINA' logo on the bottom left, and on the bottom right, a speed of 32 km/h, GPS coordinates, an elevation of 1798 m, and a small track map icon at the top right.
end of description
As the vehicle moves forward, the road and surrounding forested slopes progress towards the viewer, with the guardrails and trees on both sides passing by from the front towards the sides. The displayed speed gradually increases from 32 km/h to 34 km/h, and the GPS coordinates subtly update, reflecting the continuous travel along the winding mountain road.
