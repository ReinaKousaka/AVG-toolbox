In the first frame, a partial white delivery truck is visible on the far left, with a man in a blue shirt standing at its rear. To his right and slightly behind, two black trash cans are present, while a line of parked cars extends further down the street on the left. A sidewalk stretches towards the background, featuring a tree, a street sign to its left, and pedestrians walking away further down the path. On the right, a green subway entrance railing with a 'Subway' sign and a matching lamppost are visible, next to storefronts with red awnings occupying the mid-ground to background right.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly moves forward and slightly to the right along the sidewalk. The white delivery truck, the man, and the trash cans, initially in the foreground left, progressively recede and move out of the frame to the left of the original viewpoint. As these elements disappear, more parked cars on the left, previously further down the street, come into clearer view. Concurrently, the subway entrance and storefronts on the right, initially at the frame's edge, become more centrally positioned and expanded within the frame, revealing areas previously further right from the initial view.

The first frame displays an urban street, featuring parked cars on the left foreground with two black trash cans and a dark SUV. A street pole and tree separate the parked cars from a sidewalk on the right, where a green metal railing is visible and several pedestrians walk away past storefronts, including a "CASEY BAGEL COFFEE" shop.

Subsequently, a person emerges from behind the green railing on the far right, stepping onto the sidewalk near the storefront. This individual then interacts with their phone, bringing it to their ear, while the railing gradually moves out of frame to the right, revealing more of the storefront.

The first frame displays an urban street scene with a sidewalk on the right and a street with parked cars on the left. On the immediate right, a man in a black cap and jacket stands on the sidewalk, holding a phone to his ear, with a store facade and a partially closed security gate behind him. A leafy tree in a metal grate stands in the mid-ground on the sidewalk, while a line of parked cars, including a silver sedan with a damaged front and a yellow vest on its hood, occupies the left side of the frame. Further down the sidewalk, several pedestrians walk away from the viewer, with multi-story buildings visible in the background on both sides.
end of description
As the video progresses, the man on the right lowers his phone, then turns and walks out of the frame to the right. Simultaneously, the group of pedestrians on the mid-ground sidewalk continues moving further away from the viewer down the street.

In the first frame, a city sidewalk stretches from the bottom center into the distance, with a light-colored sedan partially visible on the far left. A tree trunk stands in the center-left foreground, partially obscuring parked cars lining the street to its left. On the right, storefronts with awnings and display windows run along the sidewalk, while several pedestrians walk away from the viewer towards the background. In the background, buildings with "Verizon" signage are visible on the left, and distant scaffolding can be seen further down the street.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly moves forward and slightly to the right, revealing more of the sidewalk and storefronts on the right side, including a clearer view of a sign reading "Doux Noir". The tree trunk shifts further left, allowing more parked cars on the left side of the street to become visible. The pedestrians continue moving away from the viewer along the sidewalk, maintaining their positions relative to each other but appearing smaller as they recede into the distance.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a street scene with parked cars lining the left side and storefronts on the right, beneath a lush canopy of green trees. Several pedestrians are visible walking away from the viewer down the central sidewalk, towards distant buildings and construction scaffolding, while a tree trunk and a silver SUV occupy the immediate foreground left.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the pedestrians continue moving further away along the sidewalk relative to the fixed first-frame viewpoint, without any new objects or scenes becoming visible.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, the viewer observes a city sidewalk scene. On the far left, several parked cars line the curb, including a silver SUV partially visible and a dark grey SUV with a light blue bicycle parked next to it. A woman in a red top and dark patterned pants walks towards the viewer on the central sidewalk, looking down at her phone. To the right, storefronts with large display windows, one featuring a yellow logo, line the street. Overhead, green tree leaves form a canopy, and in the background, other pedestrians walk away from the viewer, with buildings and scaffolding visible further down the street.

end of description

The woman in the red top continues walking directly towards the viewer, growing larger in the frame. Around the fifth frame, she puts away her phone and begins carrying a white tote bag with blue straps on her left shoulder, shifting her gaze to look forward. She continues approaching the viewer, her face becoming more discernible, while other pedestrians in the far background move away.
