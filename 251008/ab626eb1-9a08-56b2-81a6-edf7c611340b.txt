In the first frame, the viewer is on a snowy city sidewalk looking down a street. A white minivan with "EV Roadside Assistance" on its rear is prominent in the right midground, its brake lights illuminated, next to a partially visible white SUV. A black lamppost stands in the center foreground, and bare, snow-dusted trees line the left sidewalk with buildings beyond.

As frames progress, the white minivan and the white SUV to its right move forward and slightly left, revealing more of the SUV's side. Another lighter-colored SUV appears behind them on the right, also moving forward. Snow continues to fall throughout the scene.

The first frame presents a snowy city street scene, viewed from a sidewalk alongside a building with a glass canopy extending over the pavement on the left. In the mid-ground, a white van and a white SUV are on the wet street, with a bare tree between the sidewalk and the road, and a red traffic light visible further down the street. Tall city buildings loom in the background to the right.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the red traffic light in the mid-ground changes to green. Both the white van and the white SUV on the street move forward, further away from the viewer's original position. Snow continues to fall steadily across the entire scene.

The first frame presents a snowy city street scene from a sidewalk perspective. To the viewer's left, a building facade with concrete pillars and a "FOR LEASE" sign on a window is visible, while a bare tree dusted with snow stands closer on the right side of the sidewalk. A wet, partially snow-covered street extends forward, where a white minivan and a gold SUV are positioned directly in front of the viewer, with a partial view of another white SUV on the far right, all appearing to move away from the viewer towards distant buildings and pedestrians.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, snow continues to fall consistently across the entire scene. The white minivan and the gold SUV on the street slowly progress forward and further away from the viewer, with their brake lights illuminating red at various intervals. Concurrently, the white SUV on the far right also moves forward, and pedestrians continue walking on the opposite sidewalk relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame shows a snowy city street scene from a sidewalk perspective. To the viewer's immediate left, a modern building's glass and stone facade rises, extending an architectural overhang into the midground. In the immediate right foreground, a bare tree with snow-dusted branches partially obscures the street. The midground features a wet, snow-dusted street with a white minivan stationary in the center, a beige SUV slightly behind it to its left, and a white SUV on the far right moving away from the viewer. Further down the street to the left, a few pedestrians walk, while across the street, various commercial buildings with signs, including a visible Starbucks, line the block. In the background, tall city buildings blend into the cloudy, snowy sky, with snow visibly falling across the entire frame.
end of description
As the frames progress, the white minivan and the beige SUV in the midground begin to move forward and turn left, driving away from the viewer down the street. Concurrently, the white SUV on the far right moves forward and slightly left, revealing more of its side and front as it continues away from the viewer. Pedestrians on the left sidewalk maintain their movement, walking further down the street. Traffic lights visible across the street undergo changes, and the continuous snowfall remains a persistent element throughout the scene.

The first frame depicts a snowy city street from a sidewalk perspective, with a building and pedestrians on the left, a wet street with a white SUV at an intersection, and tall buildings under a hazy sky in the background, all beneath falling snow.
end of description
Subsequently, a white SUV initially positioned mid-right in the street begins moving forward, away from the viewer. A dark gray SUV then emerges from the right foreground, entering the nearest lane and progressing forward, away from the viewer. Towards the end, another white vehicle enters from the far right edge, joining the traffic moving away down the street.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame presents a snowy city street from a low sidewalk viewpoint, looking towards an intersection with tall buildings in the background. On the left, pedestrians walk past a store window and building facade with an overhead awning. In the midground, a dark gray SUV is poised at the intersection to turn right, while a white SUV is visible in the foreground on the rightmost lane, moving towards the viewer.
end of description
As frames progress, the dark gray SUV in the midground completes its right turn, moving further down the street away from the viewer. Simultaneously, the white SUV in the foreground continues to advance towards the viewer and moves slightly left across the intersection. Finally, an orange SUV emerges from the bottom right, moving across the foreground towards the left, eventually passing in front of and partially obscuring the white SUV.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a snowy urban street scene. In the immediate foreground, the rear of an orange SUV occupies the lower right, partially obscuring the wet road ahead. In the midground, a white SUV and a darker SUV are visible on the street, moving away from the viewer, with a tall lamppost and bare, snow-dusted trees to their left. The left side features a sidewalk with several pedestrians walking away from the viewer, alongside a modern building with a glass and metal facade. The background is filled with various tall buildings under a light grey sky, indicating ongoing snowfall.
end of description
The orange SUV in the foreground progresses forward and slightly left, revealing more of the street behind its initial position. A dark blue SUV then enters the frame from the right, moving leftward into the space previously occupied by the orange SUV, while the white and darker SUVs ahead continue their forward movement. Pedestrians on the left sidewalk also continue moving away from the viewer.
