In the first frame, a diverse group of people occupies a wet, gravelly outdoor area on a rainy day. To the far left, foreground, a wooden building stands, against which several individuals are gathered, including a man in dark clothing and women in a hat, a white top, and a brown hijab. In the midground, two individuals in purple rain ponchos walk towards the right, away from the viewer, while slightly to their right, a man in a dark jacket and jeans stands, holding a phone to capture an image. Further right in the midground and background, numerous other people are scattered, many holding open umbrellas of various colors (white, blue, green-patterned, black, and pink-patterned), some pushing strollers. The background features lush green trees and foliage, with a light-colored, rocky mountain face visible further behind.

Subsequently, the man in the dark jacket in the midground center-right lowers his phone slightly before raising it again to continue taking pictures. The two individuals in purple ponchos in the midground continue walking slowly to the right, gradually moving further across the frame away from the first-frame viewpoint. Subtle shifts in posture and position are observed among other people in the midground and background, particularly those holding umbrellas to the right. The group gathered by the wooden building on the far left remains largely stationary throughout the sequence.
