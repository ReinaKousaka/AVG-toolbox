The first frame displays a street scene on a rainy day, with a black metal fence running parallel to the viewer on the left, separating a wet road (where distant cars with red lights are visible) from a wet paved sidewalk. To the right of the fence, several thin trees in small grassy beds line the sidewalk, which extends into the distance where a person with an umbrella walks away from the viewer. On the far right, modern buildings with large glass storefronts, steps, and green shrubbery flank the sidewalk, all under a cloudy sky.
end of description
Throughout the following frames, the person with the umbrella continues walking further into the distance along the wet sidewalk. Rain visibly falls, creating splashes on the ground, particularly near the fence and trees. Additionally, various fragments of a watermark, such as "Rain," "Every," "day," or a logo, periodically appear and fade away in the bottom-left corner of the frame.

A wet urban street scene shows a paved sidewalk on the right with steps in the foreground, leading to a person walking away under an umbrella, flanked by trees and green bushes. A black railing separates this from a reflective, wet road on the left, where distant buildings and vehicles are barely visible under an overcast sky.

Throughout the following frames, the person with the umbrella continues walking further away along the right sidewalk. A car drives along the wet road on the far left, also receding into the distance. The viewpoint subtly moves forward, causing the foreground steps to gradually exit the frame by the third image.

The first frame depicts a wet city street on the left, separated by a black fence from a paved sidewalk on the right, where a person walks away from the viewer under a black umbrella. Small trees line the fence, and a modern building with large windows runs along the right, while a large black pole stands very close to the viewer on the far left. end of description. The individual with the umbrella continues to walk further away from the viewer along the wet sidewalk. Later, a dark car speeds past from left to right on the street, leaving a spray of water, its rear lights briefly visible as the rain persists.
