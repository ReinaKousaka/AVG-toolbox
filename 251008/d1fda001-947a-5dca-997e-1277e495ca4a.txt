The first frame captures a narrow, wet alleyway at dusk, bordered on the left by a white wall with some foliage and a short brick wall, and on the right by a red brick building featuring a gridded window. Ahead, a street lamp illuminates a utility pole, with more buildings and a distant cityscape visible under a dark blue sky, all reflected on the damp ground leading into the distance.

As the viewpoint advances forward, the alleyway extends further into view. The utility pole and street lamp gradually shift closer and slightly to the right, revealing a blue circular ground marker and a small white outdoor unit on the right brick wall, both further down the path from the initial vantage point.

In the first frame, the viewer looks down a wet, narrow alleyway at night. To the immediate left is a white wall, followed by a red brick wall with steps leading up, and green foliage visible above it. Further down on the left, traditional Korean-style buildings with dark roofs are seen. To the right, a red brick building with a white-grille window and an air conditioning unit is in the foreground, with a dark door below. A utility pole stands slightly right of the center, extending upwards with numerous wires, topped by a bright streetlamp that illuminates the wet street and the dark sky above. In the distance, more buildings are faintly visible under the dark sky.

The camera slowly advances forward down the alley and subtly pans to the right. The white wall on the far left gradually moves out of the frame, revealing more of the red brick wall and steps initially behind it. A pink barrier or gate, previously obscured, becomes increasingly visible to the left as the camera moves forward. The utility pole and the building on the right also recede slightly, and the streetlamp appears higher in the frame relative to the ground. The wet street, reflecting the light, expands to fill more of the lower frame as the viewpoint progresses deeper into the alley.

The first frame depicts a wet, narrow alleyway extending into the distance under a dim, twilight sky. To the viewer's immediate left, a brick wall with a small plant on top and a white electrical box recedes, topped by a traditional dark-tiled roof structure further back. On the right, a traditional Korean-style building with white patterned screens and a dark roof line parallels the path, featuring an address sign and a black utility pole in the extreme foreground. Utility lines crisscross the background sky above distant buildings and a street light at the end of the alley.
end of description
The camera slowly moves forward into the alleyway from the initial viewpoint. As a result, the brick wall on the left and the traditional building on the right progressively appear wider in the frame, drawing the viewer deeper into the scene. The utility pole on the far right gradually moves further out of view towards the right edge of the frame.
