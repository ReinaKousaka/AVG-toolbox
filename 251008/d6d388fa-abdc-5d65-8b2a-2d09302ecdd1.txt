The first frame displays a road leading into the distance under a cloudy sky, with dark, forested mountains prominent in the background. To the left, a red-roofed house is partially visible behind a green hedge running parallel to the road, while to the right, a stone wall supports houses situated on a rising bank, with a streetlight pole positioned further ahead.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road; the initial hedge and house on the left recede and are replaced by a longer, denser green hedge and another red-roofed house coming into view further back on the left. Concurrently, the stone wall and houses on the right move past, revealing more of the road ahead, and the on-screen distance updates from 4.8 KM to 4.9 KM.

The first frame shows an asphalt road curving slightly left, with vibrant red/orange and green bushes immediately to the viewer's left, and two houses with red roofs behind them. To the right, a stone wall borders the road, supporting a slope with more houses and autumn-colored bushes, all beneath a cloudy sky and a distant mountain range. A data overlay is visible in the top right. end of description. As the viewer progresses along the road, the red and green bushes previously in the immediate foreground on the left pass to the viewer's side and eventually behind. Simultaneously, more of the extensive red/orange bush line on the left, and a bare tree further down the road, move closer to the viewer. The houses on both sides and the stone wall on the right also approach and then recede behind the viewer, while the distant mountain range remains ahead in the background.

The first frame shows a paved road curving slightly to the left, flanked by a dense hedge with reddish-orange leaves immediately on the left and a lower hedge behind a stone wall on the right. Above the left hedge, a bare-branched tree with some yellow leaves is visible, while houses are situated on the hillside to the right of the road. In the far background, a dark mountain range looms under an overcast sky, with a digital overlay displaying navigation data in the top right corner.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses along the road, the hedge and bare-branched tree on the immediate left move out of frame towards the upper left. A white house with a red roof gradually comes into full view on the far left, beyond the initial position of the dense hedge. Meanwhile, the houses on the right and the distant mountain remain visible but recede further into the background relative to the advancing viewpoint.
