The first frame presents a gravel path receding to the left, bordered by a large, leafy green tree and a lamppost in the immediate foreground, with a wooden bench visible further down the path. To the right, a multi-story house with a white lower facade, wooden upper sections, a gabled roof, and a wooden balcony stands in the midground, fronted by green bushes in planters. A low metal fence separates the path from a lush garden and additional structures in the background, all under a cloudy sky.
