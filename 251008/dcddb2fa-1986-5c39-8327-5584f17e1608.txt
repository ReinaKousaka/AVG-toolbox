The first frame displays a rainy city street scene from a slightly elevated, eye-level viewpoint. In the foreground, the wet pavement of a street and an adjacent sidewalk are visible, with part of a black and green scooter's seat and handlebars in the bottom right corner. Along the left sidewalk, a row of trees with green foliage stands, extending into the midground where more trees line both sides of the wet road. A delivery scooter with a rider, and a white car, are seen moving away from the viewer in the midground lanes of the street. In the background, numerous city buildings with illuminated signs and other vehicles are visible, obscured by the rain.

The white car and delivery scooter move further away from the viewer in the subsequent frames, with the scooter eventually exiting the frame to the far right. A person holding an umbrella appears on the mid-left sidewalk, initially to the left of the viewer, and walks progressively further away down the street. This person continues their movement away, passing the initial position of the white car and approaching the distant intersection. The white car also continues to recede into the distance, gradually disappearing from view by the final frames.

In the first frame, a wet asphalt street with yellow and white markings dominates the foreground and extends into the midground. To the far left, a sidewalk with several trees lines the street, mirroring more trees and a building on the right. In the midground, a pedestrian holding an umbrella is crossing the street from left to right, while several cars are parked on the right side and others are visible further down the road with headlights on. In the background, multi-story buildings with various signs are visible under an overcast sky, indicating an urban setting where it is raining.

The pedestrian with the umbrella continues walking from the left to the right side of the street within the initial viewpoint, gradually moving past the center of the frame. Vehicles further down the road in the background also show subtle movement, with their headlights remaining visible. Throughout the frames, rain persistently falls, causing ripples and splashes on the wet road surface.

In the first frame, a wet, rain-soaked city street extends into the distance, bordered by sidewalks on the left and right. On the left sidewalk, trees and a light blue pole are visible, while on the right, red plastic chairs and tables stand under a tree beside a dark building. A person holding an umbrella is crossing the street from right to left on a white crosswalk, with a white car approaching from the far left, its headlights illuminated. Several other vehicles are further down the street, and multi-story buildings with various commercial signs form the background.
end of description
The person with the umbrella continues walking across the crosswalk from the right side towards the left, eventually moving beyond it towards the left foreground. Simultaneously, the white car with its headlights on steadily approaches the viewer from the far left, traveling down the left side of the wet road. Rain continues to fall throughout, creating visible ripples on the road's surface as the car moves past the crosswalk area, drawing closer to the first-frame viewpoint.
