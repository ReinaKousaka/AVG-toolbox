A grey asphalt road stretches from the bottom center, ascending slightly and curving right into the distance, bordered on the right by a grassy verge and a curb. On the far right, a white circular sign and a white rectangular sign on a pole are partially visible amongst tall grass and dark green coniferous trees, with a glimpse of a white house behind them. On the left, a small grey stone structure sits near the road, followed by more trees and several brown houses further uphill, all set against distant light brown mountains under a blue sky with scattered white clouds.

The viewpoint progresses forward along the road. The white sign and the partially visible white house on the right move out of frame to the right, gradually revealing a yellow house with white balconies and trim that was initially behind the first-frame's right-side objects. Trees and other houses along the road on both sides become more prominent and detailed as the camera advances through the landscape.

The first frame displays a paved road stretching into the distance, bordered on the right by a grassy bank with rocks, and on the left by a narrower grassy verge. Tall evergreen trees line the far right, partially obscuring a light-colored building, while the left features deciduous and evergreen trees alongside a fence, with a multi-story brown building visible further down the road. Distant tan mountains rise under a blue sky dotted with white clouds.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the road, the grassy banks and trees on both sides recede and move out of view. The initial light-colored building on the far right also moves out of sight, while the brown building on the left approaches and becomes more prominent relative to its first-frame position.

A paved road leads into the distance under a blue sky with distant mountains, flanked by evergreen trees and a partially obscured multi-story dark building on the left, and a grassy slope with dense evergreens on the right. A fence and a glimpse of a lighter-colored building are also visible closer on the left, while a white structure is barely visible far right behind trees.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the dark building on the left becomes fully visible before passing to the viewer's left, revealing a new, lighter-colored building closer on the left that also passes by. Concurrently, the dense evergreens and grassy slope on the right continuously pass to the viewer's right, with the distant mountains and sky remaining ahead in the far background.
