The first frame displays an aerial perspective of a deeply eroded, snow-covered landscape dominated by numerous vertical ridges and grooves. These tan and brown geological formations are extensively blanketed in white snow, with scattered dark green coniferous trees dotting the slopes, all positioned directly in front of the viewer, receding into the distance from the bottom to the top of the frame.
end of description
The viewpoint gradually pulls back and simultaneously pans slightly upwards and to the right, revealing more of the vast snow-dusted badlands. This movement exposes additional eroded terrain and distant snow-covered peaks that extend further into the background, above and to the right of the initial scene, continuously remaining in front of the original viewing position. The individual geological features diminish in apparent size as the wider landscape comes into view.
