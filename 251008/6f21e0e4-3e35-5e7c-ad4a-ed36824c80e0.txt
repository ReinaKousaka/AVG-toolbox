The first frame shows a rainy urban street scene. In the foreground to the left stands a grey utility pole with a black metal railing attached to its right, against which a purple electric scooter is parked. To the left of the pole, a wet road stretches into the midground, with a white car driving away from the viewer and red buses and city buildings visible further in the distance. To the right of the railing, a wet sidewalk runs parallel to the road, bordered by an embankment covered in neatly trimmed green bushes and trees, showing visible water runoff. A green overhead road sign is present above the road in the background.
end of description
The white car continues driving away from the viewer on the road to the left. Soon after, a second, darker car emerges behind it, also moving away on the road. The heavy rain persists, causing more significant water pooling on the sidewalk and embankment to the right. A red and white traffic cone then appears near the base of the foreground tree on the sidewalk. Finally, blue bags become visible near the next tree as the purple scooter in the foreground gradually disappears from view.
