The first frame displays a wet, tree-lined street under an overcast sky. On the left, a patterned sidewalk runs alongside several trees, the closest of which has a red banner wrapped around its trunk. To the right of the sidewalk is a two-lane asphalt road, marked with a yellow curb line and white lane dividers, extending into the distance where a faint white vehicle is visible. Further to the right, two large trucks are parked, and beyond them, a green, treelined area lines the roadside.

The red banner on the closest tree to the viewer on the left progressively unfurls, revealing Korean text. Concurrently, the distant white vehicle on the road moves steadily closer to the viewer.

The first frame shows a wet asphalt road extending from the foreground towards the distant horizon, indicating heavy rain. To the viewer's left, a paved sidewalk runs parallel to the road, lined by a row of trees and a low fence further back. On the road, a white van approaches the viewer in the left lane, while a large white dump truck with a dark brown bed is positioned to the right of the viewer, seemingly parked or moving slowly away. Beyond the road on the right, another row of green trees forms a dense line.

The approaching white van continues to move closer to the viewer in the left lane, spraying water from its tires. It then quickly passes to the viewer's left and continues further away down the road. The dump truck on the right remains relatively stationary, slightly shifting away from the viewer, while distant headlights become more distinct further down the road.

The first frame captures a rainy day on a multi-lane road. To the viewer's immediate left, a paved sidewalk runs alongside several tree trunks. Adjacent to the sidewalk, a wet asphalt road stretches into the distance, marked by solid yellow double lines and dashed white lines. In the left lane, two cars approach the viewer, the front one dark with illuminated headlights, followed by a lighter-colored vehicle. On the far right lane, a white tanker truck is visible, moving away from the viewer. The background features a grassy embankment with numerous green trees and an overcast sky.
end of description
The dark car in the left lane rapidly approaches the viewer, its headlights prominent, and then exits the frame to the viewer's immediate right. Subsequently, the lighter-colored vehicle, revealed as a silver sedan, continues to advance towards the viewer in the same lane, passing by on the right. Throughout these movements, the white tanker truck on the far right side of the road slowly progresses forward.
