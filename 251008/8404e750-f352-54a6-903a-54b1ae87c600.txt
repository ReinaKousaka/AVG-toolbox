The first frame presents a rainy night cityscape with a wet street reflecting lights. To the left, a dark tree and bushes foreground a street with a stationary white car at red traffic lights and tall buildings.

A red car emerges from the left in frame 4, moving past the white car and disappearing right by frame 8. Concurrently, a truck appears further down the street on the left, moving right, and by frame 9, a white SUV has moved into position behind the initial white car from the left.

The first frame depicts a rainy city street at night, with wet, reflective asphalt dominating the foreground. To the left, a white SUV is stopped at a red traffic light, partially obscured by a dark pole and a large bare tree trunk that dominates the center. On the right, a sidewalk features parked bicycles, a small kiosk, and several white tents, while illuminated buildings rise in the background. A green truck is visible further down the street behind the central tree, and reflections from streetlights and building lights shimmer across the scene.

Subsequently, a white bus travels from left to right, passing behind the central tree. As the bus moves, a large white banner becomes fully visible on the sidewalk behind the second tree, to the right of the initial viewpoint. Later, a pedestrian appears from the far right side of the frame, near the tents, and walks left past the parked bicycles.
