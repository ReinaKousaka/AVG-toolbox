The first frame captures a rainy city street from a sidewalk perspective, revealing a large white and green bus stopped on the wet road to the left, and numerous pedestrians, many holding dark umbrellas, on the sidewalk to the right and center foreground. Tall buildings with illuminated windows line both sides of the street, and reflections shimmer on the wet surfaces.

A dark SUV and other vehicles on the wet road to the left move further into the distance relative to the first-frame viewpoint, passing the stationary bus. Concurrently, several pedestrians on the sidewalk, including a man in a blue jacket and a woman in a dark coat, steadily approach the viewer from the mid-ground. The group of people positioned on the right side of the sidewalk also exhibits subtle shifts in their stance and position relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
