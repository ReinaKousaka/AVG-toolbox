In the first frame, the viewer looks down a two-lane road with visible white and yellow lane markings. To the left, a white car is partially visible near the curb, followed by a grey industrial fence and a large, multi-story white building with numerous dark windows in the mid-ground. Ahead in the center lane is a dark-colored sedan. On the right, a sidewalk features a green bench, a trash can, a bus stop sign, and several leafy trees, with a light-colored building having a grey base further right. Utility poles with power lines line both sides of the road, extending into the distant, hazy horizon beneath a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the white car on the left moves out of frame while the dark sedan ahead recedes into the distance. The bus stop, green bench, and trash can on the right move further to the right and eventually out of view, revealing more of the sidewalk and a speed limit sign (35 mph) further along. The multi-story building and grey fence on the left also reveal more of their length, and additional utility poles and trees emerge from the sides of the frame and pass by the viewer's position.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a straight, multi-lane asphalt road extending into the distance under a clear blue sky. To the viewer's left, a large, multi-story industrial building with numerous windows, some boarded up, stands behind a black fence, with a small green tree near its base. Further down the road on the left, a dark car is visible on the inner lane. To the viewer's right, a sidewalk features a utility pole, a small green tree, a 'Speed Limit 35' sign, and a light-colored rectangular box. Overhead, numerous utility wires stretch across the frame, connecting a series of poles extending down the road into the background.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the road ahead remains visible, and the initial dark car on the road continues further into the distance. The large industrial building on the left reveals an external fire escape as it approaches the viewer. On the right side of the road, the initial tree and speed limit sign pass out of view, and a new utility pole alongside a light-colored box becomes more prominent from the right mid-ground. A black "PUBLIC PARKING $5" sign emerges from the right mid-ground and moves closer to the viewer. Finally, a black car enters the lower-left foreground, moving in the same direction as the viewer.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a sunny street scene from a forward-looking perspective. To the immediate left, a partial dark grey car is visible alongside a tall, light-colored multi-story building featuring fire escapes. On the right, a metal fence lines the street, behind which are a 'PUBLIC PARKING $5' sign and a yellow 'P' sign with an arrow, while utility poles and overhead wires extend into the distance along both sides of the road.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward along the street, the dark grey car on the left moves ahead, and the large building on the left gradually exits the frame. Concurrently, the 'PUBLIC PARKING $5' sign on the right passes out of view as a new white "PLUG BRERA" sign appears further down the street on the right, all objects along the sides passing by the viewer's continuous forward movement.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a road extending forward with a dark gray car in the lane ahead. A tall, light-colored building and utility poles line the left, while a prominent wooden pole, a chain-link fence, and a distant billboard for 'BRERA' are visible on the right, all under a clear sky.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the dark gray car recedes further down the road. Objects on both sides, including buildings, fences, and utility poles, appear to move backward relative to the viewer, revealing yellow scooters on the right sidewalk and a clearer view of the 'BRERA' billboard, now showing 'FUORI' and 'RISTORANTE' and a street sign on the right.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a road receding into the distance under a clear blue sky, with two cars ahead; to the left, several white semi-trucks are parked next to a long white industrial building, while on the right, a sidewalk features lime and yellow scooters, a utility pole with a 'Mill Ave' sign, and a gabled brick building mostly obscured by trees and a fence.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the billboard and 'Mill Ave' sign, initially far right, exit the frame behind the viewer. The brick building to the right of the initial viewpoint continuously reveals more of its facade, including new windows and an address ("1331, 1333, 1335 E. 6th") that were previously further ahead on the right. Simultaneously, bike racks appear on the sidewalk to the right, positioned ahead of where the scooters were in the first frame, while the parked trucks and the long white building on the left recede into the distance.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, the viewer is positioned on an asphalt road with a double yellow line separating the immediate lane from oncoming traffic, and a solid white line defining a shoulder on the right. To the right, a multi-sectioned brick building with large windows and gabled roofs extends into the distance, with utility poles and wires running parallel; the nearest pole displays "no parking" and bicycle signs, while the building itself shows "13 1, 1333, 1335" near its top. To the left, a long, light-colored warehouse runs parallel to the road, with several white semi-trucks and trailers parked alongside it, facing generally towards the viewer. Cars are visible on the road ahead, receding into the distance, all under a clear blue sky.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the road. The initial utility pole on the right passes the viewer, revealing more of the brick building's facade and a "No Parking" sign further down on a new pole. Concurrently, the parked semi-trucks on the left approach and then recede towards the left as the viewer drives past them. The warehouse on the left and the brick building on the right progressively reveal more of their structures as the scene unfolds, indicating continuous forward motion.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows a paved road extending into the distance under a clear blue sky, flanked by industrial buildings and utility poles. To the left, a long white warehouse with parked semi-trailer trucks is visible, while to the right, a red brick building with large windows lines the street, with several cars driving ahead on the road.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective moves forward along the road. The street markings, utility poles, and roadside buildings on both the left (white warehouse, 'SWIFT' truck) and right (red brick building, "NO PARKING" sign) appear to shift towards and beyond the bottom edges of the frame, indicating the viewer is passing them. The cars previously seen ahead on the road move further into the distance, maintaining their relative positions.
