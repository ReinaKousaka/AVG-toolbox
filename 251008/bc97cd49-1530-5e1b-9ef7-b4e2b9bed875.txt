The first frame shows a metal-patterned ramp extending forward, flanked by a black handrail and wooden planter boxes on the left, and a silver mesh construction fence enclosing a dirt area with a wooden structure on the right, with a large building and bare tree visible further left.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward along the ramp, the planter boxes on the left and the initial section of the construction fence on the right exit the frame. A blue sign becomes visible further along the right fence, and the wooden structure behind it becomes clearer before moving past the viewpoint. The distant path and surrounding objects in the mid-ground approach the viewer.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame displays a metal pedestrian bridge extending into the midground. To the viewer's left, a light-colored building stands behind a wooden fence, while to the right, a construction site with a mesh fence and wooden planks is visible. Further ahead, bare trees line a street where a red circular sign is present.
end of description
As the camera moves forward along the bridge, the surrounding objects including the building, fences, and construction site appear closer. A person emerges from behind the right construction fence and walks leftwards across the path ahead, and a blue sign also becomes clearly visible on the right fence.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a pedestrian ramp leading forward, bordered on the left by a light-colored building and bamboo fence, and on the right by metal construction fences beside an open park area. Ahead, a tree-lined street with distant buildings is visible under a clear sky.
end of description
A person wearing a denim jacket and black backpack enters from the bottom-left of the frame, walking forward and to the right across the ramp, gradually moving past the viewer's original left-front position.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A person wearing a denim jacket and a black drawstring backpack walks away from the viewer on a concrete path, with a large light-colored building to the left and a street with parked cars and bare trees to the right. A metal railing and a white banner are visible on the immediate right.
end of description
As the frames progress, the person in the foreground continues walking forward, moving further away from the viewer along the path. Simultaneously, a new person dressed in blue becomes visible in the distance on the left side of the street, walking further to the left relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame depicts a person in a light blue jacket and black backpack walking away from the viewer on a paved sidewalk, positioned slightly right of the center. To the viewer's immediate right is a metal railing curving towards stairs, while to the left, a large tree trunk stands near the foreground and a light-colored building lines the street. In the midground, a street runs between the sidewalk and a treed area with parked cars to the right, and another person in blue is visible walking down the far left sidewalk.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the main person continues walking further into the distance and slightly right from the viewer's advancing perspective. The person on the far left also proceeds forward on the sidewalk, as the view progresses to reveal more of the street and the park beyond the railing to the right.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a person walks away from the viewer on a paved sidewalk, positioned in the right-center foreground, past a concrete barrier and a handrail on the immediate right. To the left of the sidewalk, a street runs parallel, featuring a large, bare-branched tree in the midground and two bicycles parked beneath it. Further down the street on the left, a large white building extends along the road, and another person in blue walks on the distant sidewalk. The background reveals more trees, parked cars, and buildings under a clear sky.
end of description
In the following frames, the person in the foreground continues walking away and to the right, gradually moving out of the frame entirely from the first-frame viewpoint. Concurrently, the person on the distant left sidewalk also walks further down the street, receding from view. No new objects or scenes are revealed; the primary dynamic change is the continued movement of these two individuals.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, the viewer faces an urban street scene. To the immediate right, a concrete barrier with graffiti extends into the distance, with a blue container partially visible beyond its far end. A paved sidewalk runs alongside the barrier to the left, where a large tree with bare branches stands on a small grassy median, bearing a 'no parking' sign, with two bicycles parked near its base. To the left of the tree, an asphalt road curves away, flanked by a long, light-colored building to the far left. A person in a blue jacket walks away from the viewer further down this road. In the midground, multiple cars are parked on the right side of the street, partially obscured by trees with bare branches which also extend into the background, where more buildings and a clear sky are visible.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the main dynamic change involves the person walking away from the viewer along the road on the left. This individual progressively recedes further into the distance, moving towards the distant buildings on the left side of the frame, becoming smaller and less distinct over time. No new objects or scenes are revealed; all other visible elements within the environment remain static relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
