The first frame depicts a city street scene from a moving vehicle's perspective. Directly in front, a dark SUV leads a white van, while a silver bus is positioned to the right of the van, next to several orange traffic cones. Further to the right, a white compact car and a brown SUV are visible. Tall, multi-story buildings flank both sides of the street, and an elevated pedestrian walkway spans above the road on the right. A streetlight structure hangs overhead on the left, and pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk to the left.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily advances through the frames, causing the foreground vehicles to move further ahead and the overhead structure on the right to gradually exit the top of the frame. As the viewer progresses, the street pole on the left side also moves out of frame, revealing more of the buildings and street ahead from the original viewpoint.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a multi-lane urban road extending away from the viewer under an overcast sky, flanked by tall grey buildings with numerous windows on both the left and right. In the immediate foreground, the grey asphalt road features white markings, with orange traffic bollards delineating the rightmost lane. Directly in front of the viewer, a dark SUV is followed by a white van, with more vehicles visible further down the road. On the left, a sidewalk runs alongside the road, where several pedestrians are walking away from the viewer, next to a pole and the reflective facade of the building.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the dark SUV and the white van directly in front of the viewer slowly move forward. Concurrently, pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue walking away from the viewer. Additionally, vehicles in the rightmost lane, including a white SUV and a dark van, also advance slowly forward relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame displays a city street scene from a vehicle's perspective, with a dark, multi-story building occupying the left foreground and a similar tall building in the right mid-ground. The road ahead is filled with various vehicles, most prominently a white van, while numerous pedestrians populate the sidewalks on both sides, and distant city structures appear beyond an overpass.

end of description

Over subsequent frames, the viewer's perspective advances along the road, causing the buildings and sidewalks on both sides to recede further back relative to the initial viewpoint. Pedestrians on the left sidewalk move forward and backward, with new figures appearing from behind the initial foreground building. The vehicles ahead, including the white van, generally maintain their position relative to the viewer as the urban landscape scrolls by.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a city street viewed from a moving vehicle, with a large building and pedestrians on the left sidewalk and another tall building on the right. In the center, a road with multiple cars, notably a white van and dark SUV ahead, leads towards an elevated bridge in the distance, while overhead traffic signs are visible. end of description. Subsequently, the scene advances as the viewer's perspective moves forward, making all visible elements like buildings, sidewalks, and overhead signs appear closer. Vehicles on the road also proceed, continually revealing more of the street, its features, and distant buildings relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a city street extends forward from the viewer, flanked by multi-story buildings. On the left, a building with storefronts, including what appears to be a 7-Eleven, is visible with a pedestrian walking on the sidewalk. A lamppost with two circular "no entry" or "no stopping" signs hangs above the center of the road, and further ahead, an overpass spans horizontally, with a tunnel entrance visible beneath it. On the right lane, a white van is followed by a darker car, while a red car leads in the left lane towards the tunnel, all positioned ahead of the viewer.

end of description

As the viewer moves forward, the lamppost with the 'no entry/parking' signs rises and moves out of view to the upper left, while a "fire hydrant" sign becomes fully visible on the left side of the road, also moving upwards. A white bicycle appears on the left sidewalk behind the initial pedestrian, who continues walking further away. Concurrently, a white SUV on the far right passes the white van ahead, and another dark SUV emerges on the right and advances forward, with the tunnel entrance becoming noticeably larger and more prominent ahead of the viewer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a city street leading to a dark tunnel entrance under an overpass, with a white van in the right lane directly ahead of the viewer and a crosswalk in the immediate foreground. To the viewer's left, a multi-story building with a display board and a pedestrian are visible on the sidewalk.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the white van in the right lane moves forward towards the tunnel, and the pedestrian on the left sidewalk walks forward and then crosses the road from left to right across the crosswalk. Simultaneously, cars inside the tunnel advance, and the viewer's perspective gradually moves closer to the tunnel entrance.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The viewer is positioned at an intersection, facing a large concrete underpass leading into a dark tunnel, with a crosswalk directly in front. A white van and a red car are stopped just inside the tunnel entrance to the right, facing forward. Above the tunnel, a railway overpass with overhead lines spans across, while a concrete pillar to the left of the tunnel entrance displays various signs, including a green pedestrian signal and a green vehicle traffic light suspended slightly to its right.

end of description
As the viewer moves forward into the tunnel, the white van and red car ahead also progress deeper inside. The concrete pillar on the left reveals more graffiti as the viewpoint advances. Concurrently, the pedestrian signal on the left changes from a green 'walk' symbol to an orange/red 'don't walk' symbol. A 'no parking' sign becomes clearly visible on the right wall further inside the tunnel.
