In the first frame, a person holding a white umbrella is seen from behind in the foreground, slightly right of center, on a wet city sidewalk at night. To the viewer's left stands a modern building with a brightly lit glass entrance and a black and yellow striped barrier. Further to the right, along a tree-lined street, other pedestrians with umbrellas walk away from the viewer, with distant city lights and a Korean flag visible in the background.

Subsequently, the foreground person with the white umbrella remains largely in place. A new individual, wearing a dark jacket and holding a bag, appears from the mid-right, walking towards the viewer on the sidewalk, eventually passing into the left foreground.

The first frame depicts a rainy city street at night, with a blurry person foreground left and another under a white umbrella foreground right. A modern building with a glass entrance is visible on the left, while a wet sidewalk extends into the distance, populated by a tree and multiple umbrella-carrying pedestrians walking away, under distant city lights.
end of description
As frames progress, the blurry foreground figure quickly moves out of frame to the left. Subsequently, a woman in a beige coat and white pants, initially in the midground walking away, walks towards and then past the viewer's left, followed by another woman in a light grey coat who also approaches the viewer along the same sidewalk. Meanwhile, other pedestrians continue to recede into the distance on the sidewalk, and the person with the white umbrella on the right remains mostly stationary.

The first frame depicts a rainy city street at night with a wet sidewalk, where a partially visible person with an umbrella and a woman in a light coat walk towards the viewer on the left, adjacent to building steps. A prominent tree stands in the mid-ground right, beyond which numerous pedestrians with umbrellas traverse the sidewalk and street, and a person with a white umbrella is seen on the far right, with city buildings, parked cars, and a South Korean flag visible in the background.
end of description
In subsequent frames, the people on the left continue moving towards the viewer and then out of frame to the left, revealing more of the building entrance and a black and yellow barrier emerging from the left mid-ground. Concurrently, the person with the white umbrella on the far right moves further right, mostly exiting the frame, and a new woman with a black umbrella and blue jeans appears from the distance in the mid-ground, walking briskly towards the viewer. Throughout the sequence, the many pedestrians in the background continue their movement along the street, either approaching or receding from the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame displays a wet city sidewalk at night, bustling with numerous pedestrians carrying umbrellas of various colors, primarily black and white, walking both towards and away from the viewer. In the immediate foreground, a person in dark clothing with a black umbrella and a phone walks towards the viewer, with a yellow and black barrier visible on the far left and building steps marked "512" directly to their left. Along the midground, trees line the sidewalk, leading to a street with cars and distant illuminated buildings, and a South Korean flag can be seen hanging on the right.
end of description
As the frames advance, the foreground figures with black umbrellas move progressively closer to the viewer and pass out of view to the left, revealing more pedestrians behind them. Subsequently, a new individual holding a patterned umbrella and a cup appears in the mid-left, moving towards the viewer and then also passing by. Throughout the sequence, the many people in the mid-ground continue their steady movement along the wet sidewalk, with the distant cityscape remaining constant.

The first frame depicts a rainy city street at night, with a wet sidewalk leading into the distance, bordered by illuminated tall buildings and streetlights. Pedestrians holding umbrellas walk away from the viewer in the midground, centered around a small tree, while a partial figure is on the far left and another holding a large white umbrella is on the far right.
end of description
Over the following frames, the partial figure on the far left moves out of view, revealing steps to the left of the scene. Concurrently, a man without an umbrella emerges from the midground on the left sidewalk, walking towards the viewer. He steadily progresses into the foreground, becoming the most prominent figure on the left, as other pedestrians continue moving away in the background.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
In the first frame, a city street at night is seen, with a man in a dark suit walking towards the viewer on the left side of a wet sidewalk, past a building with large reflective windows. To the right, a tree with yellowish-green leaves stands in the midground, beyond which a crowd of people, many holding umbrellas, moves away from the viewer. In the immediate foreground on the right, the back of a person holding a large white umbrella is visible, obscuring part of the street where cars are parked or driving further down. Tall illuminated buildings line both sides of the street in the background.

end of description

The man on the left walks past the viewer and exits the frame to the left. The crowd of umbrella-holding pedestrians in the midground continues to move away from the viewer along the sidewalk. The person with the white umbrella on the right slightly shifts further right, revealing more of the street and a white car in the mid-background.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
In the first frame, a night-time city street is visible, wet from rain. In the immediate foreground, to the right, a person in a dark coat holds a large white umbrella, facing away from the viewer. To the left, a wide sidewalk leads into the midground, occupied by numerous people walking away from the viewer, many holding various colored umbrellas. A tree with prominent roots stands in the mid-right, separating the sidewalk from a narrow grassy strip. On the far left, a modern building with reflective glass windows reflects city lights, while in the mid-right background, parked cars and more pedestrians are seen on a street alongside other illuminated buildings. A tall building with a distinctive top spire is visible in the distant center background against the dark sky.
end of description
The people on the sidewalk continuously walk away from the viewer towards the background, their umbrellas creating a moving procession. New individuals consistently enter the frame from the left midground, carrying open umbrellas. Notably, a person in a beige jacket holding a closed umbrella appears from the far left and progresses towards the mid-left. The person in the immediate foreground holding a white umbrella remains mostly stationary, shifting only slightly. Vehicles in the background street largely stay in position, though subtle light changes suggest slight movement or new cars further down the street.
