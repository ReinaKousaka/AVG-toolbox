The first frame depicts a wide city street extending into the distance, with pedestrian crosswalks prominent in the foreground. Tall buildings flank the road: a brick structure with a green traffic light, pedestrians, and parked cars (including a yellow taxi) are on the left, while modern glass buildings with a red traffic light and more vehicles line the right.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the crosswalk recedes, and structures on both sides become progressively closer. The left traffic light changes to red, revealing prominent 'PIZZA' and 'McDonald's' signs, extending scaffolding, and a 'PENSKE' truck on the far left. Simultaneously, the right traffic light changes, and white flexible bollards appear along the curb, with 'LOVESAC' and 'JAMES LEWIS' storefronts becoming visible.

The first frame depicts a wide city street receding into the distance, flanked by tall buildings and skyscrapers under a bright sky. In the foreground, a white Penske truck and a yellow taxi are on the left, alongside parked cars, while on the right, a building with scaffolding and white bollards leads to a "JAMES LENS" sign. Several vehicles are visible moving away from the viewer further down the street.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the Penske truck and yellow taxi on the left progressively move out of frame to the viewer's immediate left and then behind the first-frame viewpoint. New crosswalk markings appear underfoot, and a green traffic light on the left emerges closer to the viewer's original position, while the distant city scene advances toward the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame displays a multi-lane city street extending into the distance, bordered by tall buildings and skyscrapers on both sides under a bright sky. A yellow taxi is partially visible in the bottom-left, with a line of parked cars along the left sidewalk and several vehicles moving away from the viewer in the middle lanes, while pedestrians occupy the right sidewalk.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the yellow taxi on the far left and the initial parked cars recede and eventually disappear from view. Vehicles ahead progress further into the distance, and traffic lights at the approaching intersection change from red to green, indicating forward movement. A white delivery truck appears on the left, moving alongside the viewer as the perspective shifts. The street's crosswalk markings draw closer and eventually pass beneath the viewer's position, revealing more of the building facades, including "Bloomingdale's" signage on the left.
