The first frame shows the viewer on a sidewalk under scaffolding. Immediately to the left, a person's back is partially visible, while further ahead, a man in a black jacket walks away from the viewer's gaze. The sidewalk, lined by scaffolding, leads to a street with a crosswalk and buildings featuring illuminated storefronts in the distance, where a pedestrian in a light coat walks.

The person on the far left and the man in the black jacket exit the frame to the left. Subsequently, a man in a dark trench coat and white sneakers emerges from the mid-ground, walking directly towards the viewer on the sidewalk. As he approaches the foreground, a woman in a dark coat and heels is revealed walking across the street to the right, and a person with a camera on a tripod becomes visible further back on the sidewalk.

The first frame displays a night street scene partially covered by scaffolding. To the far left, a man in a dark coat walks away from the viewer towards the left edge of the frame. To the far right, a woman in a dark coat walks towards the right, partially obscured by scaffolding. Centrally, under the scaffolding, a person sits on a stool, leaning forward, with what appears to be a camera or stick on a tripod. In the background, a city street features buildings with illuminated storefronts, including "ANCONA PHARMACY" and "First Republic," along with a crosswalk.

The man on the left and the woman on the right progressively move out of their respective sides of the frame. Subsequently, a white SUV enters the street from the left, drives towards the right in the background, and then exits the frame. As the SUV departs, a new person in light clothing emerges from the far right on the sidewalk, walking towards the left and gradually moving closer to the viewer's right. The person sitting under the scaffolding remains largely stationary throughout the sequence.
