A street extends forward from the viewer, flanked by multi-story buildings with traditional architecture on both sides; a golden street lamp and parked cars are to the left, while a construction-covered building and a red traffic light are to the right, partially hidden by trees. Distant snow-capped mountains rise under a blue, cloudy sky in the background.
end of description
In the subsequent frames, the traffic light ahead, previously red, changes to green. Simultaneously, a black car initially positioned in the mid-ground on the left side of the road begins to move forward, driving away from the viewer further into the distance along the street.

In the first frame, a wide street stretches from the foreground into the distance, flanked by buildings with traditional architecture under a clear blue sky dotted with white clouds. To the left, a two-story building, a golden streetlamp, a dark SUV, and a row of green trees are visible, with snow-capped mountains in the far background. To the right, a taller multi-story building with scaffolding on its lower section, more golden streetlamps, and flower planters line the street, while traffic lights with green signals and a '40' speed limit sign hang above the road in the mid-ground.
end of description
The viewpoint steadily moves forward along the road. The black SUV on the left drives away and exits the frame to the left of the first-frame viewpoint. The traffic lights and speed limit sign, initially centered in the mid-ground, move closer to the viewer and pass overhead before receding behind the first-frame viewpoint. As the camera progresses, a yellow scooter appears on the road to the left, and two red and white striped cones become newly visible on the right sidewalk, closer to the viewer than the initial scene.

The first frame displays a wide road with a crosswalk in the immediate foreground, flanked by a median featuring yellow flowers and parked cars to the left, and a sidewalk with yellow scooters and red-and-white bollards to the right. Overhead, two green traffic lights and a '40' speed limit sign are visible, while green trees line both sides of the receding street, leading to snow-capped mountains under a blue sky in the distant background.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the traffic lights first go dark, then the right light turns red, eventually moving above and behind the initial viewing plane as the crosswalk and bollards pass below. Subsequently, red banners become visible on light poles lining both sides of the street, and new objects like a red vehicle appear on the right side and a golden lamppost on the left, further down the road from the original viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame presents a straight grey road stretching into the distance, bordered by black metal fencing and flower planters on the left, and a sidewalk on the right. Both sides are lined with green-leafed trees and buildings, featuring a golden street lamp with red banners prominently on the left. In the far background, snow-capped mountains are visible under a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. end of description.
As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward along the road, causing the golden street lamp on the left and the initial street lamp on the right to move out of the frame. Simultaneously, a blue road sign with Chinese text becomes visible further down the road on the right, and additional parked motorcycles and a pedestrian are revealed along the right sidewalk.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a straight road extending into the distance under a bright blue sky with white clouds, flanked by rows of green-leafed trees. To the viewer's left, a parallel road is separated by a dark fence and planters, featuring a distant pedestrian and vehicles, while to the right, a sidewalk holds parked yellow scooters and motorcycles, with storefronts behind the trees and snow-capped mountains visible far ahead centrally.
end of description
As the perspective moves forward along the street, objects initially in the mid-ground, like the decorative planters with yellow flowers on the left and the scooters on the right, progress towards and then pass the original viewpoint. A dark blue vehicle on the left and new red-fronted buildings on the right become more distinctly visible and move past, revealing previously hidden parts of the street further ahead.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a wide street extending into the distance under a bright blue sky dotted with white clouds, leading towards distant snow-capped mountains. In the immediate foreground, a black metal barrier with yellow and orange flower planters runs along the left, while a sidewalk with green-leafed trees and traditionally styled buildings with red accents lines the right, where yellow scooters are parked. On the left side of the road, a blue three-wheeled vehicle is followed by a white SUV, both moving towards the viewer.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The black metal barrier and flower planters on the left recede and exit the frame, while the blue three-wheeled vehicle and white SUV continue to approach, eventually passing and exiting the left side. On the right, the parked yellow scooters also recede from view, revealing more of the architectural details of the buildings and additional lampposts. The overall scene continuously shifts as the camera advances down the street towards the mountains.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame displays a road extending into the distance under a blue, cloudy sky towards snow-capped mountains. A white SUV is on the left road lane, alongside a fence, flower planters with yellow blooms, and green trees, while the right side features a row of green trees, buildings, a red banner, a blue directional sign, and parked vehicles.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the white SUV exits the scene to the left, and the red banner, gray pickup truck, and white parked car move off-screen to the right. The fence and flower planters on the left, along with the blue directional sign on the right, advance towards the foreground. A motorcycle is newly revealed parked on the right sidewalk, while the initial diamond road marking disappears behind the viewer, replaced by a white arrow appearing in the foreground.
