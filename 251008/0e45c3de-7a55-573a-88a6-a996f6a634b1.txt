The first frame captures a lively winter street scene featuring a large yellow building with balconies on the left, displaying a 'TISSOT' sign, and a brown hotel building further back on the right. Snow-covered ground fills the foreground and path, with people sitting on a stone bench to the left and a group walking centrally, while majestic snow-capped mountains loom in the background under a clear sky, and colorful flags fly on the right.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the group of five individuals walking along the central snow-dusted path steadily progresses forward, moving deeper into the scene towards the background buildings. Simultaneously, the two people on the far left of this main group and the person in the red jacket on the right also advance, indicating a continuous forward movement of pedestrians. The colorful flags on the right exhibit subtle waving motions.
