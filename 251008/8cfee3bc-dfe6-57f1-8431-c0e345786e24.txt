As the frames progress, several pedestrians become active in the mid-ground. A woman in a light jacket emerges from the right and walks left across the street, passing in front of the stationary police car. Simultaneously, a man in a dark shirt and a woman with light hair walk from behind the rightmost bus towards the viewer's left. Another man, wearing a white shirt, then emerges from behind the right bus and follows them across the street. The two large blue buses and the police car remain stationary throughout the sequence.

In the foreground, two pedestrians cross a city street towards the viewer: a woman on the left, partially obscured, and a man on the right, walking leftward. A white NYPD police car with flashing lights is centrally positioned in the midground, facing away, flanked by a blue hybrid bus on the left and another blue bus on the right, both also facing away. The background features a long street lined with tall buildings, including one on the far left displaying two American flags.

As the sequence progresses, the pedestrians continue crossing the street towards the viewer; the woman moves further right from her initial position, while the man shifts left, both gradually moving out of the frame as the vehicles remain stationary.

The first frame captures a city street scene with a man in a light shirt and backpack, and another person in a dark shirt, crossing in the immediate foreground. Two blue city buses flank the street, one to the left displaying "H3" and "9435" and another to the right marked "NOT IN SERVICE" and "1328," both facing the viewer, while a white NYPD police car sits directly behind the pedestrians and between the buses, facing away. Tall buildings line the street into the distant background, with American flags visible on a building to the far left.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the man and the other pedestrian continue walking from left to right, moving further away from the viewer and gradually exiting the frame on the right side. Concurrently, the police car's red and blue emergency lights, located behind the pedestrians and between the buses, flash intermittently, remaining stationary relative to the viewer.

The first frame displays a bustling city street scene with a white-and-blue NYPD police car in the immediate foreground, slightly right of center, and two blue public buses (9435 on the left, 1328 on the right) behind it, all facing away from the viewer. Tall buildings line both sides of the street, with American flags on the left building and pedestrians on the left sidewalk. In the middle distance, a queue of other vehicles extends down the street under an overcast sky. A blurry object partially obscures the lower right foreground.
end of description
The blue bus (9435) in the left lane steadily moves forward, away from the viewer, with its route number display changing from 'M5' to 'BXM3' and then 'M3'. The blurry object in the bottom right foreground shifts, slightly revealing more of the police car. Pedestrians on the left sidewalk also advance further down the street, while the NYPD police car and the bus in the right lane remain stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
