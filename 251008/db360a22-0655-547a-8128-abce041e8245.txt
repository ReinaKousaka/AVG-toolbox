The first frame depicts a paved road curving gently left, flanked by a metal guardrail and dense evergreen trees on the left, and a stone retaining wall on the right, above which a multi-story building with wooden balconies is visible. Ahead, distant mountains and a village are under a partly cloudy sky, while a smaller paved road diverges right from the main road, marked by a 'No Entry' sign on the stone wall and featuring a small, dark-roofed building.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the initial guardrail to the left and the 'No Entry' sign on the stone wall to the right progressively recede behind the camera's original viewpoint, revealing new sections of the road ahead. The small dark-roofed building, initially in the mid-ground, moves closer, revealing its red fa√ßade and windows, with a street light pole appearing to its left, which is ahead and slightly left of the first frame's central view. Further along the road, a new section of metal railing and a grey garbage bin appear to the right of where the original stone wall was positioned. The multi-story building on the far right shifts higher and further right relative to the first-frame viewpoint, while the distant mountains and village appear closer and clearer ahead of the viewer.
