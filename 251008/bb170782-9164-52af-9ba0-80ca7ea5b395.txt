The first frame presents a serene valley view with a paved path leading directly away from the viewer towards distant mountains, flanked by a stream to the left and lush greenery with a wooden signpost to the right. Two individuals are actively herding several light brown cows along the path, moving away from the viewer; a dark SUV is parked further ahead on the right side of the path, behind some of the animals. end of description. The people and cows continue moving further away from the viewer along the path. The person in the white shirt then opens a wooden gate, previously less distinct due to distance, which spans across the path in the mid-ground. After all the cows and people pass through the gate, it is closed behind them, and the entire group proceeds further into the valley, continually receding from the first-frame viewpoint.
