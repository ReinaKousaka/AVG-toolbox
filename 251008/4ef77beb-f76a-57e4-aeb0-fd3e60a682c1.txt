frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
In the first frame, the viewer is on a multi-lane highway, looking forward down the road. To the immediate left is a solid white line, and to the immediate right is a dashed white line, delineating the current lane. A concrete barrier runs along the right side of the road, extending into the distance, while a similar barrier on the left supports an elevated concrete bridge structure, partially covered by green vegetation, also receding into the background. Ahead and to the right, in the right lane, are two red and white striped traffic cones, with a white truck visible further down the left lane. Dominating the background are large, verdant mountains covered in trees, rising on both sides of the highway under a sky filled with white clouds. A navigation overlay showing a map and the timestamp "14:30:56" is in the bottom-left corner.

end of description

As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the highway. The red and white traffic cones, initially ahead and to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, progressively move closer and eventually pass to the right of the viewer's original position, appearing behind. The white truck, initially further ahead, also draws nearer to the first-frame viewpoint. The elevated concrete bridge on the left and the mountainous landscape around the road continually shift in perspective, revealing more of the immediate road ahead and the scenery beyond, reflecting the viewer's forward motion. The timestamp in the bottom-left corner updates from 14:30:56 to 14:30:59.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame depicts a multi-lane highway extending into the distance under a cloudy sky. To the left, a concrete overpass runs parallel to the road with green foliage on its upper edge, while lush green mountains rise majestically in the background. A white truck is visible in the middle lane ahead, and an orange and white traffic cone stands in the right lane closer to the viewer. A navigation overlay showing 'Leyue' and a timestamp '14:30:59' is present in the bottom left.
end of description
The viewer moves forward along the highway as the frames progress. The white truck ahead continuously recedes further into the distance within the middle lane. Concurrently, the orange and white traffic cone in the right lane approaches the viewer, passes by, and then moves away behind the viewer's initial position, eventually exiting the frame. The concrete overpass to the left and the background mountains also progressively recede as the viewpoint advances.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
In the first frame, a multi-lane highway stretches into the distance, with the viewer's vehicle positioned in the middle lane. To the immediate left, a concrete barrier with a metal railing parallels an elevated concrete overpass. Ahead in the distance, a white truck is visible in the rightmost lane, with a red and white traffic cone positioned slightly ahead and to its right on the white line. To the right, another concrete barrier separates the highway from the shoulder, and further right, another elevated road structure is visible. Dominating the background are lush green, tree-covered mountains under a partly cloudy sky, with faint wind turbines visible on the peaks. A digital overlay in the bottom-left corner shows "Leyue" and "14:31:01."
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer's perspective advances along the highway. The red and white traffic cone, initially ahead and to the right of the first-frame viewpoint, progressively moves closer and then past the viewer towards the lower right of the frame. The white truck maintains its distance further down the highway relative to the viewer. Concurrently, the digital overlay in the bottom-left corner updates, changing the road name to "Jingkun Ex" and advancing the timestamp from 14:31:01 to 14:31:03.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
A multi-lane highway stretches forward with a white box truck and a traffic cone ahead to the right of the viewer. To the left, an elevated concrete bridge parallels the road, backed by a steep, lush green mountain. To the right, beyond concrete barriers, a valley with more distant mountains is visible under a partly cloudy sky. A map overlay and timestamp are at the bottom left.
end of description
The viewer's perspective moves forward along the highway. The elevated concrete bridge structure on the left approaches, revealing more of its underside as it extends closer to the viewer. Concurrently, the red and white traffic cone, initially positioned in front and slightly to the right of the viewer, moves progressively closer, then passes to the immediate right and slightly behind the viewer. The white box truck ahead maintains its forward position relative to the moving viewpoint, while the timestamp advances.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame shows a multi-lane highway stretching into the distance from the viewer's perspective. To the viewer's left, a concrete barrier with a metal railing runs alongside the road, beyond which an elevated highway structure is visible, backed by a steep, lush green mountain. In the distance, large mountains covered in green foliage dominate the horizon under a partly cloudy blue sky. A white box truck is driving ahead in the right lane, followed by a red and white traffic cone further ahead. To the viewer's right, another concrete barrier borders the highway, and beyond it, a valley with what appears to be a river or brown water and more distant mountains is visible. Overlays in the bottom left show a map with "Leyue" and "Yang-kun-fu", and a timestamp "14:31:05" at the bottom center.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the highway. The truck and the traffic cone, initially ahead, gradually recede into the distance as the viewer catches up to and passes the cone. New sections of the left elevated highway, the right valley, and the surrounding mountains become continually revealed as the journey proceeds.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame depicts a multi-lane highway stretching forward, bordered by concrete barriers, with an elevated concrete overpass running parallel to the left. Lush green mountains rise behind the overpass and in the central midground, while a light-colored truck proceeds ahead on the highway's right lane, and a red and white traffic cone is visible on the right shoulder further forward. A partly cloudy sky is overhead.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the highway. The red and white traffic cone on the right shoulder steadily approaches the viewer, moving from the mid-right towards the lower right of the frame. The elevated concrete overpass on the left gradually extends further into the viewer's immediate left periphery, while the distant mountains maintain their general position relative to the advancing viewpoint. The timestamp updates chronologically from 14:31:07 to 14:31:09.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame shows the viewer on a multi-lane highway, with concrete barriers to the left and right. Ahead, a white box truck is positioned in the rightmost lane, with a single red and white traffic cone to its right. To the far left, an elevated concrete overpass structure runs parallel to the highway, while steep, green mountains rise across the left and center background. Distant, hazier mountains are visible to the right, beyond a river or channel, all under a blue sky with scattered clouds. A map overlay and timestamp "14:31:09" are in the bottom left corner.

end of description

As the scene progresses, the initial red and white traffic cone, first ahead of the viewer to the right of the truck, approaches and then recedes to the viewer's right. A second identical traffic cone appears further along the highway to the right, initially behind the first, also moving closer. A green highway sign displaying '2334 G5' and '498 è¥¿' emerges on the left, attached to the elevated concrete structure, moving closer and eventually passing the viewer's left. Lastly, a rectangular patched area on the road becomes visible to the right, appearing after the first cone has passed, as the white box truck in front continues to draw nearer.
