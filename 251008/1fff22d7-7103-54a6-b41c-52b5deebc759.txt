In the first frame, two elderly individuals walk away from the viewer on a brick pathway, lined with green trees and benches to their left. To the right, a dark metal railing separates the path from a wide river, beyond which a city skyline with numerous buildings, including the prominent UN headquarters, stretches under a blue sky.

As the frames progress, the two people continue walking further away, moving slightly towards the right side of the path. The viewpoint subtly advances forward and pans a little to the right, gradually revealing more of the river and the cityscape on the right side of the frame, including a taller, darker skyscraper further down the river.
