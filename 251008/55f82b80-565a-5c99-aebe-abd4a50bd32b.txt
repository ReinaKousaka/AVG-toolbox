From a slightly elevated viewpoint, a wet street covered in fallen yellow ginkgo leaves stretches from the foreground to the midground. To the immediate left, a dark car's front-left quarter is visible. A line of vehicles, led by a dark sedan with illuminated brake lights, is stalled on the wet road to the left of a prominent tree trunk in the mid-left. To the right of this tree, a row of ginkgo trees with vibrant yellow foliage lines the street, while a sidewalk adorned with more yellow leaves runs along the right. Further right, a stone sculpture of two figures on horseback stands before a building with an artistic facade. In the background, traditional-style buildings rise on the far left, and more urban structures extend into the distance under an overcast sky.

The dark car in the left foreground moves forward, revealing the white car directly behind it in the mid-left, as the entire line of cars advances slightly. The viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly to the right. A pedestrian emerges from behind the horseback sculpture on the right side of the first frame and walks towards the far right. Later, an individual becomes visible sitting at the base of the prominent tree, initially positioned just right of center in the first frame.

The first frame displays a wet autumn street scene, with yellow ginkgo leaves scattered across the pavement and sidewalks. In the foreground left, a dark car is partially visible, followed by a white sedan with its taillights illuminated, and another white car behind it. To the far left, a traditional-style building with a tiled roof stands, backed by other structures on a hillside. A tree trunk occupies the center-left foreground, part of a row of vibrant yellow-leafed trees extending down the street. On the right, a large stone statue of two figures on horseback is visible near a building with multiple signs, alongside a yellow A-frame sign. The sky is overcast.

The camera slowly pans right, revealing a bronze statue of a person sitting on a bench in the foreground, which was initially hidden behind the left-most tree trunk from the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the dark vehicle on the viewer's immediate left moves out of frame, and the white sedan further left advances. As the panning continues, the stone statue on the right moves progressively out of view to the right, showcasing more of the street and buildings further ahead in the distance.

A street scene shows a bronze statue of a seated woman in the lower-left foreground, partially obscured by a tree trunk to its immediate left. A sidewalk, abundantly covered in yellow ginkgo leaves, extends into the midground, bordered on its right by a row of ginkgo trees with vibrant yellow foliage, while a grey horse statue stands on the far right. To the left of the sidewalk, a road features white cars, with traditional Korean-style buildings visible on the hillside to the upper left.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly shifts right and slightly forward. The bronze statue of the woman moves out of the frame to the left, and the white car on the far left proceeds forward, eventually exiting the scene. Further down the street, behind the second ginkgo tree from the first-frame viewpoint, a yellow triangular road sign becomes visible.
