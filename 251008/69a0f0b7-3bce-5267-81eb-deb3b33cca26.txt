The first frame depicts a dense forest scene with the ground covered in green foliage and moss. In the foreground, several fallen tree trunks, heavily covered in moss, lie horizontally and diagonally across the lower half of the view, with one prominent log extending from the bottom-left towards the center-right. In the midground, numerous tall, slender tree trunks stand vertically, forming a thick forest, and a smaller, bushy conifer tree is visible slightly left of the center, behind the foreground logs. The background shows more dense forest receding into the distance.

The viewpoint subtly shifts to the right across the subsequent frames. This movement gradually reveals more of the dense forest floor and additional fallen logs previously obscured to the right of the initial view. A segment of a new fallen log becomes visible in the bottom-left corner of the frame, along with more undergrowth appearing towards the bottom right. The small conifer tree in the midground subtly moves to the left within the frame as the perspective pans right, maintaining the overall depth of the forest.
