The first frame depicts a dirt path stretching centrally forward, flanked on the viewer's left by bare trees and brush, and on the right by a green field with patches of snow. Ahead, several individuals are visible running along the path, receding into the mid-ground, with one runner in a dark top most prominent. In the background, a dense line of trees extends across the horizon, with a large dark building partially visible to the far right. Overlaid on the image are various telemetry data points at the left, bottom, and right edges, indicating distance, speed, time, and an elevation profile.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the path, causing the foreground path, snow patches, and adjacent vegetation to shift towards the bottom and sides of the frames. The runners previously ahead of the viewer on the path appear incrementally closer. Concurrently, the overlaid data reflects this movement, with the distance increasing from 5.6 km to 5.7 km and the elapsed time advancing. The percentage gradient also shifts from -4.8% to -2.0%, and the yellow marker on the route profile graph moves to the right, indicating progression along the depicted route.

The first frame displays a dirt path stretching forward from the viewer's perspective. To the left, a narrow strip of snow-dusted ground borders a body of water, backed by a wooded hill. To the right, a wider snowy strip transitions into a green field, with a line of bare trees further along the path; a person jogs ahead, with a group of people visible much further in the distance.
end of description
As the viewer moves forward, the jogging person and the distant group on the path gradually draw nearer. The snow patches along both sides of the path appear to recede, revealing more brown ground. Concurrently, various on-screen metrics such as pace, speed, grade, and elapsed time update, with the elevation profile's indicator steadily advancing to the right.
