On a wooden countertop against a white subway tile backsplash, a collection of liquor bottles, a cocktail shaker, a reed diffuser, and a black candle are arranged on the left. Towards the mid-right, an oval silver tray holds a glass decanter, two tumblers, and a small potted plant.
end of description
A mint green table lamp, illuminated, becomes visible to the right of the potted plant. Soon after, a reflective silver pitcher and then a clear picture frame, containing a vintage car photo, appear further to the right of the lamp. The scene then subtly pans right, framing these newly revealed objects more prominently.
