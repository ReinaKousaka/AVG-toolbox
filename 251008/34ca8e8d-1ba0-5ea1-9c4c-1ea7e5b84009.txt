In the first frame, the viewer looks down a street flanked by buildings. To the left, a cream-colored building with red trim and numerous windows has several air conditioning units and decorative panels on its lower wall, with red lanterns hanging from its upper edge. To the right, another multi-story building with similar colors features ground-level shops and a prominent red lantern, with multiple scooters parked on its sidewalk. A white sedan is centered on the street, driving away, while further in the distance, more buildings, including a tall white one and a structure with a red roof, are visible before a backdrop of lush green mountains.

The white sedan continues to move further down the street, away from the viewer. A person on a scooter emerges from behind the white sedan, moving towards the right side of the frame, eventually parking near the other scooters. A red car becomes more visible in the distance, positioned to the left of the central red-roofed building.
