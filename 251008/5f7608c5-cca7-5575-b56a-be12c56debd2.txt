The first frame showcases a modern, multi-level house on the right, featuring large glass windows set in black frames and a section of stone cladding. Directly in front of the viewer, an expansive grey terrace extends towards the left, furnished with white modular sofas and sun loungers, alongside an infinity pool and a patch of artificial green grass, all bordered by a glass railing. Beyond these elements, a vast cityscape and distant hills are visible under a clear blue sky, receding into the background to the left.

As the frames progress, the viewpoint slightly pulls back and lowers, revealing more of the terrace and the curving upper architecture of the house to the right, including a glass balcony previously out of view. The infinity pool and green turf area to the left become more completely visible. Additionally, a person emerges inside the lower level of the house, behind the glass door to the right of the outdoor sofas, standing further back from the viewer's initial position.
