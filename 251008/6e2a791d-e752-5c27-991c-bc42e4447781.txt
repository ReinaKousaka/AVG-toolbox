frame_0000000000-frame_0000000128:
The first frame shows train tracks extending directly in front of the viewer, curving slightly to the right in the distance. To the left, a body of water reflects a dark, tree-covered mountain, while a rocky cliff face with sparse vegetation rises steeply to the right. Overhead power lines are visible, supported by a utility pole on the right near the cliff, with distant, sunlit mountains under a clear sky in the background.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the train tracks. The utility poles and rocky cliff on the right side steadily advance towards and then pass the viewer's right. Concurrently, the body of water and the mountain on the left also move past, revealing more of the winding landscape ahead. A black signal light, initially distant and positioned to the left of the tracks, gradually comes into clearer view as the train approaches it.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
The first frame shows a forward view from a train on tracks, which curve slightly right into the distance, flanked by a tranquil body of water reflecting mountains on the left and a steep, rocky mountain face on the right. A black signal post with three lights stands prominently to the left of the tracks, while an overhead power line structure and a distant tunnel entrance are visible along the right side.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewer moves forward, causing the signal post to pass to the left and a power line pole on the right to also move past the viewer. The train steadily approaches the tunnel entrance, which becomes larger and more prominent directly ahead and to the right of the tracks.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame displays a train track stretching into the distance, leading to a tunnel entrance directly ahead. To the right, a steep, dark rocky cliff runs alongside the tracks, while to the left, a still body of water reflects a range of large mountains in the background. Overhead lines extend above the tracks towards the tunnel, and "Vmax: 80kmh" is displayed at the bottom left.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the tunnel entrance progressively gets closer. The rocky cliff on the immediate right and the reflective water and distant mountains on the left continuously pass by. A tall utility pole with attached overhead lines emerges from the left side of the tracks and moves past the viewer, followed by a small utility box appearing on the ground beside the tracks on the left.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a train track extending into the distance, leading to an arched tunnel entrance centered in the mid-ground, flanked by a dark, rugged rock face on the right and a calm body of water with reflections on the left. A steep mountain rises on the far left, while overhead wires for the train traverse the upper frame; a utility pole with a small grey box stands prominently on the left. In the bottom-left corner, "Vmax: 80kmh" is displayed.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the tracks towards the tunnel entrance, which steadily grows larger and closer in the distance. The utility pole on the left of the tracks recedes and eventually moves out of view to the left. Concurrently, the rocky terrain on the right scrolls backward, revealing more of its jagged contours and sparse vegetation. A new white and black striped marker pole emerges from the left mid-ground, also moving backward as the train approaches it.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The viewer is positioned on train tracks extending into the midground, leading directly towards a dark tunnel entrance carved into a rocky hillside on the right. To the left, a calm body of water reflects distant mountains and the sky, while the immediate right features a rocky embankment alongside the tracks with overhead catenary wires. A speed indicator "Vmax: 80kmh" is displayed in the bottom left.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses forward along the tracks, causing the rocky embankment on the right and the body of water and mountains on the left to recede and pass by. Catenary poles and wires on the right approach and move past the viewer as the tunnel entrance in the midground steadily grows larger, indicating imminent entry.
