In subsequent frames, the group of pedestrians on the left sidewalk gradually moves closer to the viewer. Concurrently, other individuals further down the sidewalk also show movement, some approaching and some receding, relative to the first-frame viewpoint. The parked cars on the right side of the street, including the dark grey SUV, remain stationary throughout the sequence. Subtle shifts in the shadows on the sidewalk and street are also visible.

Pedestrians walk on the sidewalk, including two individuals prominently in the foreground left, while a dark SUV is partially visible on the far right of the street.
end of description
As the sequence progresses, the two foreground pedestrians walk past the viewer and exit the frame to the left, while other individuals emerge from the background and continue moving along the sidewalk. Concurrently, the dark SUV on the far right moves forward and exits the frame to the right, revealing more of the busy street and stationary vehicles further down the road.

The first frame captures a sunlit city street from a sidewalk perspective. To the left, a storefront with a wooden planter is in the immediate foreground, followed by a concrete sidewalk with pedestrians and other businesses lining the street. A black parking meter with a blue 'P' sign stands in the center-left foreground. On the right, a green-painted bike lane runs parallel to the sidewalk, with a light-colored car parked closest to the viewer, followed by a dark SUV, and a person riding a bicycle further down the lane. Tall buildings dominate the midground and background on both sides of the street under a clear blue sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint subtly shifts forward along the sidewalk. The person on the bicycle moves further away down the green bike lane, gradually receding into the midground. The light-colored car on the right also recedes slightly, while pedestrians on the left sidewalk continue their forward movement, revealing more of the streetscape ahead.
