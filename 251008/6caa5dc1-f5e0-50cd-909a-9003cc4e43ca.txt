The first frame displays a single train track running down the center, covered in snow but with the rails visible, receding into the distance and curving gently to the right. On the left, a dense, dark forest of evergreen trees parallels the track, extending from the midground upwards and into the background. To the right, a mixed forest of bare deciduous trees and scattered evergreens also lines the track, with several small evergreen saplings visible on the snow-covered ground on both sides, all under a bright blue sky with faint clouds overhead.

As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the entire snow-covered landscape and the surrounding forests continuously shift, appearing closer and then receding behind the viewer's original position. A yellow railway sign, initially a distant, indistinct object on the left side of the tracks in the midground, steadily approaches and passes the viewer's first-frame location.

The first frame displays a snowy landscape with train tracks extending centrally into the distant, slightly curving treeline under a bright blue sky. Dense evergreen forests line both sides of the tracks, with some bare deciduous trees also visible on the right. A yellow sign with a black inverted triangle and a 'V' is prominent to the left of the tracks, along with scattered small green saplings in the snow.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the yellow sign travels from the left midground to the foreground before exiting the frame to the left. The continuous movement reveals more of the snowy, sapling-dotted landscape and the surrounding dense forests on both sides, with the tracks steadily leading into the distance.
