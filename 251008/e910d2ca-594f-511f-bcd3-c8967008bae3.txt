The first frame displays a street scene on a sunny day, with a road extending into the distance from the viewer. On the left side of the road, several vehicles are either parked or moving slowly, including a grey SUV closest to the viewer in the foreground. To the right, a sidewalk borders the road, featuring a prominent utility pole adorned with street signs for "Palms," "National Pl," and "National Bl," alongside two green traffic lights. Further back on the right, a 7-Eleven sign is visible, while buildings and trees line both sides of the street under a blue sky.
end of description
The viewer advances forward along the street. The utility pole and its attached street signs and lower traffic light on the immediate right progressively move out of frame to the right, revealing a yellow box with black circles on the sidewalk that was previously partially obscured behind it. Simultaneously, the cars in the left lane move forward, and the 7-Eleven sign and a newly visible speed limit sign (35 mph) appear more distinctly on the right midground, having been previously positioned further away and slightly to the right of the receding utility pole.

The first frame displays a multi-lane road receding uphill into the distance, with a sidewalk on the right featuring a 7-Eleven sign, green benches, a turquoise pickup truck, and a person walking towards the viewer, while the left side has parked cars, buildings, and trees, all beneath a clear blue sky crisscrossed by utility poles and numerous overhead wires.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the viewer's perspective subtly widens, and the person on the right sidewalk advances significantly closer towards the viewer, passing the green benches. Concurrently, the dark SUV previously far up the road moves noticeably closer to the viewer, and a new section of yellow curb paint emerges along the right foreground. Additionally, a partially obscured street sign near the 7-Eleven on the right becomes fully visible, displaying "Baylor" and "The Wave."
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame depicts a residential street ascending uphill under a clear blue sky, marked by a faint contrail. On the left, multi-story buildings and lush green trees line the street, with a few parked cars visible along the curb. To the right, a prominent utility pole with wires stands beside a "SPEED LIMIT 35" sign, followed by more buildings and trees, with several cars parked, including a turquoise pickup truck in the immediate foreground. The asphalt road curves slightly as it climbs, with a distant vehicle visible nearing the crest of the hill.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street, causing the turquoise pickup truck and the utility pole on the right to recede and eventually exit the frame to the viewer's right. Buildings and trees on both sides gradually move closer and then pass the viewer, revealing more of the street ahead. Simultaneously, a dark car enters the frame from the far left, moving into the foreground on the left side of the road, becoming increasingly prominent relative to the initial viewpoint.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
In the first frame, an uphill residential street extends towards the horizon under a clear blue sky with a faint contrail. To the immediate left, a black SUV occupies the foreground, while further back, a row of parked cars and a white RV line the street, bordered by lush green trees and houses, including a building under construction with scaffolding. On the right, a utility pole with power lines and a street light stands prominently, flanked by manicured trees and several parked cars, with houses visible behind them.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the street. The black SUV on the immediate left and the cars parked on both sides of the road recede and gradually exit the frame. A yellow 30 MPH speed limit sign with a steep grade warning becomes newly visible on the right side, attached to the utility pole, as the scene progresses past its initial position. The houses and trees previously in the mid-ground on both sides also move closer and then past the viewer, revealing more of the uphill road ahead.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
In the first frame, a black BMW SUV occupies the lower-left, while a white cargo van and a yellow "steep hill, 30 mph" sign are to the lower-right, parked alongside a dark sedan. An asphalt road extends uphill into the center distance, flanked by lush green trees and obscured buildings on both sides. The background reveals a light blue sky with a faint contrail and distant structures at the horizon.
end of description
The viewer moves forward, causing the black BMW SUV to advance and the white cargo van to exit the frame to the right, revealing a grey car that also moves out of view. The utility pole and a multi-story building on the right become much closer and more detailed. Eventually, a person with a white dog appears on the right sidewalk, walking away from the viewer.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame shows a street scene from a vehicle's perspective, with a black SUV in the lower-left foreground moving away from the viewer. On the right, a sidewalk features a fire hydrant and a person in a light shirt, backed by multi-story buildings and trees with prominent bare trunks, while the left side is lined with green trees and a wall adorned with colorful graffiti. The street extends downhill into the distance under a blue sky.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward, causing the black SUV to recede further down the road. The fire hydrant and person on the right move out of view to the right, revealing more of the buildings with red banners and a "WOODCLYFF" sign, while the graffiti wall on the left also moves into the distance.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame captures a multi-lane road descending into the distance under a clear sky, with a dark SUV directly in front of the viewer. To the left, a building adorned with a colorful mural stands above several parked cars; to the right, utility poles, trees, and buildings displaying "WOODCLIFF" banners line the street.
end of description
Throughout the sequence, both the viewer and the dark SUV move forward along the road, causing objects previously in the foreground to recede further down the street. On the left, more parked cars become visible, followed by a white car and a dark Jeep moving forward parallel to the viewer, revealed from behind the initially visible parked cars. Concurrently, on the right, the "WOODCLIFF" banners and building details become clearer and then gradually shift out of the frame as new sections of the sidewalk and buildings are revealed, indicating continuous forward motion.
