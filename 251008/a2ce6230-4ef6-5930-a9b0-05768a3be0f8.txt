In the first frame, a woman in a black sheer top and light bottoms walks away from the viewer in the foreground, slightly to the right of center. To the left, a large tree trunk with green foliage above stands, featuring a streetlamp and a yellow banner attached to a pole. Further down the path, to the left of the center, another person holds a dark umbrella, walking away, with a red bin partially visible beyond them. To the right, an older man with a cane walks towards the viewer past a building with a "珈琲館" (Coffee-kan) sign. In the midground, a white delivery truck with graphics is positioned further down the street, and in the background, a tall, modern glass building reflects the sky, with various storefronts like SoftBank visible below it.

The woman in the foreground and the person with the umbrella continue walking forward, moving further away from the viewer's initial position. Concurrently, several pedestrians, including the older man with the cane, walk from the right midground towards the viewer, passing the foreground woman before exiting the frame to the right. The white delivery truck in the midground slowly proceeds further away. The yellow banner on the left clarifies its text to "WELCOME TO IKEBUKURO EAST IN THE SUMMER."

A vibrant city street scene unfolds, featuring pedestrians and buildings under a bright sky. In the foreground, a person in a black top and light trousers walks away from the viewer on the right, while another in a green dress with an umbrella proceeds ahead on the left. A prominent tree trunk stands on the far left, and a street pole with a yellow banner displaying "WELCOME TO IKEBUKURO EAST IN THE SUMMER" is positioned in the left mid-ground. Further ahead on the street, a white delivery truck with colorful graphics is parked, backed by a large modern building with a glass facade occupying the right background, featuring several shopfronts including "Coffee-Kan" at street level.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward and subtly pans to the right from its initial position, the yellow banner gradually recedes out of the top left corner of the frame. The tree trunk on the far left becomes more centrally visible before its upper part also moves out of view. Simultaneously, a large, dark advertising display becomes increasingly prominent on the far right, initially to the left of the "Coffee-Kan" sign and then encompassing more of the right edge, revealing more of the street ahead.

The first frame depicts a bustling street, with a person walking away from the viewer in the foreground-center and another on the left holding an umbrella. To their right, a white van is positioned midground, with a tall, modern building and a white delivery truck occupying the background-right, all framed by lush green trees on the left.
end of description
Subsequently, both foreground individuals and the white van move forward and slightly left, gradually receding from the viewer. Simultaneously, a person on a bicycle emerges from the far left, riding behind the umbrella-holder and moving rightwards across the midground, while other background pedestrians also exhibit minor movements.

The first frame captures an urban street scene, with a paved sidewalk featuring a person facing away from the viewer (foreground, slightly right of center) and another holding an umbrella (foreground, left). In the midground, a white van is parked on the street to the left, opposite a large building with glass facades and 'SoftBank' signage on the right, while dense green trees line the street on the far left. A pedestrian also walks towards the viewer from the right side of the midground sidewalk.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the person facing away proceeds forward and slightly left, moving further from the viewer, as does the umbrella-holder to their left. A cyclist emerges from behind the umbrella-holder, also moving away, while the pedestrian on the right sidewalk continues walking towards the viewer.

In the first frame, a paved city sidewalk occupies the foreground, with a person walking away from the viewer on the left and another person in a white shirt and blue pants walking rightward, away from the viewer. A light-colored compact van with its rear hatch open is parked mid-ground on the left, alongside a small covered area where people are seated. To the right, a multi-story modern building with reflective glass windows dominates, featuring ground-floor businesses like SoftBank, while lush green trees line the street further left.
end of description
In the following frames, both pedestrians continue moving away from the viewer; the individual on the left moves deeper into the left midground, and the person on the right proceeds towards the right background. No new objects or scenes are revealed from the first-frame viewpoint.

In the first frame, a white van with its rear side door open is parked slightly to the left of the viewer's center on a paved street. To the far left, a person walks away from the viewer, past a bus stop shelter with seated individuals under leafy green trees. On the right, a tall building with reflective windows and various storefronts, including SoftBank and Y!mobile, rises prominently.
end of description
The white van remains stationary throughout the sequence. The initial pedestrian on the left continues walking away, progressively moving further into the background. Subsequently, another pedestrian, carrying an open umbrella, appears behind the first person on the left and also moves away from the viewer.

In the first frame, a white minivan with its rear passenger door slightly ajar is parked on the right side of a city sidewalk. To its left, two women walk away from the viewer, one with an open umbrella, past a bus stop and dense trees, while tall commercial buildings rise in the background to the right.
end of description
Subsequently, the minivan's rear door opens wider, progressively revealing its interior as the two women continue walking further away from the viewer, moving deeper into the left side of the scene.
