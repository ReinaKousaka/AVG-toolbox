The first frame displays a vibrant urban square at night. To the viewer's immediate right, a dark, multi-level architectural structure with golden strip lights along its edges dominates the foreground, featuring wide steps where two people stand. To the left, a large modern building with a glass facade shines brightly with numerous golden lights. A bustling crowd of people moves across the open paved area in the midground and left, with a yellow taxi visible further back.

The camera gradually pans left, revealing more of the open paved area. A large, brightly lit Christmas tree emerges on the far left of the midground. Subsequently, an intricately lit, hot air balloon-shaped structure becomes fully visible further to the left of the Christmas tree. The crowd of people in the midground continuously shifts, while the two individuals on the steps remain relatively static as the architectural structure on the right recedes slightly.

The first frame depicts a bustling nighttime urban plaza, showcasing a large, golden, hot air balloon-shaped light decoration and illuminated Christmas trees on the left foreground, opposite a wide set of illuminated steps rising to a dark architectural structure on the right. In the background, modern glass buildings glow with golden string lights and exhibit two large, illuminated hot air balloon outlines on their facades, while a dense crowd of pedestrians fills the entire midground.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the camera appears to zoom in slightly, making background details like building signs more prominent and causing the large hot air balloon decoration on the left to appear closer to the frame's edge. Meanwhile, the dense crowd of pedestrians continuously shifts positions, moving closer, further, or across the plaza, but no entirely new objects or scenes are revealed.
