The first frame displays a wet, narrow street in a residential area, lined with buildings under an overcast sky. To the immediate left, a building with traditional white patterned walls and brown wooden trim features steps in the foreground. Further down the left side, a brick building is visible with a small tree in front of it and a yellow-and-black striped utility pole on the street's edge. On the right, a traditional Korean house with a dark tiled roof and an ornate black and gold gate stands, accompanied by white flowers in pots in the foreground and orange flowers near the gate. The wet street recedes into the distance, where a faint figure walks away from the viewer.

As the frames progress, the scene remains rainy, with water increasingly pooling and flowing visibly on the street, especially along the left curb near the steps. From the far right foreground, a white car slowly backs into view, gradually revealing its front bumper and headlight as it continues its reverse movement. The figure in the distant background remains largely stationary as the rain persists.

The first frame presents a wet, narrow asphalt street bordered by buildings, receding into the distance under a cloudy sky. On the left, a brick wall and a tree lead to a building, while a traditional dark gate and a weathered white wall with a '43-1' sign stand on the right. A manhole cover and a white cross are visible on the wet road in the foreground, and a person holding an umbrella walks away in the far background.

Throughout the subsequent frames, heavy rain continuously falls, causing more water to visibly pool and flow across the street surface from the viewpoint, especially accumulating on the left side of the road, as the person with the umbrella continues to walk further into the background.

The first frame shows a wet, narrow street or alleyway extending away from the viewer under an overcast sky. To the left, a multi-story brick building with windows is visible, with a lower brick wall and green foliage in front of it, and a utility pole with yellow and black stripes in the mid-ground. To the right, a rough, decaying concrete wall with various signs, including one marked '43-1', stands alongside a low stone wall. In the mid-ground, a person holding a black umbrella walks away from the viewer, moving down the center of the wet street.
end of description
Throughout the subsequent frames, the person holding the umbrella continues to slowly walk further away from the viewer, moving deeper into the alleyway. The scene remains static otherwise, with the constant wetness indicating ongoing rain, but no new objects or scenes are revealed.
