The first frame shows a snow-covered path extending from the viewer into a wooded area. Snow-laden evergreen trees line both sides of the path, with a bright, overcast sky visible above them. In the midground, an orange flag is planted in the snow on the path, with two figures beyond it: one in dark clothing slightly left of center, and another in a red/purple jacket to their right, both walking away from the viewer. Further in the background, a small wooden cabin is visible on the right, nestled among more trees. Digital overlays are present on the bottom right and left.
end of description
The two individuals initially in the midground continue walking away from the viewer along the snow path, with the person in the red jacket moving further to the right relative to the path. The viewer advances, causing the orange flag on the path to approach, and the individual in dark clothing shifts slightly to the right, becoming more centrally aligned on the path. The person in the red jacket eventually exits the frame to the right, and colorful blue and yellow poles become visible further ahead on the right side of the path. The viewer continues moving forward, passing the orange flag, revealing more of the snowy landscape and distant cabins beyond the initial positions of the figures.
