As the frames progress, visible streaks of falling rain intensify the damp atmosphere. A red traffic light illuminates further down the street on the left side of the first-frame viewpoint. Finally, a blue bus enters from the right side, traversing leftwards across the wet road in the mid-ground of the scene.

The first frame displays a wet, rainy city street at night. A paved sidewalk occupies the left foreground, featuring a pile of dark and white garbage bags at the base of a tall, dark vertical pole that stands prominently. Beyond this, illuminated storefronts with Korean text, green trees, and red traffic lights line the street on the left. To the right of the central pole, a reflective, wet asphalt road stretches into the distance, marked with yellow lines and mirroring numerous streetlights. A blue bus is partially visible on the road in the midground-right, facing towards the viewer's right.

The blue bus initially seen in the midground-right begins to move from right to left, passing behind the central dark pole and continuing down the street. As the first bus moves away, a second blue bus becomes visible in the midground behind it, also traveling from right to left. Throughout these movements, the reflections of streetlights and vehicle lights on the wet road continuously shift and gleam.

The first frame displays a rain-soaked street at night. A thick, dark utility pole stands prominently on the right, with several white trash bags piled at its base. To the left, a wet sidewalk stretches into the background, bordered by buildings featuring glowing signs. The center reveals a reflective wet asphalt road, marked by a yellow line near the sidewalk, where distant vehicles and red traffic lights are visible, their reflections shimmering alongside various streetlights. Trees with green foliage are scattered along both sides of the street under a dark sky.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint slowly pans to the left, revealing more of the wet sidewalk and the storefronts lining the left side of the street, including a bicycle parked further down. The dark pole, initially prominent on the right, gradually shifts towards the far right edge, uncovering previously obscured portions of the road and buildings across the street from the first-frame's perspective. Vehicles continue to be visible on the reflective road in the mid-distance.
