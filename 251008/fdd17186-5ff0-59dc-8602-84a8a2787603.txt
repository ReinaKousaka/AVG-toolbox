To the immediate left, a wooden fence and a densely covered ivy wall line a narrow stream. A winding asphalt road occupies the mid-ground, with a long, light-colored stone house featuring multiple windows and a gray door positioned to its right, behind a low stone wall and gravel driveway. In the background, other stone houses and a blue car are visible further down the road on the left, beneath bare trees.

Subsequently, the camera moves forward and to the right, gradually revealing more of the main stone house on the right, including a new dormer window on its far right side. The foreground fence and ivy-covered wall on the left progressively move out of frame, exposing more of the road's left edge as the viewpoint shifts past them.

The first frame displays a row of traditional stone houses with layered tiled roofs, occupying the mid-ground and background from the mid-right to the left. The prominent central house features multiple gray-framed windows and a light gray front door, with a small thatched awning above a window to its right. To the far right, a portion of another house with a distinct dormer window is visible, showing more moss on its roof. A low dry-stone wall runs across the bottom left foreground, bordering a narrow road or path, while a gravel area is in front of the central house. Bare trees stand in the background behind the houses against an overcast sky.

The camera slowly pans to the left, causing the dry-stone wall and road to extend further into the foreground from the left. A blue car gradually emerges from behind the leftmost house, appearing in the mid-left of the scene. Simultaneously, the rightmost house and its dormer window move out of the frame to the far right. The remaining houses shift towards the center, revealing more of their left facades.
