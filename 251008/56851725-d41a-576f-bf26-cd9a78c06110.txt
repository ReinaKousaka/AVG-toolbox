In the first frame, an autumnal forest fills the view, with dark, mossy tree branches displaying orange-yellow leaves extending from the upper left and right, and long green vines hanging centrally in the foreground. Behind these, a dense midground and background are populated by numerous bare trees and scattered foliage in hues of yellow, orange, and red across a sloping forest floor. A small, flowing river is visible along the bottom left edge of the frame.

Over the subsequent frames, the viewpoint subtly pans downwards and slightly right, progressively revealing more of the flowing river, which now extends further into the bottom left and center of the scene relative to its initial position.

The first frame presents an autumnal forest scene. In the foreground, a river flows from the left towards the mid-ground, featuring visible dark rocks and white rapids. To the left of the river, a bank rises, showcasing a small tree with bright yellow leaves positioned in the mid-ground, backed by a line of taller, mostly bare trees with some scattered orange foliage further behind it. The central and right portions of the frame are dominated by a sloping forest floor, extending from the mid-ground into the background, covered with fallen leaves and moss, interspersed with numerous bare tree trunks. Closer to the viewer, within this forested area, several trees have distinctive long, green, drooping tendrils, while golden leaves from branches enter the frame from the upper left and upper right.

Subsequently, the river's water, positioned in the left foreground and mid-ground relative to the initial viewpoint, demonstrates continuous downstream flow, creating dynamic ripples and white rapids around the stationary dark rocks. Aside from this water movement, the forest landscape, including all trees and the forest floor, remains unchanged throughout the sequence.
