The first frame shows a sunny city intersection. In the foreground, a dark asphalt road leads to a pedestrian crossing marked "LOOK RIGHT" on the right, with a grey sidewalk and several dark bollards to the left, where a green bike is also visible. In the midground, a white van is crossing from left to right, while another white van with a red stripe and a blue car are positioned further right, partially out of frame. A man in a light shirt walks away from the viewer across the pedestrian crossing, with various city buildings, including a tall modern structure on the left and an ornate historical building on the right, forming the background under a blue sky.

The white van on the left proceeds further right, displaying its 'BW ELECTRICAL' branding, as the man in the light shirt continues walking away from the viewer. Concurrently, the white van and blue car on the right exit the frame, moving further to the right. Subsequently, a grey sedan enters from the left, traversing the intersection behind the walking man, while distant pedestrians also shift their positions.
