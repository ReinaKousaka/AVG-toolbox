In the first frame, the viewer looks down an urban street. To the immediate right, a man in a dark suit with a black backpack is visible from behind, slightly left of the frame's center. To his left, the back of a woman with long, light brown hair and a red handbag is seen. On the far right, two outdoor cafe tables with red menu stands and light blue chairs are present beside a modern building with large reflective glass and metallic panels. To the left, a covered walkway with dark pillars and light blue panels extends into the distance, with several pedestrians walking away from the viewer and one person in a striped shirt walking towards the viewer further down the path. Tall buildings line both sides of the street, and trees are visible above the walkway on the left.

The man in the suit and the woman in the foreground consistently move forward and slightly to the left relative to the first-frame viewpoint, gradually revealing more of the street ahead and the cafe area on the right recedes. Simultaneously, the viewer's perspective advances, causing new pedestrians to appear from further ahead on the left walkway and move towards the first-frame viewpoint, including a man in a grey shirt and then a man in a light suit. As the primary figures move forward, the overall street scene further ahead becomes more prominent and defined.

The first frame depicts a street scene viewed from just behind a man in a dark suit wearing a black backpack, who occupies the central-right foreground. To the immediate right, a metallic building facade is partially visible, while to the immediate left, a dark structure with light blue panels is present. Further into the midground, a man in a grey suit walks towards the viewer on the left, with other pedestrians scattered along the path and across the street, where a traffic light glows red. Tall, modern buildings with many windows line both sides of the street, receding into the background.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the man in the grey suit passes the viewer to the left. Progressively, two women, one in a trench coat and another in a patterned dress, emerge from behind the blue panels on the far left, walking towards and past the viewer. Concurrently, the traffic light in the midground changes from red to green, while a woman in a red coat, previously further down the street, approaches the viewer. The continuous forward movement reveals more of the street and the constant flow of pedestrians, altering the perspective on the surrounding buildings.
