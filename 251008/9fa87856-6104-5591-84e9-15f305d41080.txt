In the first frame, a wet brick sidewalk extends from the bottom center into the distance. To the far left, a white storefront with a blue awning and several signs is visible, bordering the sidewalk. A woman holding a light pink umbrella stands in the midground right, facing left, near a yellow traffic light pole, which is next to a large tree trunk on the right side of the frame. Beyond the sidewalk on the left, numerous green trees line what appears to be a park or green space, with some brown-roofed structures nestled amongst them. To the far right, a wet asphalt road with a white crosswalk is visible, and in the distant background, apartment buildings rise under a cloudy sky.

The camera slowly pans to the right, gradually revealing more of the wet asphalt road and the crosswalk that were previously to the right of the first frame's edge. Further to the right, additional distant apartment buildings emerge into view as the perspective shifts. The prominent white pole in the foreground right becomes more central, and a second, smaller black pole behind the main traffic signal pole is also gradually revealed to the right of its initial position.

The first frame depicts a person holding a pink umbrella on a wet brick sidewalk in the midground, looking slightly left. To the left, a flooded path leads past green trees to a small red-roofed structure in the background; to the right, a utility pole with traffic lights, black bollards, and a tree trunk frame a wet crosswalk and asphalt road, with buildings visible in the far distance.

In the following frames, the heavy rain visibly continues to fall across the entire scene, causing ripples on the wet ground. The person under the umbrella makes subtle adjustments, occasionally tilting the pink umbrella more to the right before leveling it again, while otherwise remaining stationary relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
