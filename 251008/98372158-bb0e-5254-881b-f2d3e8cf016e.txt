From the first-frame viewpoint, a multi-lane road extends forward under a sunset sky, flanked by barriers on the left with a partially visible red car and trees, and a guardrail with green foliage, a street lamp, and a green bicycle on the right. Distant buildings line both sides of the road, and a navigation map is visible in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the road, the red car on the left recedes, revealing a blue car partially behind it, while the green bicycle on the right also moves out of view. Concurrently, a tall street lamp post and a red and blue "no parking" sign on the right side emerge more fully into the frame, becoming increasingly prominent as other vehicles ahead maintain their relative positions.
frame_0000000128-frame_0000000256:
In the first frame, the viewer is on a multi-lane road looking forward. A black car is visible in the middle distance ahead, with another car further to its right. To the left, a median barrier with flower planters separates the lanes from another section of road, where a red car is seen. A row of trees and distant buildings line the left side. On the right, a blue rectangular road sign with white straight-ahead arrows is mounted on a pole above a dense line of trees, behind which buildings are also visible in the distance. The sky is clear above, and a navigation map overlay is in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the scene progresses, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The black car ahead recedes further into the distance, while the blue road sign on the right approaches, growing larger and revealing more of its support pole. White straight-ahead arrows painted on the road surface appear in the foreground and pass beneath the viewer. A white car, initially behind the red car on the left, becomes more prominent as both vehicles recede relative to the advancing viewpoint, while the streetlights and trees along both sides pass by.
frame_0000000256-frame_0000000384:
The first frame presents a straight multi-lane road extending directly in front of the viewer, flanked by rows of trees and streetlights on both sides. A black car is visible on the road ahead of the viewer, moving away. A central divider with barriers runs to the left of the viewer, while a white fence lines the road to the right. In the distance, buildings are visible to the front-left and front-right. An overlay map is situated in the top-left corner, and a "no left turn" sign with a "yield" sign is mounted on a pole to the right of the road.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward along the road. The initial traffic signs on the right recede past the viewer. Planters with purple flowers become visible on the central divider to the front-left, and a traditional-style building appears on the front-right, further down the road. Further forward movement reveals a bus stop shelter and a motorcycle on the right, as well as a more prominent view of the bridge structure to the front-left, all continuously receding as the viewer advances.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame shows a multi-lane road extending into the distance with a red car ahead, flanked by a tree-lined median and buildings on the left, and a sidewalk with a bus stop, a person, and a motorbike on the right, under a clear sky with a map overlay in the top left corner.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, road markings including a white arrow become visible directly in front. The bus stop, person, and motorbike on the right move towards and then behind the viewer, revealing more of the buildings and a clearer overhead blue sign. The red car ahead also appears closer to the viewer.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame displays a multi-lane road extending into the distance, with a green median barrier and purple flowers to the left, and a sidewalk lined with trees and a metal barrier to the right. Ahead on the road, a red car is central, followed by other vehicles further ahead, under a blue street sign and traffic lights hanging over the right lane. On the far right, a bus stop shelter with a person standing next to it is visible, while buildings line both sides of the street in the midground and background, under a clear, pale sky. A circular map overlay is present in the top-left corner.
end of description
The viewpoint progresses forward along the road. The red car ahead recedes slightly, remaining in front of the first-frame viewpoint. The blue street sign, initially ahead and on the right, gets closer, passes overhead, and then appears further to the right and increasingly behind the first-frame viewpoint. A white sedan enters the scene from the lower left, moving past the viewer's initial left side and continuing forward in the adjacent lane. Consequently, the bus stop and person initially on the right move out of view to the right and behind the first-frame viewpoint, with more green bicycles becoming visible on the right sidewalk ahead.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame displays a multi-lane city road from a driver's perspective, with a white sedan positioned ahead and to the left, and a dark SUV further ahead in the viewer's lane. To the left, a median with barriers, flower planters, and traffic lights precede buildings partially obscured by trees; to the right, a sidewalk with trees, pedestrians, and green shared bikes parallels the road, with distant buildings under a clear sky, all while a circular map overlay appears in the top-left corner.
end of description
As the viewer's vehicle advances, the white sedan ahead and to the left pulls further forward and begins to turn left, while the dark SUV ahead also moves forward. Concurrently, roadside elements such as the flower planters and trees recede backward, the traffic lights on the left transition from red to green, and a pedestrian on the right crosses the street.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The viewer is positioned on a multi-lane road, facing forward behind a dark SUV, with a white sedan slightly to its left. Ahead, a red traffic light illuminates an intersection where pedestrians are crossing from the right sidewalk towards the left. Tall buildings and lush trees line both sides of the urban street, stretching into the distance under a clear, light-blue sky, complemented by a navigation map in the top-left.
end of description
Throughout the sequence, the brake lights of both the dark SUV and the white sedan ahead illuminate and dim intermittently while they remain stationary. Pedestrians continue traversing the crosswalk directly ahead from the right, and a motorcyclist also emerges from the far right to proceed across the intersection, moving away from the viewer.
