To the viewer's immediate left, a low stone wall extends into the mid-ground, partially obscuring a stone building with a white window and a slate roof. Beyond this wall and building, to the left, parked cars are visible behind a hedge. In the center and to the right, a paved road with a yellow double line curves into the distance, flanked by a wooden utility pole near the viewer and a continuous green hedge further along. White houses and tall trees line the road in the mid-ground and background, with hills visible under an overcast sky.

The camera slowly pans right and moves slightly forward, causing the stone wall on the left to recede from the foreground. As the perspective shifts, the stone building and parked cars to the left become more revealed. A person subsequently emerges from behind the parked cars, to the left of the original viewpoint, walking towards the road.

A stone wall borders the lower left foreground, alongside a paved sidewalk and a dark road curving right into the distance, marked by a double yellow line. A utility pole stands on the sidewalk, while behind the wall to the left are parked cars, buildings, and trees; across the road, distant houses and a construction area are visible under a cloudy sky.

The viewpoint progresses forward, causing the stone wall and the utility pole on the left to gradually recede and move out of the frame. As the camera advances, the parked cars and buildings behind the wall on the left move further away, while the road, houses, and construction site on the right side of the road appear closer and more centralized.

From the viewer's perspective, a stone wall runs along the lower left foreground, with a dark utility pole obscuring part of it on the far left. A paved road with a yellow double line on its right edge stretches from the bottom center towards the distance, accompanied by a sidewalk between the wall and the road. To the left, beyond the wall, are parked cars partially hidden by large trees and a green hedge. Across the road on the right, houses with white walls and dark roofs are visible, along with a tall evergreen tree and a construction area marked by orange cones. In the background, green hills are seen under a cloudy sky.
end of description
The camera slightly shifts forward. A silver SUV enters the frame from the mid-ground right of the road, moving away from the viewer. The SUV proceeds down the road, passing the construction area on the right, and continues receding into the distance towards the left along the curving road.
