The first frame captures a rainy city street from a low sidewalk perspective. To the left, a building with a red awning and potted plants borders a green-painted path where two individuals stand under umbrellas. Centrally, a large white patio umbrella extends over another person, with a fourth individual holding an umbrella closer to the right foreground, near a tree trunk and traffic pole, overlooking a wet street with traffic and distant buildings.

The camera then slowly shifts right and slightly zooms out. This movement gradually reveals more of the street, a black traffic control box, and background buildings to the right, while the leftmost building and the initial foreground tree trunk partially move out of the frame.

The first frame depicts a rainy street scene from a sidewalk, featuring a brown planter box and green-painted path to the viewer's left, leading to a wet street with a white crosswalk. Three individuals with umbrellas are visible: a man in a light blue shirt and mask on the far left, another person with a black umbrella partially under a large white patio umbrella in the center, and a person in a green top on the far right. In the background, tall buildings and trees line the street where a white car is visible further down, under an overcast sky.

Throughout the frames, the man on the far left subtly adjusts his dark umbrella and stance. The person near the large white umbrella struggles as their black umbrella is repeatedly buffeted and twisted by the wind, notably from frame 3 onwards. Concurrently, the individual on the far right makes minor adjustments to their black umbrella and body. In the background, a white car slowly advances along the wet street.
