The first frame displays a multi-lane urban road extending into the distance under a blue sky dotted with white clouds. To the left, a manicured green hedge with some pink flowers runs alongside the road, behind which a green bus is partially visible in the midground. On the far right foreground, a white and green sanitation truck is parked, while a grassy median with trees separates the road from tall skyscrapers that dominate the midground and background, including a prominent twin-towered building on the right.
end of description
The green bus, initially behind the hedge on the left, moves forward through the midground. Concurrently, the sanitation truck on the far right in the foreground proceeds forward and eventually moves out of frame to the right. A white car appears in the middle lanes of the road in the midground, moving forward towards the viewer, as another white vehicle subsequently enters from the far right foreground.

The first frame depicts a wide urban road stretching from the foreground into the distance under a blue sky with white clouds. On the right, towering residential buildings line the street, bordered by a strip of trees and a street light pole, with a light-colored car visible in the mid-ground. The left side features a long green hedge separating the main road from another parallel road where traffic and a large overhead sign structure are visible, leading towards more distant skyscrapers.
end of description
As the camera moves forward, the large overhead sign on the far left recedes and gradually moves out of the top left of the frame. The light-colored car in the right lane continues to move further away, and new vehicles, including a motorcycle, become visible behind it and on the adjacent road to the left, all moving generally away from the viewer. The red fire hydrant on the right also recedes into the distance, demonstrating the continuous forward motion through the urban landscape.

In the first frame, a wide multi-lane city road stretches into the distance under a blue sky with scattered clouds. A green median strip with bushes and a barrier runs along the left side, separating the viewer's lane from an oncoming lane lined with palm trees and buildings. To the right, towering apartment buildings rise high, bordered by trees, with a white car in the rightmost lane heading away from the viewer. Numerous skyscrapers populate the distant horizon, forming a dense urban skyline.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward, the white car on the right moves further into the distance. A new circular gray sign and a street light pole gradually emerge on the far left side of the median, approaching the viewer. Simultaneously, a blue car in the left lane ahead and a red car parked to the far right become clearer as the scene shifts closer to them.
frame_0000000384-frame_0000000512:
The first frame displays a wide urban street extending into the distance under a bright blue sky with white clouds. Tall, modern high-rise buildings line both sides of the road, with the most prominent and largest situated on the right side in the middle ground and foreground. The multi-lane road, marked with white lines, is divided by a lush green median adorned with bushes and patches of pink flowers. In the foreground on the right lane, a white and blue taxi-like car is visible, while several other vehicles, including a blue car, are further back in the left-side lanes for oncoming traffic. Trees border the sidewalks on both sides, and blue road signs are visible above the median in the middle distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the white and blue car in the right foreground recedes and eventually exits the frame to the right, while the blue car and other vehicles on the left also move further into the distance relative to the initial viewpoint. Continuously, new vehicles enter the frame from the foreground on both sides, progressing along the road. Notably, a white car appears on the far left, and a black car enters the right foreground lane towards the end of the sequence, all relative to the initially established street layout.
frame_0000000512-frame_0000000640:
The first frame captures a multi-lane city road receding into the distance under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds. A green median adorned with pink flowering bushes separates the lanes on the left, running alongside traffic, including a beige bus in the midground and various cars. On the right, tall apartment buildings line the street, with two blue overhead road signs indicating directions; a black sports car is partially visible in the foreground on the far right, and a scooter rider is further ahead in the same lane. Numerous skyscrapers define the urban skyline in the background, with a very tall, slender building centrally positioned in the distant horizon.
end of description.
As the viewer moves forward, the road surface and the median's flowering bushes flow beneath, while the black sports car on the far right recedes. Vehicles ahead, including the scooter, draw closer before the viewer passes them. The blue road signs on the right approach, revealing a '40' speed limit sign beneath the rightmost one, and a construction site with a large crane on the far left becomes more prominent. New sections of the sidewalk, additional parked cars, and details of the buildings on both sides progressively enter the frame as the scene advances.
frame_0000000640-frame_0000000768:
The first frame captures a forward view along a wide paved road extending into a bustling city under a blue, cloudy sky. To the left, a raised median adorned with green foliage and pink flowers separates the viewer's lane from a parallel road exhibiting moderate traffic, including a white car and a bus. On the right, two prominent blue street signs for "Shennan Blvd" and "Baishi Rd" are visible, with a "40" speed limit sign beneath them, alongside a moped carrying two individuals, two large yellow dump trucks, a parked black car, and various urban buildings, including a tall, slender skyscraper centrally located in the distance.
end of description
As the frames progress, the viewer moves forward along the road, causing the initial street signs and speed limit sign on the right to ascend and exit the frame. Concurrently, the moped, the black parked car, and the two yellow dump trucks on the right move closer before progressively exiting the scene to the right. On the left, the white car and other vehicles advance closer to the viewer before passing out of the frame, revealing more of the cityscape ahead as the perspective shifts forward.
frame_0000000768-frame_0000000896:
The first frame depicts a multi-lane elevated highway stretching into the distance under a bright blue sky with white clouds. To the viewer's left, a lower road segment is visible, bordered by lush green bushes and vibrant pink flowers, with a black car driving away. On the right, a similar floral barrier accompanies the highway, near which a large yellow construction vehicle is partially seen, and a person on a yellow motorcycle rides further ahead. A dense urban landscape of numerous skyscrapers dominates the background, with a particularly tall, slender building centrally located in the far distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the highway, the black car on the lower left road proceeds further away, while a blue car subsequently appears on the same road, following it. The yellowish construction equipment on the right gradually moves out of frame, replaced by more of the barrier and flowers. The motorcyclist continues to recede into the distance on the main road. Concurrently, a new white car emerges on the main road to the left, moving forward past the viewer's initial position, as the overall cityscape appears to shift subtly towards the viewer.
