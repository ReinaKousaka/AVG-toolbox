The first frame shows a narrow, uphill cobblestone street lined with colorful buildings. On the left, a reddish-brown building features a shop window, potted plants, and a lamppost, while flags, including Ukrainian, hang further up the street. On the right, a yellow building has outdoor cafe seating, signs, and a streetlamp; several pedestrians and a white van are visible moving away from the viewer in the distance.

In subsequent frames, the camera subtly zooms out and slightly pans left, revealing more of the potted plants on the sidewalk to the left. Concurrently, pedestrians continue moving further up the street, away from the viewer's original position, and the white van also proceeds slowly away in the distance.
