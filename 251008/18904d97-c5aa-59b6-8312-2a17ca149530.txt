The first frame depicts a wet street in a mountain village, with a large, traditional wooden building featuring a storefront and red banners dominating the midground under a cloudy, mountainous sky in the background. To the right, a person with an orange umbrella walks away from the viewer, beside a reddish-leafed tree and a wooden bench with flowers, while individuals with yellow and light green umbrellas are near the building's entrance moving left, and a group with pink and blue umbrellas approaches from the far left on the street.
