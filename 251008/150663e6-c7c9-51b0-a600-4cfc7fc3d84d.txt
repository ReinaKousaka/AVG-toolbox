The first frame captures a densely packed urban street scene at night, with numerous pedestrians walking primarily away from the viewer towards the background and slightly to the right. To the viewer's left, a large illuminated glass storefront reflects the bustling city, while to the right, a busy street with buses and cars is visible beneath towering buildings adorned with a multitude of glowing billboards and advertisements.

Throughout the subsequent frames, the entire crowd of people, including those closest to the viewer in the foreground, continually shifts and moves forward, gradually revealing more of the street ahead and the bustling city activity beyond the initial foreground. Pedestrians on both the left and right sides of the immediate foreground move further into view or depart the frame, demonstrating a constant flow of human traffic. The vehicles and distant billboards also exhibit minor movements, maintaining the dynamic street atmosphere relative to the first-frame viewpoint.
