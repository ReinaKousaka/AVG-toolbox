The first frame displays a cobblestone alley extending forward, bordered by a red brick building with white windows on the left and a modern white-framed building with reflective glass panels on the right. At the distant end of the alley, a traditional timber-framed building with a red roof and white windows is visible.
end of description
As the viewpoint progresses forward through the alley, the black graffiti spelling 'Romek' on the brick wall to the left becomes distinctly clearer, and a circular blue graphic or reflection becomes visible and moves across the glass panels on the right, as the distant timber-framed building appears larger.

A narrow cobblestone alley leads away from the viewer, bordered by a red brick wall with graffiti on the left and a modern building with a multi-paned glass facade on the right. Further ahead, a small green bush grows against the left wall, and a traditional half-timbered building with a red-tiled roof is visible at the end of the alley.
end of description
The viewpoint slowly advances forward through the alley. As the viewer moves, the graffiti on the left brick wall recedes, and the half-timbered building in the distance subtly appears closer and slightly larger.

A cobblestone path extends from the viewer into the distance, flanked by buildings on either side. To the left, a brick wall runs towards the background, featuring several windows and a small green bush near its base in the middle ground. To the right, a modern building with numerous rectangular glass panels and white frames curves slightly inward, reflecting the surroundings. In the background, a traditional half-timbered house with many white-framed windows stands prominently, nestled amongst some greenery.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the cobblestone path appears closer and more detailed. The small bush on the left grows larger and moves into the foreground, revealing more of its roots. Simultaneously, both the brick wall on the left and the modern building on the right extend further towards the viewer's immediate left and right, respectively, exposing new lower sections of their facades. The half-timbered house in the background remains visible, subtly growing in apparent size as the viewer approaches.

The first frame depicts a cobblestone path curving gently left, flanked by a brick building with a large green bush on the left, and a modern glass-paneled building on the right, leading towards a half-timbered building in the background.
end of description
As the viewpoint subtly advances and shifts slightly left in subsequent frames, the large green bush on the left recedes further from the viewer, revealing more of the brick wall and some faint graffiti near its base. Further back on the left, a light-colored fence or panel behind the bush becomes more visible. The reflections on the modern glass building to the right dynamically change, and the half-timbered building in the background appears marginally closer.

The first frame displays a cobbled path extending forward, bordered on the left by a red brick wall, a green bush, and a wooden fence with a garbage bin, and on the right by a modern building with reflective windows. In the background, a half-timbered building with numerous white windows stands behind central green bushes. end of description. As the viewer moves forward along the path, the modern building on the right recedes from view, while the half-timbered building and the path ahead become more prominent. A street lamp, previously obscured, is gradually revealed in the mid-background to the right of the central bushes.
