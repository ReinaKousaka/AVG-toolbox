The first frame shows a wet paved path extending from the viewer into the midground, flanked by green grass on both sides and large trees. To the left, a dark park bench and trash can are situated near the path, while to the right, two figures sit on a bench under an open black umbrella. Beyond the park, a bustling street with multiple cars and pedestrians at a crosswalk occupies the midground, backed by multi-story buildings.

From frame 2 through 6, a dark, umbrella-like object appears from the top of the frame, progressively moving downwards to obscure the upper portion of the scene. This object then recedes upwards and exits the frame by the seventh frame, fully revealing the previous view. Throughout these changes, vehicles move across the street in the midground, and several pedestrians, many with umbrellas, traverse the crosswalk on the left. The two individuals under the umbrella on the right side of the path remain seated and mostly stationary.

The first frame depicts a wet city park scene with a dark path extending towards a busy street ahead. A park bench is on wet grass to the left foreground, while people are partially visible under an umbrella to the far right. Across the midground street, cars move and pedestrians cross a white crosswalk, with multiple-story buildings and verdant trees filling the background.

Subsequently, pedestrians on the crosswalk and sidewalk continuously move from left to right, and vehicles proceed along the street, with a red car crossing from left to right becoming more prominent. The traffic light on the left cycles from red to green and then back to red, with slight shifts also occurring in the dark overhang at the top of the frames.
