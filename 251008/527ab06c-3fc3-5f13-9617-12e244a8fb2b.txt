The first frame depicts a rainy street scene with a wet sidewalk on the left, lined with trees and illuminated storefronts, and a wet road on the right. Three individuals holding umbrellas are walking away from the viewer on the sidewalk, while a white pickup truck is partially visible on the far right of the road, and another white car is further down.

As the frames progress, the three people on the sidewalk continue to move further away from the viewer, and the white pickup truck on the right side of the road drives past and exits the frame to the right. The white car further down the road also advances away from the viewer. Towards the end, a new person in a light raincoat carrying a blue umbrella appears from the far left foreground, walking towards the viewer, as the rain continues.

The first frame displays a rainy, tree-lined street with a wet sidewalk extending from the left foreground, where a person with a blue umbrella is partially visible. Two people carrying umbrellas walk away from the viewer along this sidewalk into the mid-ground, opposite a white car driving further away on the wet road to the right, past distant buildings.
end of description
As frames progress, the viewpoint moves forward, revealing more of the person with the blue umbrella and introducing a new man holding a dark umbrella, entering from behind the viewer to the right. As these figures advance into the mid-ground, the original two people and the white car recede further into the background. A new distant silhouette, also holding an umbrella, becomes visible behind the original pair as they walk away.

The first frame shows the back of a person in a light green hooded jacket, holding a blue umbrella, positioned in the left foreground. The wet sidewalk extends from the bottom towards the distance, with another person holding a black umbrella walking away from the viewer in the mid-ground, slightly to the right of the first person. A tree and a pole stand on the right side of the sidewalk, next to a wet road where a white car is visible in the distance, moving away. Buildings are present on the left and in the background, all under heavy rain.
end of description
The two prominent figures in the foreground and mid-ground continue walking away from the viewer along the wet sidewalk. A woman in a black top and white shorts emerges from behind the person with the black umbrella, further down the sidewalk, eventually holding a transparent umbrella as she moves away from the first-frame viewpoint. Simultaneously, the white car on the road progresses further into the distance, with another white car appearing behind it, also moving away. A new pedestrian also appears further down the sidewalk to the right, holding a transparent umbrella and moving away.
