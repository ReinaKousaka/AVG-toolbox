The first frame presents a wet, paved park path curving slightly to the right from the bottom center into the mid-distance, marked by a white line. To the viewer's immediate left, a dense green hedge borders the path, behind which a body of water with vertical posts extends into the mid-ground. Further left in the background, a bridge-like structure is visible. To the viewer's right, a thinner line of green bushes parallels the path, with a small white sign and an open-sided gazebo containing benches nestled among trees in the mid-ground. Numerous green trees form the backdrop, under an overcast sky, with rain visibly falling.

The viewpoint slowly advances forward along the path. The green hedge on the left moves slightly to reveal more of the water body beyond it, while the gazebo on the right gradually recedes into the mid-background. The overall scene remains consistent, with rain continuing to fall as the camera subtly progresses along the wet pathway.

The first frame displays a wet, curving paved path, lined by green hedges, leading towards a park with numerous trees under a bright sky, while a covered shelter with benches and a prominent tree trunk are visible to the right of the path.
end of description
Progressing forward, the viewpoint moves along the path. The left hedge gradually recedes and exits the frame, simultaneously, the shelter and large tree on the right approach, pass by, and eventually move behind and to the right of the initial viewpoint. The path ahead continues its gentle curve, revealing more of the verdant park and bringing the distant white sign closer into view. Throughout this movement, rain continues to fall, maintaining the wet sheen on the surfaces.

The first frame depicts a wet paved path, likely a walking or cycling trail, curving gently to the left and receding into the background. Lush green bushes line both sides of the path, with a dense forest of trees filling the distant background. To the right of the path, a wooden shelter with two benches stands, partially obscured by a tree trunk in the foreground, and a white signpost is visible further along the path amidst the bushes.
end of description
Throughout the sequence, the camera subtly pulls back, gradually widening the view of the path and the surrounding park environment. The 'Rain Everyday' watermark in the bottom-left corner also appears slightly larger in later frames. Noticeably, the visual evidence of falling rain becomes more pronounced, with increased ripples and reflections visible on the wet path surface.
