The first frame displays an ancient ruined street under a clear blue sky. To the immediate left, a grassy patch with scattered stones borders a sturdy, decaying stone wall that features an alcove and extends forward and into the distance. To the right, a wide, unevenly cobbled stone path stretches into the background, flanked by a row of similarly ruined stone structures. In the mid-background along this path, several small human figures are visible, and in the far background, a mountain is silhouetted against the horizon.

The viewpoint subtly shifts forward and slightly to the right, gradually revealing more of the cobbled street and the ruined structures on its right side. Existing human figures on the path appear to move further into the background, receding from the initial viewpoint. A woman in a dark green dress and a man in a black shirt, initially in the mid-background right, advance closer to the foreground right. A new person wearing a yellow top emerges into view further down the path, in the background right. Additionally, a brown metal beam on the left ruined wall slowly becomes more central in the frame as the viewpoint progresses.
