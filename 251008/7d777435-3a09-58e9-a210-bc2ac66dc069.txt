In the first frame, a street slopes uphill from the viewer, with a white Volkswagen Polo partially visible in the immediate foreground on the bottom left. On the left side, a row of multi-story yellow/orange houses with dark balconies rises behind a stone wall and fence, interspersed with bare trees. On the right, a parallel row of brightly colored houses (red, green, brown) stands behind similar walls and fences, with a lamppost and another bare tree situated closer to the viewer. The distant background shows more houses and parked cars under a grey, overcast sky.

As the viewer moves forward up the street, the white car initially in the foreground on the left recedes and then moves entirely out of frame, revealing the road surface and markings it previously obscured. The rows of yellow/orange houses on the left and the colorful houses on the right become progressively closer and more detailed. Simultaneously, new parked cars appear further down the left side of the street, moving closer to the viewer's advancing position.

The first frame presents a view down a residential street under an overcast sky. On the left, a grey car is parked alongside a stone wall in front of several yellow houses with dark windows and balconies; a tree with bare branches stands near the foreground car. On the right, a row of colorful houses (red, green, pink) with white windows is visible behind a stone wall and white fence, with the asphalt road, marked with dashed white lines and yellow X-shapes, leading into the distance.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the street, the grey car on the left gradually exits the frame to the rear-left, revealing more of the yellow houses and stone wall. Subsequently, the dark car previously parked further up on the left also passes behind the viewer. More of the colorful houses on the right, including a prominent red one, shift out of view to the rear-right as the perspective advances, continuously revealing new sections of the street and houses further ahead.
