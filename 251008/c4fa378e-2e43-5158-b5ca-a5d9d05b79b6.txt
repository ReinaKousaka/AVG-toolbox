The first frame displays two snow-covered train tracks curving slightly left into the distance under an overcast sky, with snowy embankments holding sparse trees on the left and dense evergreens and a utility pole on the right; a tunnel entrance is visible further ahead on the left. end of description. As the viewpoint progresses forward along the tracks, the snow-covered landscape on both sides passes closer and then recedes to the left and right of the initial frame's central path. The tall evergreen tree initially on the left midground and the utility pole on the right foreground steadily approach, moving past as the tunnel entrance on the left draws nearer.

In the first frame, two snow-covered train tracks extend from the foreground into the distance, flanked by snow-dusted ground. To the left, a snow-covered embankment rises, dense with bare trees, while to the right, a solitary conifer stands amidst more bare trees in the mid-distance. Overhead wires crisscross the grey sky, supported by a utility pole in the right foreground, and a dark bridge structure spans diagonally across the tracks in the mid-background, where the tracks disappear beneath it.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward along the tracks, the snow-covered ground and surrounding trees recede while the bridge structure grows larger, revealing more details of its angled undercarriage and support pillars. A dark protective barrier or netting becomes distinctly visible on the left, running along the top of the embankment and below the bridge. The utility pole on the right also approaches and then passes the viewer, indicating continuous forward motion towards and under the bridge.

The first frame depicts snow-covered train tracks extending towards a large concrete bridge spanning diagonally across the midground. To the left is a snowy embankment with leafless trees and a concrete retaining wall, while a utility pole stands to the right of the tracks.
end of description
As the viewpoint moves forward, the retaining wall on the left and the utility pole on the right pass by on either side. The scene then moves into the dark shadow beneath the bridge, revealing its support pillars directly to the left and right overhead, before emerging to show the snowy forested landscape continuing beyond.
