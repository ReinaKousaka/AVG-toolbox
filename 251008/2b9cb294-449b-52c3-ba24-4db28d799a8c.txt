Throughout the subsequent frames, cars on the wet street continuously move away from the viewer, with a light-colored vehicle appearing from the mid-left and proceeding down the road. Concurrently, the person on the right sidewalk dynamically changes posture and shifts slightly to the right along the building. The rainy conditions and vivid reflections persist across the scene.
