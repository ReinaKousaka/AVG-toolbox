As the frames progress, the rightmost green door slowly opens, revealing a vibrant new room to the right of the initial scene. This newly exposed area features green and yellow tropical-patterned wallpaper, a dark wooden cabinet with gold accents, a white floral arrangement, and a dark television screen, all positioned beyond the opening door.
