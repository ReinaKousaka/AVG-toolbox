The first frame displays an urban street scene with a sidewalk on the right and a street on the left. In the foreground to the right, a woman wearing a backpack and holding several shopping bags walks away from the viewer. To the left in the midground, a dark gray SUV is parked next to a silver bicycle rack, with another lighter-colored SUV parked behind it. A tree with green leaves stands between the parked cars and the sidewalk in the center-left. Behind the tree, an outdoor dining structure featuring transparent walls and a rainbow flag decal is visible, with red barriers in front and people seated inside. A row of commercial buildings lines the right side of the frame, extending into the background, where more pedestrians are visible.
end of description
The woman in the foreground continues walking away from the first-frame viewpoint, moving further along the sidewalk to the right. A new pedestrian, a woman pushing a stroller with a child, enters the frame from the right midground and walks forward on the sidewalk, passing the outdoor dining structure. Subsequently, a dark red SUV drives into view on the street, behind the initially parked dark gray SUV.
