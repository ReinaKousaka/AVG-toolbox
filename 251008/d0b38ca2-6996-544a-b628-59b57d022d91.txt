The first frame displays a wet street with a crosswalk in the foreground, leading towards a distant cityscape under an overcast sky. A white car approaches on the left lane, behind several parked cars, while an orange traffic cone stands in the middle-right lane. To the right, a sidewalk features buildings and trees, with a dark SUV parked closest to the viewer. end of description. The white car steadily moves forward through the frames, advancing past the initial viewpoint on the wet road. All other elements, including the parked cars, traffic cone, buildings, and trees, remain fixed relative to the first-frame viewpoint.

The first frame presents a wet city street, reflecting an overcast sky and lined with buildings and lush trees. An orange traffic barrier stands centrally on the asphalt road, which features white arrow markings and yellow dashed lines on the right, while parked cars occupy the left curb. To the right, a sidewalk hosts a storefront displaying merchandise, alongside a tree and street furniture.

Chronologically, the central orange barrier first begins to lean to its right, while a second orange barrier further down the road also falls, revealing two black tires near it. The initially upright barrier then completely topples over to the right of its original position. Finally, this fallen barrier slides entirely out of view to the right, unveiling the road markings it once obscured.

The first frame captures a wet city street receding into the distance under an overcast sky. Centrally in the foreground, an orange road barrier stands on the asphalt, marked with a white 'X' and an arrow pointing left. To the viewer's left, a red SUV, a black sedan, and a silver sedan are parked along the street bordered by buildings and trees, while on the right, a yellow curb, a grey trash bin, some black items, and a white van are visible on the sidewalk, also lined with storefronts and trees.
end of description
The two orange barriers in the foreground gradually shift forward and slightly right relative to the first-frame viewpoint, progressively revealing more of the road behind them. Simultaneously, a yellow motorcycle/scooter emerges from the distant background, steadily approaching the viewer along the center of the wet street. A silver car positioned further down the right side of the street also slowly moves away from the viewer.
