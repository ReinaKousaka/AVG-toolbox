The first frame depicts a vibrant green grassy field filling the foreground. In the midground, to the right, a dark brown wooden house is partially visible, bordered by a wooden and chain-link fence. To its left and slightly further back stands a small stone building with a rusty metal roof and laundry hanging outside, surrounded by potted plants within a chain-link fence. Further left, behind the stone building, another large brown wooden house with a red-tiled roof is set on a grassy slope. The background is dominated by a steep, forested mountain face, with a sliver of sky visible in the top left.
end of description
A small white object appears on the balcony of the large wooden house to the viewer's right, which quickly transforms into a red flag with a white cross (Swiss flag). Subsequently, a figure appears on this same balcony. Later, another identical Swiss flag is revealed flying from a pole on the large wooden house in the midground, situated to the left of the small stone building.
