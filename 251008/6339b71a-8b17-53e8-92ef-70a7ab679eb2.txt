The first frame depicts a wide, barren, reddish-brown landscape under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds, featuring a dirt path ascending a prominent hill directly ahead of the viewer. A person in a bright yellow shirt jogs away from the viewer on this central path, with numerous data overlays displaying running metrics and a small map visible at the screen's periphery.

As the frames progress, the runner moves further away and higher up the main hill, remaining centrally positioned along the dirt path relative to the initial viewpoint. The surrounding barren landscape and background hills remain static, while the onscreen data overlays continuously update to reflect an increasing incline percentage and the runner's improving pace and speed.

The first frame shows a vast, arid landscape under a clear blue sky with some scattered white clouds in the upper left. A dirt path extends from the bottom center, leading towards a prominent reddish-brown conical hill directly ahead in the mid-ground, which is flanked by similar hills fading into the distance. A person in a bright yellow-green shirt and dark shorts is walking on this path, moving away from the viewer towards the distant hill. Various on-screen display elements provide data, including a gradient of +10.7% at the bottom left, and speed/time metrics at the bottom right.

In subsequent frames, the viewpoint steadily moves forward along the dirt path, following the runner who continues to ascend the terrain towards the conical hill ahead. The runner maintains a central position, moving further away from the initial viewpoint as the immediate foreground continuously reveals new sections of the path. The on-screen gradient measurement incrementally increases, reflecting the rising incline as the journey progresses.

In the first frame, a person wearing a bright yellow top and dark shorts is seen running away from the viewer on a reddish-brown dirt path that recedes towards a prominent, barren hill directly ahead in the distance. Undulating, dry hills stretch across the mid-ground to the left and right, meeting a clear blue sky with sparse white clouds. Overlayed data in the bottom left shows "0.7 km" and "+12.0%", while the bottom right displays "08:26/km," "7 km/h," "13:34/mi," and "00:07:13," along with a white route line showing distances like "207 m" and "94 m" along the path.
end of description
Across the subsequent frames, the runner continues to move steadily away from the viewer along the same dirt path, progressively nearing the distant hill. Simultaneously, the elapsed time displayed in the bottom right corner increases from 00:07:13 to 00:07:16, and the pace improves from 08:26/km to 08:10/km. The grade percentage in the bottom left also incrementally rises from +12.0% to +12.3% as the runner ascends.
